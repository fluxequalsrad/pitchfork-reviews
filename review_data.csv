0,"Ten years after his big solo debut, the UK producer goes even bigger for a well-polished record animated by the ecstatic and easy pleasures of the dancefloor. It’s been almost 10 years since we last heard at length from Jamie xx. 2015’s In Colour took the moody brand of minimalism his band the xx had perfected for a spin on the dancefloor. Since then, he’s scattered a few under-the-radar bits of production work for high-profile artists like Frank Ocean, Miley Cyrus, and Tyler, the Creator, as well as his bandmates’ solo records. In Colour peaked with the Romy feature “Loud Places,” in which she delineates the different reasons people have to go out: to find a lover to go home with, to find a reason to never go home again. And his co-production of Romy’s own “Enjoy Your Life” was a highlight of her 2023 debut, an instant anthem about letting go of the reasons why and embracing pleasure. The writer and nightlife scholar McKenzie Wark opens her classic book Raving with a statement of purpose. “First thing I look for at raves: who needs it.” Tracks like these offered a defense of this need and a depiction of it. They felt, they feel, essential.The pleasure of the dancefloor also animates his album-length return. In Waves generally plays to his strengths. These include simplicity: “Still Summer” is essentially a filtered trance chord progression, a kickdrum, and some screams; “The Feeling I Get From You” sets a collaged profession of love above some piano bar tinklings and an electro-y beat. Both are class acts. He also has a top-drawer guestlist, both sampled and in-person. His collab with the Avalanches brings the legendary poet Nikki Giovanni to the party via lifted stanzas of her Black Arts Movement “Dance Poem,” and if, like me, you might not necessarily have been the target audience for her 1976 calling-in of revolutionary children, the track’s psychedelic pop groove is welcoming nonetheless. “Baddy on the Floor” brings in the iconic Honey Dijon for a gospel-house stormer, easily the most vital track of the bunch. And “Life” lets Robyn, that disco bard of mixed emotions, rip. “Let’s fuck it up tonight,” she commands over French-touched house, and who would say no? Music sounds better with her.Even at its strangest—the poesy comedown of closer “Falling Together” or the electroclash freakout of “Dafodil,” in which Kelsey Lu, John Glacier, Panda Bear, and also A$AP Rocky get lost on a hot summer night—Waves is bigger than In Colour, in the spectacle of its sound and in the scope of possible audience. This is music that can be effortlessly slotted into mainstream house sets and diced into TikTok challenges, selected as soundtracks for your vacation Insta carousels and added to “memories of 2024” playlists. Nothing succeeds in dance music like dance music about dancing, and on that front, In Waves is the big time.",Electronic,7.3
1,"Riding the success of singles “Like That!” and “Not My Problem,” the 18-year-old New York vocalist and producer presents her own version of a throwback self-titled debut. Trying to convince a teen in the throes of passion that their feelings are not the summit of human emotion is a fool’s errand. On Gap Year!, the debut full-length from Laila!, young love blossoms and withers with crushing intensity. The New York vocalist and producer plants you directly into the whirlwind that is life before 18, muddling through mixed signals and dreaming of being asked to prom. All the while, her melodies sound as though they issue from bedrooms plastered in Brandy and Lauryn Hill posters, a compressed mixture of sincerity and wit.As the album title hints, Laila!—born Laila Smith, the daughter of rapper Yasiin Bey—is a dedicated student of the game. The self-described Brandy disciple graduated from high school a year early and began forging her path as a musician with nimble GarageBand flips of old Brandy and Aaliyah cuts. Her magnetic, carefree persona carried early singles “Like That!” and “Not My Problem,” which Cash Cobain subsequently flipped into a viral posse cut. The almost entirely self-produced Gap Year! is Laila!’s coming-out party, her own version of a throwback self-titled debut.The record plays out as casually as an after-school hang, full of titles and themes that might’ve been rattling around since the morning bell. On lo-fi acoustic opener “Talent Show,” the tactile sounds of amps being plugged in and mics being adjusted seem to play over a scratchy cafeteria PA. Powered by a punchy bassline that wouldn’t be out of place on an early 2000s 702 album, “If U Don’t Know by Now” quivers in anticipation of being noticed by a crush (until then, she’ll leave a note in their locker). The restrained production allows her voice to shine, capitalizing on a sense of familiarity without feeling like a cynical retread.On “Want 2,” Laila! lilts over a stripped-back, bouncy drum beat that spiritually belongs on the back half of the Like Mike soundtrack. Her croons carry an emotional conviction that makes you believe that she means every word. “Were we in love? That’s really what I wanna know/Tell me, what is it gonna take for you to let your feelings show?” she sings on “R U Down?” letting her voice carry as she puts the screws to a particularly frustrating guy.Gap Year! peaks when Laila! centers her vocal performance, acting as a conduit for waves of high-school feelings. In weaker passages, its 17 tracks start to blend together; the repeated musings on love and relationships, especially from an 18-year-old’s perspective, can feel predictable. But there’s plenty of artistic personality to be found here, like the joyful pocket Laila! catches as she spits on “Sani (Homework Freestyle)” and “Not My Problem,” or the falsetto that pierces through the opening bars of “Could Be.” The subject matter may come with an expiration date, but Laila!’s endless stream of heartfelt declarations are worthy of the yearbook pages: “All the love in the world/Is there for you to find,” she sings on the bridge of “Sink 2 Rise.” Maybe youthful idealism isn’t so foolish at all.",Pop,7.2
2,"On their debut collaboration, the beatmaker and the drummer search for middle ground between their respective styles, twisting programmed grooves and loose-limbed percussion into propulsive, polyrhythmic configurations. It’s not easy to tell who’s doing what on “Mata,” one of the highlights of Nídia and Valentina Magaletti’s debut album together. Neither artist has attempted a collaboration quite like this before, and perhaps that’s why it’s so propulsive. Beatmaker Nídia has never worked with a prominent multi-instrumentalist providing raw material on the fly; drummer Magaletti doesn’t typically work within a dance music context, especially not one like Nídia’s. In “Mata,” their scuffed congas, bongos, and synths go scrambling around the beat, alive with the anticipation of how they might interlock next. You can hear the two artists pushing each other as they meet in the middle.Raised between Bordeaux and her birthplace of Vale da Amoreira, in the greater Lisbon region, Nídia has moved outward from her roots in the Lisbon scene’s continuum of diasporic sounds, like kuduro and tarraxinha, from Lusophone Africa. Since emerging on SoundCloud as a teenager and joining the label Príncipe Discos, she’s put her spin on tracks from Fever Ray, Yaeji, and Kelela and mingled with a wide sweep of global party sounds to demonstrate just how far she can take her beats without losing her signature flair. The Italy-born, London-based Magaletti is similarly prolific on a different circuit: Whether she’s making post-hardcore with Moin, tight psychedelic jams with Tomaga, or her anthological solo projects, her unassuming but versatile approach treats percussion as a “narrative” in which each new breakbeat or clattering found object is a natural—and functional—rhythmic choice. Nídia and Valentina have been leaning in parallel directions lately. Nídia’s 2023 album 95 MINDJERES brought her strain of batida into a looser, more open-ended mode, uncannily approximating the improvisational feel of a live band with her laptop-producer chops. Meanwhile, a recent project by Magaletti’s dub band Holy Tongue with Shackleton spotlights the way dance music’s constraints can give a performer’s off-kilter textural idea the freedom to take root and evolve across an extended beat.Nídia and Magaletti’s collaborative debut, Estradas, gets a lot out of its setup. Each track is built out of shifting polyrhythms that they compose together: Magaletti plays various instrumental lines to make up the beats, while Nídia contributes her own programmed loops. The frothy MIDI snap of Nídia’s earlier projects gives way to a rigorous studio mix courtesy of Magaletti’s Moin bandmate Tom Halstead, with each instrument dutifully mic’d up and given space. When it’s played straight, adapting Nídia-style dance beats to an aesthetic closer to Raime can feel gratuitous, like those blown-out remixes of popular songs you hear in movie trailers. But the ensemble-oriented presentation helps the duo pull off some new tricks.",Electronic,7.8
3,"The Philly group’s second live album is a celebration of the band as a symbiotic unit and an impressive distillation of its cosmic Americana sound. Even in the band’s ramshackle early days, the War on Drugs’ music could change the dimensions of a room. They didn’t achieve this feat through sheer volume alone (though songs like “Show Me The Coast” or “It’s Your Destiny” could reach intimidating decibel levels) but through scope: enormous emotions peeking through the curtain of incandescent synths and droning guitar. They made hanging in a dingy rock club watching four wiry Philly dudes conjure a multicolored squall feel like standing on the edge of a cliff, the universe roaring in your ears that you’re smaller than you think. When the War on Drugs grew to a sextet to bring Lost in the Dream’s variegated haze to the stage, their sound pushed against the rafters of thousand-cap venues, fully realizing the kind of immensity music writers love to call “stadium-sized.”LIVE DRUGS, the band’s first live album, collected soundboard recordings from 2014 to 2019, focusing on cuts from Lost in the Dream and A Deeper Understanding. Four years later, they’re back with LIVE DRUGS AGAIN, sourcing takes from their 2022 and 2023 runs. Like its predecessor, LIVE DRUGS AGAIN feels like a single show, one where you lucked into the perfect spot in front of the soundboard, awestruck by a band that exudes the ineffable combination of tour-tight and casual. LIVE DRUGS AGAIN is an expansion in many ways: The band added multi-instrumentalist Eliza Hardy Jones in 2022, and the set draws heavily from 2021’s shimmering prairiecore opus I Don’t Live Here Anymore. It’s even more painstakingly assembled—Granduciel stitched this version of “Under the Pressure,” for example, from six different performances. Here, the music doesn’t smear together into a beautiful mass like the sound of the War on Drugs of yore; instead, it builds into a towering, complex structure.This new, seven-piece configuration of the War on Drugs plays with remarkable patience. There’s a newfound—or at least newly emphasized—attention to the interlocking rhythms that bolster the songs’ swooning Heartland core. Granduciel’s solos aren’t as jammy as in the past, trading the minutes-long shred sessions for a more measured take on hypnotic maximalism. The band assembles “Living Proof” brick by brick, starting with sixteenth-note guitar strums, then adding eighth-note hi-hats, syncopated bass drums, and that hooky keyboard line that hovers in a fog of reverb. It’s almost techno-like in construction, meticulously building tension and ending in a quietly cathartic payoff when the groove downshifts into its roots-rock coda. During some songs, you can pick out one element—the dusty Linn Drum backbone of “Burning,” Dave Hartley’s motorik bassline during “Slow Ghost”—and follow it like a single stream into a tremendous waterfall.",Rock,7.9
4,"Laser eye surgery enabled the guitarist to see clearly. Their new album draws on the improvisatory techniques of free jazz to explore the slippery nature of human perception. Throughout Viewfinder, the latest album by the prolific guitarist and collaborator Wendy Eisenberg, the sound of the room is often not just audible, but conspicuous. At the outset of “Set a Course,” the member of Editrix, Birthing Hips, and the Bill Orcutt Quartet sings a capella, their notes clear and plainspoken and long, and the softly hissing presence of the recording space becomes increasingly close. It may seem strange to remark on the subtlest part of an album that revolves around a 22-minute noise epic that constantly collapses in and out of sync. But the room tone feels like it’s there to be noticed.Viewfinder was inspired by the Maryland-raised, Brooklyn-based musician’s experience getting laser surgery to remedy a lifetime of eye problems. The disorienting experience of being able to see clearly for the first time sent them diving into the concept of sight, studying the work of John Berger, Jacqueline Rose, and the quack medic who blinded Handel and Bach. Eisenberg’s wide-ranging research prompted them to consider the subjectivity and potential oppressiveness of being defined by a single perspective. In the same way that a printed photograph makes the permanence of a split-second clear—how “a picture lives a lifetime out of time,” as Eisenberg states on “If an Artist”—foregrounding the materiality of the recording highlights the idea that these 79 improvisatory minutes were just 79 minutes among potentially many more; that although this is the recording of the ensemble’s work you are hearing, that doesn’t necessarily make it definitive.It’s indicative of the slipperiness of Viewfinder, which starts with “Lasik,” Eisenberg’s account of getting eye surgery. Above all, it’s a warning to themself—and by extension, any listener hoping for easy platitudes about life in hi-def—that “changing isn’t healing.” If anything, the six-minute track suggests the opposite: fraught and close, low horns lurking like flickering shadows, Eisenberg’s guitar locked into a minor half-siren motif, the drums skittish and dry and close; but then the guitar being stroked up and down the fretboard, the effect tender but disorientating, followed by tense static and grave violin sawing. The knotted construction of the song, and Eisenberg’s serious, earnest tone throughout, bring to mind Phil Elverum or British iconoclast Richard Dawson, and how both stake out their territory with the tension of deepening inquiry, stretching the limits of what is known.In the liner notes, Eisenberg concludes: “Since writing this music, I have begun to comfort myself with the notion that loving something does not require that what is beloved be understood.” Viewfinder is primarily instrumental, spanning free jazz, post-rock, flashes of beauty, and pockets of mournfulness. Its textures are wild and tangled, with repeating harmonic patches that quickly slip away. There is the temptation with any instrumental music to overlay a narrative—and not least when a record like this dangles such easy metaphors as clarity, obscurity, and resistance. So the lightest way to frame these digressions might be as reflections of the joy of discovery, of allowing things to change and marveling as they do.",American,7.7
5,"On her third album, the UK singer-songwriter sounds relaxed, confident, unflappably cool, even in moments of conflict. The result is an album of everyday luxury, lush and unhurried. The way Nilüfer Yanya plays the guitar, with a hollow picking, it’s like she’s scratching an incessant itch. It’s an intimate feeling to be let in on as a listener, but it’s also given her songs an occasional harried edge. The British indie musician’s first album, 2019’s Miss Universe, was raucous and bold, but when she sang of “lying in a pool of someone else’s blood,” you didn’t get the feeling she was exactly relaxed. Her second album, 2022’s PAINLESS (a misdirection of a title if I ever heard one), throbbed with Yanya’s honeyed vocals wrapped around her serpentine guitar melodies. The music was tantalizing but it was anxious, sometimes showy. Not a bad thing, but it felt self-conscious, like she had something to prove. On her third and best album, My Method Actor, she’s matured, found herself, chilled out—whatever you want to call it, it’s made her music more triumphant, less nervous. It’s an album that has the feel of everyday luxury, a collection of songs so assured that they feel like they always existed, and Yanya simply plucked them out of the air to give to you.She’s not without her problems (the thorniness of romance is a lyrical theme), but instead of shredding out her frustrations out with a gnarly riff or a honking saxophone solo, she owns them poetically, giving a torch singer’s graceful performance across the album’s 11 songs. Yanya’s signature guitar sound is still present, but the itch has been scratched. Some of that newfound ease may be thanks to songwriter Wilma Archer, once an electronic music producer known as Slime who co-wrote My Method Actor with Yanya. This is the first album where Yanya has worked with only one producer, and having a steady collaborator gives the album a cohesion you may not have noticed the previous two didn’t have. The sound is unhurried and lush, with Yanya’s voice confidently tender.“I’m a loser first/Come on do your worst,” she taunts on album opener “Keep On Dancing,” in a line that might recall a classic retort from Girls’ Hannah Horvath: “Any mean thing someone’s gonna think of to say about me, I’ve already said to me, about me.” Except (no spoilers) I don’t think Hannah actualized the lesson from that kind of self-critique in the way Yanya has. What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. In fact, “Keep On Dancing” begins with a moment of vinegar, a gauntlet thrown. “What you looking for?/Shut up and raise your glass if you’re not sure/Still I can smile, it’s fucking miserable/So deep in the crime of being beautiful.” She says “shut up” in a way that drips with bile, and delivers the rest of the lines unapologetically. Whoever she is talking to deserves it.",Pop,8.5
6,"On his heaviest, spikiest album to date, Aaron Maine’s shredded production and raw arrangements evoke existential angst and quotidian despair. Aaron Maine has always had a complicated relationship with rock’n’roll. In the early 2010s, his band Porches crystallized around unsteady and unsettled guitar music fit for the scrappy DIY venues and dingy basements he often played across the Northeast. Since then, his songs of yearning have become more experimental and opaque, taking tangents through misty synth-pop (2016’s Pool), dreamy dance music (2018’s The House), and blunted ballads that recall Arthur Russell’s lonesome home recordings (2020’s Ricky Music). But recently, he’s been thinking about getting loud again.On tour in support of the exuberant pop songs from 2021’s All Day Gentle Hold !, Maine got a chance to indulge that urge. He turned up the distortion on his guitar, thrashed around the stage, and screamed—a way of exorcizing the anxiety and unhinged energy that lurks beneath his music, even at its softest. These shows provided the immediate spark for Shirt, Maine’s sixth studio album as Porches, a collection of the most crushing songs he’s recorded to date.The record’s heaviest moments document what he’s called the “precarious emotional state” that he put himself in while making the record. Working in a windowless basement rehearsal space and smoking “a lot of weed” for the first time in his life, he allowed himself to explore an emotional terrain he doesn’t often access. He wrote songs about existential anxiety and day-to-day distress, accompanying the abstract yet upsetting imagery of his lyrics with shredded production and raw arrangements.Single “Rag” is perhaps most indicative of the intensity that Maine reaches toward throughout Shirt. Wounded and paranoid, he braids together lyrics about libidinous desire and flickering violence over a blown-out instrumental that evokes Deerhunter’s in-the-red adventures on Monomania. The coiled intensity of “Sally” recalls the gnarled miniatures that Maine’s former tourmate Alex G nestled between love songs on his own early records. On “Itch,” Maine further explores this distorted desperation, offering words of piety and pain while slamming away on menacing guitar chords that clang and clatter like an oil drum striking concrete.Shirt’s most striking moments twist these familiar rock tropes into something more uncanny. Auto-Tune, an occasional fixation of Maine’s, renders his voice gooey and gross, smearing it across the tracks like a bug caught under a windshield wiper. Even as guitars loom in the foreground, there are also moments like the narcotic ballad “Precious,” where every layer sounds unsteady and tense, as if a sinkhole might open up and swallow it.",Rock,7.2
7,"The New York experimental duo gets meta on a concept album about experimental music that’s littered with meme effects and shitpost irreverence. It feels like a Discord thread set to music. In F. Scott Fitzgerald’s 1936 essay “The Crack-Up,” the writer describes a period in which his mind runs amok; he loses the desire to strive and socialize and withers into a sad-sack cynic. His main source of entertainment is list-making—football players, popular songs, suits he’s worn—and he becomes bitter about the most trivial things. He reflects that once upon a time, before the crack-up, he fancied it “a romantic business to be a successful literary man—you were not ever going to be as famous as a movie star but what note you had was probably longer-lived.” It must feel similar to be an experimental musician, nobly laboring to shatter the boundaries of sound, yet receiving minimal fanfare and being misconstrued by critics. Jack Callahan and Jeff Witscher’s debut joint record, Think Differently, unravels like a musical midlife crisis. It interrogates their careers and the experimental scene but also feels like a long improv sketch, a self-aware simulation of two avant-gardists losing their head and going pop. Call it SoundClown performance art.Think Differently’s hyper-eclectic pulp-rock and quivering Auto-Tune hooks will startle anyone who’s only familiar with their stim-board sound collages. Take Callahan’s Trap Studies, which rewired Zaytoven and Lex Luger shards into what sounds like an isolated FL Studio layer left on loop after the producer fell asleep. Network Glass’ Twitch, released on Witscher’s label, pooled audio from random streams into a frazzled info overload. The closest thing to Think Differently is their surreal 2023 performance “Bring the Flowers to the Theatre,” where they deadpanned on insular themes like review scores and delay effects and punctuated sentences with inane FX. It might be the only performance in history to include jokes about Ridgewood gentrification and also the “BABA BOOEY” groan.The album plays out the same—sardonic and sincere skits about their lives as musicians constantly interrupted by puerile soundbites—but with a new layer of zany alt-rock and trip-hop. Instead of Fitzgerald writing lists of cavalry leaders and football players, the duo assembled a terabytes’ worth of meme effects. They seem to have deliberately chosen the most grating and overused sounds, perhaps to express their dread about the internet and cultural sterility. There’s a Roblox “oof” grunt, the Taco Bell bong, and “ohmaaagawd.” There’s an interpolation of Linkin Park’s “In the End”; one song deploys Masked Wolf’s infamously awful ""Astronaut in the Ocean"" as a riser. The opener is a spoken-word remix of “I miss the old Kanye,” but this time what’s pined for is music with “soul.” It lashes against the “Bandcamp bestowed,” “status quo,” “bar so low” music of today; there are vocals from AI versions of Mr. Krabs and Peter Griffin. Imagine a meme megamix for washed-up Redditors—it’s the kind of album that works best as fodder for Discord debates, not necessarily as a repeat listening experience.",Experimental,6.3
8,"On their self-titled fifth album, the cult emo rockers construct a story of hard work, disillusionment, and nu-metal. Failure is the secret of Foxing’s success. The St. Louis band’s most popular songs to date are either about romantic rejection or religious trauma, or the indignity of having to relive those indignities onstage, or the financial precarity that comes with reliving those indignities onstage instead of, I dunno, getting a desk job with health benefits. Before the release of 2021’s Draw Down the Moon, drummer Jon Hellwig joked that Foxing might have been better off if the album flopped, giving them an excuse to opt out of emo-indie cult stardom and start playing nu-metal. That didn’t exactly happen, but they made their “Break Stuff” anyway. “Carson MTV! Bizkit NYE! Fuck! Fuck! Fuuuck!” guitarist Eric Hudson shrieks on the priceless chorus of “Hell 99,” a stadium-sized skramz spasm that is arguably the most aggro and the most catchy Foxing song yet, and undeniably the first that sounds like they’re having fun. After a decade shooting for the stars, Foxing is the sound of a band liberated by wallowing in the mud.By swapping the sounds of Coachella 2012 for Woodstock ’99, “Hell 99” might appear as a course correction for Draw Down the Moon, an album that couldn’t totally beat the Grouplove allegations but had fathoms of dread beneath its Day-Glo exterior. Singer Conor Murphy means to be taken at face value when he blares, “Throw out all the joy and show me metrics for my failures.” But the only major difference between the subject matter of Foxing and its predecessor is that the latter lacked any songs about his dog dying. This album counts at least two.Think of Foxing as Nearer My God’s evil genius twin: the type that spends more time in detention than study hall and still ends up with an A. Where in the past the band’s experimentalism was anchored by clean, rafter-reaching choruses, Foxing genre-leaps without a net, trusting its weirdest impulses to embellish and deliver the hooks. No spoilers for opener “Secret History”: Just know that by comparison, “Hell 99” is kind of a breather, at least before a refrain of “Constant shame! Constant fatigue!” hyperventilates into an ambient collapse. “Gratitude” is the one Obama-core throwback, performed with a white-knuckled intensity equal to the parts of Foxing that might credibly be compared to Deafheaven, Knocked Loose, and, in the case of “Dead Internet,” a Soundgarden mp3 playing through a dial-up modem.",Rock,7.8
9,"The Philadelphia trio pays tribute to a baffling 1984 LP of programmed drums and indulgent guitar recorded by an obstinate Lou Reed collaborator. They’re not so much imitators as acolytes. Few people understood Basic when it came out and even fewer liked it. By 1984, Robert Quine was already legendary for his guitar work on Richard Hell and the Voidoids’ Blank Generation and Lydia Lunch’s Queen of Siam. He had recorded several albums with Lou Reed, who he adored and hated in equal measure, and with whom he constantly clashed. The notoriously contentious Quine had done his time in the New York City underground and was sick of being sidelined by its outsized personalities. He decided to join up with Reed’s drummer Fred Maher and create a record exactly how he liked: a bizarre mix of programmed drums, ambient drift, and indulgent guitar explorations. These sounds were outré at the time, but they quickly became dated. Quine didn’t care. “On Basic, the drums are too loud and this and that but that's the way I wanted it,” he said in 1997. “If people don't appreciate the damn thing, I have no interest in banging my head against the wall.”According to Philadelphia guitarist Chris Forsyth, everybody’s gotten it wrong. He places Quine in the company of Miles Davis, Brian Eno, and Joni Mitchell and compares Basic to their landmark albums. Quine and Maher’s overlooked record has influenced Forsyth’s music for years, most obviously on the 20-minute guitar workout “Techno Top” from 2019’s All Time Present. But he wasn’t as alone as he thought—a resurgence of interest in Quine’s work was underway, and he was thrilled to discover that his Solar Motel Band guitarist Nick Millevoi was also a fan. During the pandemic lockdowns, Forsyth and Millevoi got together with a drum machine, using Basic as a conceptual starting point for dual-guitar jams. They quickly discovered that the collaboration made sense even to people who didn’t know about Robert Quine. And so they recruited a percussionist, Natural Information Society’s Mikel Patrick Avery, and started a band. In honor of their foundational text, they called it BASIC.Here are the basic elements of a This is BASIC song: polyrhythmic drum programming a bit too high in the mix, like Quine would’ve done; Avery’s percussion adding a steady groove; Millevoi’s thundering baritone guitar; and Forsyth’s lead lines ringing out over top. When they play live, Avery sits behind a bass drum, cowbell, and shaker, with two guitarists flanking him. Everyone can always see each other; this friendly surveillance is necessary for the band’s semi-improv. On “For Stars of the Air,” the album’s sprawling, nine-minute opener, Forsyth adds chiming harmonics over the drum machine’s jittery hi-hat until Millevoi steps in with shuddering waves of baritone, allowing Forsyth to move along to an intricate, flanged-out solo. Only after this interplay is established does Avery complicate the beat, propelling the group forward in double time. Once any two players lock into a pattern, the third is free to roam until he finds a new fixation, and so each track can change direction with a nod or a reciprocal glance: We’ve got this, go your own way.",Rock,7.6
10,"A December 2023 performance recorded in the guitarist’s beloved hometown displays his playing at its most expressive and expansive. A few songs into Live in Amarillo, Texas, Hayden Pedigo lays out a few flaws that other people see in his hometown. Out on the road, he says, he’s aware Amarillo has a reputation as a “flat, windy, hot, cold, brutal, and somewhat ugly place.” Yet the guitarist has dedicated many of his meditative pieces to what he’s called the city’s “hard-earned beauty.” He once told a local TV station that something he most appreciated about living there was the unique experience of standing in a field stretching to the horizon in every direction. “It’s almost like a small piece of infinity,” he said. His music seeks to capture that feeling, each slowly unfurling melody a chance to lose yourself in the vastness of a single moment.Live in Amarillo, Texas, recorded in December 2023 at the theater that houses the city’s orchestra, shows Pedigo’s playing at its most expressive and expansive. The record’s six instrumental tracks—some of which stitch together multiple songs—stretch his winding compositions into otherworldly journeys that place grave importance on each phrase and pause. Opener “Carthage” (originally from 2021’s Letting Go) demonstrates the emotional weight of such an approach. Pedigo coaxes delicate, dreamy melodies from a 12-string guitar, playing softly before they fade into silence. Another guitar line drifts across the room, purposefully quiet. By the time the song builds to its more labyrinthine figures, the piece has paused a handful of times, giving even the most gently lilting melodies a sense of unease: At any moment, Pedigo might recede into the shadows and fall silent.Pedigo presents some songs in more twisted and deliberately heavy forms than he ever has on record. In its original incarnation on Letting Go, “Rained Like Hell” was a stately acoustic piece that evoked the spiritual odysseys of Florian Fricke. The live performance is more frayed and unsettled, pulling slowly yet violently at the melodies, as if they were strapped to a rack. Pedigo has hinted at his affection for metal—he wore corpse paint in the “Letting Go” video—but this is the first time he’s conveyed it in his music. It plays like one of the frigid interludes that marked ’90s black metal albums, if any of those acts had been just a little more into the blues.Over the years, Pedigo has developed a reputation as one of experimental music’s most irrepressible pranksters. He’s trolled local businesses, posted goofy fits on Reddit until he was invited to walk for Gucci, and launched a bid for Amarillo City Council with a surreal, distorted camcorder video (he ultimately finished second to the incumbent). Live in Amarillo, Texas bears little trace of this side of his personality. In the between-song patter captured on the record, his mood is reflective and nostalgic, fitting the sentimental renditions heard throughout the performance. Pedigo’s studio recordings consistently illustrate his skill as a guitarist, but Live in Amarillo, Texas demonstrates his greatest talent isn’t technical fireworks. A glowing emotional core presents itself in these stretched-out arrangements and stripped-down moments, something raw and real that reveals itself with every breath and halting pause.",Rock,7.6
11,"On its debut LP, this trio of L.A. 20-somethings digs into au courant grunge and shoegaze influences to come up with fresh, compelling alt-rock epics rendered in miniature. In 1995, Sonic Youth, then 14 years into their career, and on the cusp of a mainstream breakthrough, released a new album, Washing Machine, that closed with a nearly 20-minute song, “The Diamond Sea.” Much of it is a freeform jam of slowly unfurling guitar noise. Seemingly aware of the unpalatableness of a double-digit running time largely given over to feedback, the band released a radio edit of “Diamond Sea,” a fine enough if relatively neutered four-minute version that cuts out the squall. Its purpose was served, to a limit: The song did chart—though never higher than No. 23. Critical success abounded, but the mass market never quite caught on.By the time the members of the Los Angeles band julie were born (about halfway between the release of “Diamond Sea” and Sonic Youth’s dissolution in 2011), the brief promise of a mainstream moment for difficult rock music, in the wake of Nirvana’s success, was long in the rearview. It was now the Obama years. Boom time for Coldplay fans, not so much dissonance enthusiasts.But enter Trump, and dark clouds came to pass, as did middle-school graduation; in 2019, as high schoolers, guitarist/vocalist Keyan Pourzand, bassist/vocalist Alexandria Elizabeth, and drummer Dillon Lee, formed julie. The band’s first single, “flutter,” was released in 2020, a year in which talented young devotees of experimental rock music had plenty of reason to shrink from the known world and swath themselves in oceanic swaths of reverb.julie emerged fully formed on “flutter,” a tightly wound grunge-pop rager with Pourzand and Elizabeth trading vocals, both pleasingly apathetic. That song, like most of the rest of their subsequent songs, was propelled by a totally ballistic drum performance by Lee. They were influenced by Sonic Youth, clearly, but they had little interest in that band’s atonal wandering. Julie’s power was controlled out of the gate.Over the next three years, the group released a handful of EPs and singles, experimenting with slight shifts in sound. One song might skew more tortured emo, another more triumphant shoegaze. The brusque sheen of the Big Muff pedal is ever present, but they never overindulge in fuzzed-out theatrics. They never noodle too long. Only one song on the band’s debut album, my anti-aircraft friend, clocks in at over five minutes—and then only by three seconds. It seems that in a generation (or two) since the heyday of their preferred breed of experimental rock music, julie have mastered the task of making songs that feel sprawling and massive, but which in reality bloom and dissolve in short order. You can fit a lot of julie songs into one “Diamond Sea.” No radio edit needed.",Rock,8.1
12,"The New York rappers develop the contours of their voices, adding shading and depth to what could otherwise come off as exhaustingly mechanical. The defining moment for Phiik and Lungs so far remains a grainy video of the duo standing before racks of t-shirts in a Hoboken vintage store, rapping like their lives depend on it. As a droning loop unfurls and a raspy voice croaks, “What the fuck is good,” two boyish-looking white guys emerge, black hoodies cinched around their faces. Lungs, whose blond brows and eyelashes intensify his unblinking gaze, raps like a wartime Morse code transmission, warning of an impending anxiety attack. His skinny frame is almost alien; he jabs a bony index finger at each syllable to ensure the doomsday message sinks in. Behind him, Phiik bobs like a sidelined AND1 hooper, occasionally mouthing along. When he’s up, he darts to the mic, immediately unwinding a percussive flow that ripples and sputters like raindrops on a drumhead. “Life is anything but a dream,” he spits, “and I’m foaming at the mouth.”The video, which was filmed for Top Shelf Premium’s Off Top freestyle series, captures the sheer intensity of Phiik and Lungs as a duo. Their chemistry comes easy. They both grew up on Long Island and have been friends since high school, sharing an admiration of early Def Jux and Wu-Tang records. In 2014, Lungs joined Tase Grip, the New York City collective founded by AKAI SOLO. Phiik quickly followed suit. Theirs is a tape-saturated, dusty-but-digital sound, fresh and immediate but strikingly outside of time. The four entries in the pair’s Another Planet series, all produced by Lungs himself under the moniker LoneSword, are full of frantic, imagistic rapping over distressed samples and the occasional brittle drum loop. On Another Planet 4, the two pushed their eccentric flows further than before, partly to see if they could, but mostly, as Phiik put it on the Reel Notes podcast, to “bang ‘em over the head.”Houston producer Olasegun helms the boards on their new album Carrot Season, providing sunlit, loungey beats full of vibraphones, chorused guitars, and crisp Pete Rock snares. It’s still highly insular music, a mesmerizing deluge of internal rhymes and intricately arranged syllables, surely the product of round-the-clock recording sessions and bottomless bags of weed. But the rappers have more fully developed the contours of their voices, adding shading and depth to what could otherwise come off as exhaustingly mechanical.Much of the record’s buoyancy comes from Phiik and Lungs’s palpable love for the craft. It’s clear they’re both committed to rap as a practice, fascinated by the mechanics and malleability of language (in that same Reel Notes interview, Phiik recalls seeing a garbage bag full of Lungs’s rhyme books, each page filled to the margins). Lungs still raps like a ticker tape printout but finds the areas of give in his once-rigid cadence. On songs like “Who // Eagle Eye” and “Kurt McBurt,” he thaws his creaking monotone with a soft lilt, giving his rambly, punctuation-free lines a bit more space. Phiik’s flow is lithe, often graceful, bouncing between drums like protons seeking a negative charge. He’ll fixate on a particular sound and observe it from all angles, like on “Daily Operation:” “Sunrises with only psilocybin and simple silence/I’m breaking the science behind waking up a sleeping giant.”",Rap,7.6
13,"The New York rapper refines his horndog anthems into a true pervert’s cocktail: crass, silly, and genuine. Chow Lee treats being horny as a bona fide artform. “You and your coochie is twins/You’ve got a beautiful vagina,” he repeats on “ms. beautiful V!,” his biggest single this year. Go ahead and call him shameless, but his sex raps offer a true pervert’s cocktail: crass, silly, and genuine. The New York rapper serves up this mélange à trois garnished with snappy punchlines, the banter always playful. Only a charismatic goofball could use the pickup line, “Wanna have sex? I’m the best sexer!” and come out looking slick. Lee’s self-abasement is a reminder that intimacy requires vulnerability, but it also underlines another truth: Fucking, and everything leading up to it, should be fun.When Lee and Cash Cobain dropped 2 Slizzy 2 Sexy a couple years ago, the duo rapped over Tong Li and Prince Royce tracks, announcing sample drill as fertile ground for cosmopolitan horndog anthems. Compared to other amorous styles (lovers rock, pagode romântico), sexy drill is musically and lyrically brash, addictive for its hedonistic indulgences. On his 2023 solo album Hours After the Club, Lee amped up the Jersey club kicks and nocturnal ambience while crooning about G-spots, his Auto-Tune cutting through flashy synths. His new album, Sex Drive, arrives amid a surge of sexy drill, but while artists like wolfacejoeyy and Baby Osama have brought the sound into new territories, Lee remains the genre’s greatest entertainer.Lee lives to please, and Sex Drive refines his craft: He’s still a riot, but these 19 songs are thoughtfully arranged to reveal the subtleties of his sexual pursuits. On opener “advance w her!,” the kick drum ruptures the air before shifting to a lighter, Jersey-inspired floater. His one-track mind revs with racecar intensity; his declaration that he could never get married serves as a victory lap. He’s of a different mind on “LSD,” a sultry R&B track led by drifting synths. He sings about earning love and working through conflict, bringing up cunnilingus in the sweetest tone. Occasionally, we hear a woman moan as Lee sings about wifing her. Our libido, Sex Drive reminds us, can unearth new versions of ourselves.Though Lee can handily carry a song on his own, the best features on Sex Drive elevate his storytelling. Flo Milli’s verse on the “swag it!” remix is so cocksure that it reframes Lee’s constant questioning as impassioned pleading. Anycia’s presence on “get back!” is similarly domineering. Her slow drawl stands forward in the mix, making Lee sound like a grateful kid as he sings “Damn!” in a squirrely voice. The men’s contributions are more mixed. “tequila vacay!” is most egregious, opting for vaguely tropical mush as singer Roy Woods does his best Weeknd and Post Malone impressions. Unsurprisingly, Cobain and Bay Swag’s appearances on “act bad twin!” are a highlight: It’s a Jersey club slow jam that samples PARTYNEXTDOOR and lands in a pool of dreamy synths. Hearing Lee sing about a woman “trying to match [his] sins” is a moment of sincere tenderness.The maximalist beats of “addys!” and “bangbang!” stack up sounds into rapturous, multisensory ecstasy. More straightforward tracks like “settings!” get by on the strength of Lee’s conviction (“I cannot power down!”). Sex Drive ends with “skeleTONS,” where a 40-esque beat from producer Skeyez positions the record as post-Drake—think gauzy instrumentals laced with heart-on-sleeve confessionals, except, you know, actually exciting to hear in 2024. It’s Lee’s versatility across all these styles that make his constant fantasizing feel like a worthwhile model for living. In his hands, plain old perversion is made to feel prismatic.",Rap,7.7
14,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit an immortal 1995 dub-techno manifesto that forged links between Berlin, Detroit, and Jamaica, dissolving dance music’s throb into an ambient haze. The first records to carry the Basic Channel name wore it quietly, stretching and distorting the text across each record’s center label, and rendering it fainter with each release. Was Basic Channel an artist’s name? Placed alongside titles like “Phylyps Trak” and “Quadrant Dub,” the early records seemed to imply as much, even as others, like “Enforcement” and “Inversion,” were credited to someone called Cyrus. Perhaps, then, Basic Channel was a record label. But who was Cyrus? And who was responsible for pressing these elegant 12"" singles?With visual design that nodded to conceptual art’s brief fascination with Xerox machines during the 1960s, they made a clean break with the futuristic features of Detroit techno, which was just beginning to settle into orthodoxy by the early 1990s. Wherever they came from and whoever was behind them, nothing else sounded quite like Basic Channel.The project moved quickly, producing nine 12"" singles for the label between 1993 and 1994. The records were austere yet intricately constructed, using atmospheric synths and studio effects to create astoundingly dense structures that revealed new patterns with each listen. The duo’s first single, 1993’s “Enforcement,” accosts listeners with a brutal synth loop that repeats, with slight variations, for the duration of the 13-minute track. Yet those subtle changes make all the difference; muffled hi-hats and hard-panned synth pulses peek through at steady intervals, colliding with the original synth sequence to reveal new contours as the track progresses. The approach borrows as much from Manuel Göttsching’s motorik E2-E4 as it does from the dizzying phase music of minimalist pioneer Steve Reich, churning forward at a relentless pace without inducing fatigue.The pair would ultimately turn away from thundering techno, shifting their focus to subtle textures. But the single contains a template for much of what would follow, introducing mixing techniques that prioritize space, as well as a careful focus on process, that Mark Ernestus and Moritz von Oswald—the press-shy individuals eventually revealed as the artists behind the alias—would carry throughout their careers. The track, like others including “Q1.1/I” and “Octagon,” was heavily inspired by Detroit techno, taking influence from Juan Atkins, Jeff Mills, Robert Hood, and labels like Metroplex and Underground Resistance. This scene was the blueprint from which Basic Channel would establish—and perfect—a completely new sound of their own. To purists both then—a period when techno’s sprawling nightlife network was just beginning to coalesce against the backdrop of German reunification—and now, dub techno begins and ends with Basic Channel, whose 1995 compilation BCD remains the genre’s defining document.",Electronic,9.4
15,"The 10th anniversary edition of Days Before Rodeo, Travis Scott’s breakout mixtape, is a time capsule of the rapper’s chameleonic production prowess and budding curatorial skill. In the dwindling months of summer 2014, Travis Scott’s obsession with curation began to take shape in the public eye. A few days before his mixtape Days Before Rodeo (a teaser for his official debut, Rodeo) hit SoundCloud on August 18, Metro Boomin posted a behind-the-scenes video chronicling the making of Travis and Young Thug’s song “Skyfall.” Between frenetic camera cuts, you’re treated to shots of Travis and Metro piecing together “Skyfall” as smoke billows in the background. Scott bounces between playful exuberance and meticulous micromanagement, imploring engineer Alex Tumay to remove drums and adjust bass levels, all under the watchful eye of the camera.It’s not unreasonable to think of Days Before Rodeo as the linchpin for Travis Scott’s massive success. He wanted to be a star; if his next move had been a misfire, he might have had to settle for a spot in the middle of the pack. The 10-year anniversary deluxe edition of Days Before Rodeo, available on streaming and vinyl for the first time in a decade with a slew of new tracks, is a time capsule of Scott’s chameleonic production prowess and his budding curatorial skill, even as it begins to reveal the penchant for vapid spectacle that would lead him astray.By the time Scott’s buzzy 2013 debut mixtape Owl Pharaoh arrived, his career felt as though it just needed one final push to get over the hump. He’d already secured co-signs from Kanye West and T.I., earning touted placements as an in-house producer for G.O.O.D. Music (credits on Yeezus’ “Guilt Trip” and “New Slaves,” with lingering speculation that Scott was a catalyst behind the album’s angsty tonal shift). He lent his talents to Jay-Z’s Magna Carta and Wale’s The Gifted. By virtue of association, Scott had strapped on the proverbial jetpack.Those simmering expectations boil over on the growled refrain of Days Before Rodeo opener “The Prayer”: “I might fuck ’round lose my mind, I gotta break out,” he raps, making the act of saying grace sound more like a warning shot. Compared to later releases, Days Before Rodeo is an exercise in restraint, lacking an extensive list of lyrical features (but full of production assists from FKi 1st, Metro Boomin, and Lex Luger). Still, the tape hits clear highs when Scott rolls out the red carpet for more capable rappers. The marriage between blistering hi-hats and spaghetti Western samples make “Mamacita” feel as though Young Thug and the late Rich Homie Quan are gallivanting through a gunfight at the O.K. Corral, with Scott trailing behind. “Skyfall” sets up a brilliant contrast between Scott’s baritone hums and Thug’s piercing raps, coming off as a slow march to desolation accompanied by play-by-play from vengeful spirits.",Rap,7.7
16,"Three years after exploring new dimensions in ambient jazz alongside Pharoah Sanders, Sam Shepherd refocuses his efforts on the dancefloor, with dazzling results. In 2014, Sam Shepherd wrote a career-defining tune in a matter of minutes. “Nuits Sonores” was finished on a flight to the Lyon festival of the same name, and it sounds as effortless as it apparently was, climbing towards the heavens without boiling over into excess. This is one of Shepherd’s two main modes—when he’s not a jazz auteur, he’s a crack house and techno producer. (He also has a PhD in neuroscience and is a revered and adventurous selector behind the decks.) That other side has won him fame from all corners of the music industry, culminating in Promises, his 2021 collaboration with Pharoah Sanders. More recently, he’s been taking to huge festival stages with crossover DJs like Caribou and Four Tet, following them in their quests to infiltrate the mainstream on their own terms. All those parts of Floating Points are connected, but not always obviously. Enter Cascade, an album that bolsters Shepherd’s club cunning with his musical chops in service of one single-minded mission: blissing out on the dance floor.The rollout for Cascade started back in 2022 with “Vocoder,” an industrial-strength anthem to file alongside “Nuits Sonores” and 2019’s “LesAlpx.” “Vocoder (Club Mix)” opens the album in a boisterous rush, careening toward a breakdown of clipped vocal samples that spill out like a cargo of french fries from a turned-over semi. It’s nearly reckless by Floating Points standards, capturing that feeling when the strobes hit hard and you can’t tell if the lights are getting to you or you’re just more faded than you thought.The raucous album is a direct sequel to 2019’s aggressive Crush. On that record, Shepherd showcased his newfound mastery of modular synthesis, creating cresting waves of fuzz and distortion that bore down on fitful rhythms and unpredictable song structures—the result, he said, of opening huge venues for the xx and wanting to challenge the audience with “chaotic” music. This time he’s focused on making people move instead of befuddling them. Cascade is what happened when Shepherd wasn’t able to tour at all, an exorcism of dancefloor impulses impeded by the pandemic and then nurtured by the return of DJ gigs. In the midst of recording it, he decamped to the Southern California desert to write the score for a ballet, which makes Cascade a holiday and a reckoning all in one.These tracks redirect the jazzy vamp of classic records like Shadows into zig-zagging journeys, like those ’90s screen-saver mazes. The approach peaks with centerpiece “Fast Forward,” where jittery synth leads wrap around each other like a hissing Medusa head of countermelodies and surging textures. The melodies decay and detune in real time, highlighting Shepherd’s handiwork—electronic music you can practically hear breathing, growing, and dying. “Afflecks Palace” takes this idea and throws a swirl of conflicting emotions at it. A nostalgic trip through early IDM, acid house, and jungle, it’s wiry and unpredictable, held together with a thin thread thanks to Shepherd’s now considerable experience making this kind of stuff on the fly.",Electronic,8.0
17,"The singer-songwriter completed her new album after a brush with death, filling her airy folk-rock with poetic urgency, empathetic curiosity, and a renewed respect for life. New York singer-songwriter Allegra Krieger isn’t speaking in hypotheticals when she tethers two questions together in “One or the Other”: “What do you know about living? What do you know about dying?” Late at night last summer, while Krieger was fast asleep on the fifth floor of her Chinatown apartment, several lithium batteries combusted in the e-bike shop down below. She awoke to banging on her door and, through a disorienting haze of gray smoke, couldn’t unlock the fire escape. So she held her breath, sprinted down the main stairwell instead, and, as the flames spread upwards, slipped and fell. By the grace of a God she only partially believes in, a fireman spotted her and carried her outside; Krieger made it out alive. Her second floor neighbor, Nancy, did not.The bulk of Art of the Unseen Infinity Machine, Krieger’s fifth album, was finished before the building fire, but the stark perspective offered by her escape and the experience of being rehomed in a new neighborhood accelerated its final songwriting sessions. Looming over its 13 tracks of airy folk-rock are questions of impermanence, purpose, and gratitude. Though survivor’s guilt hangs heavy on “One or the Other,” Krieger walks away from the trauma with renewed respect for life. From the sunny harmonies of “Roosevelt Ave” to the love-soaked glee radiating from “I’m So Happy I Cannot Face Tomorrow,” the 28-year-old musician strolls around the city with wonderment in her songs; her ability to make that feeling contagious while still acknowledging life’s pitfalls is a reflection of her musical prowess.Her new album comes barely a year after her last, 2023’s I Keep My Feet on the Fragile Plane, and Krieger’s ability to beautifully retell—but not romanticize—her struggles so soon after they happen is partially a result of her waning faith. After finding purpose in the Catholicism on which she was raised, Krieger discovered a similarly rewarding community in the music world and began to drift from her religion. Like gripping a rosary in her palm during prayer, Krieger’s songwriting on Art of the Unseen Infinity Machine uses physicality to expel pain through repetition and confession: the spindly guitar that prods rhythmically in “Into Eternity,” creaks of solemn piano during the album’s wordless interlude, a fuzz pedal dampening the guitar runs in “How Do You Sleep” as she sings of shame. The louder her blend of folk and indie rock gets, the darker its overall effect becomes.Enrolling in odd jobs around the country as a young adult—farming in North Carolina, staffing a roadside motel in California, planting trees in Georgia—taught her to appreciate time off spent reading. A disciple of Anne Carson and Clarice Lispector, Krieger sings with the poetic cadence and mysterious edge of those she admires. She wrestles with detachment in “Never Arriving,” keeping specifics just at bay enough for the song to be about sex, or technology, or desensitization. Even when she breaks into a Wednesday-worthy scream during the lusty “Came,” she pins up her lyrics with elegant descriptions of midnight humidity and gas station alcohol.",Folk,7.5
18,"Through tranquil reverberations of vibraphone and shō, the Japanese experimental composer contemplates the restless urges that inspire birds (and humans) to take flight. Birds possess a geographic intuition to make any cartographer weep. Year after year, migratory species travel thousands of miles, returning to the same nests with near-centimeter precision. Scientists believe our feathered friends are blessed with a specialized magnetoreceptor capable of reading Earth’s electromagnetic fields like a compass—fields so weak they couldn’t stick a magnet to your fridge.Masayoshi Fujita’s vibraphone is an equally uncanny organ, subtle and precise. Across Migratory his metallophone swells and swoops as if it too would like to ride the squalls and siroccos. Alternating between percussive spirals and languorous sound baths, Migratory refuses to flatten into ambient wallpaper, directing your ear to landmarks hundreds of miles underwing. “Desonata” twinkles and undulates like a softly expanding galaxy; “Pale Purple” plinks syncopated countermelodies against a wall of bowed dirges. These songs are deliberate but not meditative, more interested in depiction than reflection.Fujita guides listeners through lush and sparse terrain, equally likely to illustrate a placid lake or a sun-soaked field as a jagged mountain or arid badlands. Sometimes these landscapes can be shrouded, indistinct: “Distant Planet” traces a spare melody but feels almost too empty. At the other extreme, Moor Mother’s spoken-word performance on “Our Mother’s Lights” gilds the lily, stuffing one idea too many into the album’s most dynamic track; the texture of her ad-libs doesn’t quite make up for an anticlimactic stretch of free-associative writing.Despite the minor misfires, Migratory carves out its own contemplative niche, widening the scope of Fujita’s work through careful layering. Take “Higurashi,” featuring Hokkaido-via-London vocalist and composer Hatis Noit, which opens with a field recording of the titular cicadas. So closely does Noit’s tender vocal seem to mimic the rich tones of the vibraphone that, for the first two minutes, you nearly forget that Fujita hasn’t hit a note. When he finally enters, quiet as rustling leaves, it feels like a gentle exhale.Closer to earth, Mattias Hållsten teases out free reed disharmonies with the shō on three tracks including “Yodaka,” and Fujita’s father contributes saxophone. Fujita senior’s evocative brass undergirds Fujita junior’s headier ideas, stabilizing the fluttery “Blue Rock Thrush” and tethering “In a Sunny Meadow” via mournful topline. The collaborations widen Fujita’s palette, adding contrast and depth of field to his vibraphonic vistas.On one level, Migratory is a snapshot of Masayoshi Fujita’s own repatriation: After 13 years living in Berlin, the artist returned to his native Japan in 2020, living and recording amid the coastal hills of Kami-cho, Hyōgo. But on another, the album taps into an animal zugunruhe, that innate feeling telling us to spread our wings and go. Migratory balances this restlessness with an equanimous serenity unruffled by the gales, confident that Fujita’s scrupulous hand will catch the next updraft.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

19,"The German composer reflects on his many years of music-making with a subtle, melancholic suite of songs that looks back to move forward. Over the last two decades, Max Richter has perfected the art of writing lovely and intimate instrumental music, indebted to Brian Eno, Philip Glass, and Romantic era classical alike. Since the release of his debut Memoryhouse in 2002 and the landmark The Blue Notebooks in 2004, the German-born composer’s brand of tonal, postminimalist composition has dominated the classical scene, with labels like New Amsterdam Records and Bedroom Community championing and furthering the crossover classical ethos. For his part, Richter has basically become a popstar, claiming more than a billion streams to his name and a slew of big-ticket film and television scores.Now, he’s reflecting on these years of music making, looking back to move forward. Released 20 years after The Blue Notebooks, In a Landscape returns Richter to the themes that have made his career with a heavy dose of nostalgia. And while his compositional style functions like a well-oiled machine, In a Landscape shows that there’s still room to evolve by exploring the darkness that churns within his gentle music.Max Richter on the Music That Made HimThough on its surface Richter’s music is nearly too pretty, it has often been used to soundtrack the ills of society. His film and television scores have served as the backdrop to shows like Black Mirror, while he wrote The Blue Notebooks in protest of the Iraq War. With In a Landscape, he alludes to the polarity of our time and how his lovely music may offer some solace, or space, to contemplate it. But where his other music never strays too far from lightness, here he explores the more melancholy side of his practice, unearthing the uncertainty hiding behind even the most pleasant moments.Throughout, Richter’s melodies slope into downtrodden chords to create a darkened atmosphere. He often starts his compositions with simple phrases of just a few notes that glide down, moving at a leisurely andante and in uneven, unsteady steps. He shrouds each of these plodding phrases with a hint of reverb and ends most of his pieces on a solemn minor chord, languishing in each note. Take opener “They Will Shade Us With Their Wings,” for example, which features a melody in which the second note is accented, not the first, like a long, tired sigh after a sharp breath.This structure gives Richter’s music its pensiveness. “A Colour Field (Holocene)” blossoms from a five-note phrase whose off-kilter motion builds tension with each repetition, creating a hint of dissonance while maintaining his music’s signature charm. “The Poetry of Earth (Geophony)” grows from a couplet of four-note piano melodies, gradually adding in romantic strings that burst and swirl around them. Between these compositions lie recordings of everyday life, like the ambiance of cafes, footsteps, or birds. Though nothing new in the world of field recordings, in the context of In a Landscape, they offer a poignant break to remember the small moments that have already passed.Because Richter’s formula is so honed, it can become difficult to differentiate each piece as the album progresses. Was that the same baroque melody that appeared on “And Some Will Fall,” just transposed? Richter’s approach is almost too cut-and-dry; there’s none of the messiness that comes with processing emotion or the tension and release that defines catharsis. But closer “Movement, Before all Flowers” offers a welcome surprise. The song appears with airiness, turning the album’s leaden minor chords into something buoyant. A cello soars above oscillating piano like a shining light pointing the way back to shore. It’s Richter’s music at its most hopeful, emerging from the wreckage into something even more beautiful.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

20,"The UK’s latest post-punk export has built its rep on antic live shows and costumed hijinks. But on record, Fat Dog’s arch dance-punk fusion feels more calculated than provocatively chaotic. When Fat Dog, the UK’s latest post-punk export, hopped on tour with Viagra Boys last year, they enraged a few fans riding hard for the headliner. “We got a lot of hate from people because they didn’t want to see the support act ‘out-do’ anyone,” Fat Dog frontman Joe Love explained to NME this spring. Fuming that the South London five-piece were punching above their weight, one dissatisfied concertgoer accused Love of being “arrogant,” calling him “a tiny little prick,” as Fat Dog keyboardist Chris Hughes remembered.I’ve never seen Fat Dog live, but their reputation as performers has made its way into every published piece on the band. It’s what attracted their devoted following (who reportedly call themselves “the Kennel”), and landed them a record deal with Domino even before releasing their first single. Loyal to their rabid fanbase, Fat Dog let the Kennel select the initial track they recorded for Domino: a seven-minute thumper called “King of the Slugs” that came out last summer. Like most of the songs on Fat Dog’s debut album, WOOF., “King of the Slugs” is a hybrid strain of hard rock and EDM, blown-out bass and revving synths lurching into tweaked klezmer-techno. Often filtered through reverb, Love’s blunt and grizzled vocals recall bullish forebears like Idles and Fat White Family.In April, Fat Dog played “King of the Slugs” to a packed house at Electric Brixton, a 1,500 capacity venue in South London—the same part of town that’s birthed post-punk revivalists like Shame, Dry Cleaning, and Goat Girl in recent years. Footage from the show captures the crowd pogoing in unison as Love waves a white cowboy hat over them like a rodeo preacher. Behind him, drummer John Hutchinson sweats beneath his rubber dog mask, its jaw agape and tongue spilling out the front. Much fanfare has been made of the costumes and hijinks, and the audience is going batshit—but Love seems a bit joyless and contained, like he doesn’t quite believe in the product he’s peddling. That same sense of detachment is smudged across WOOF., mucking up the surface with its dull, grayish residue.Bemoaning rock’s cerebral turn, Love formed Fat Dog in 2021 with a batch of demos he’d made during lockdown. The band’s mandate: to make fun, ridiculous music. Something people could dance or thrash to. Hughes, Hutchinson, bassist Ben Harris, and woodwind player Morgan Wallace helped shape Love’s source material into zany bruisers with punk heft and club tempos. But despite the flatulent sax bursts and Love’s occasionally jagged howl, WOOF. feels decidedly un-fun, more like a series of cynical decisions looped on repeat.",Rock,5.7
21,"The London-based musician’s potent and intuitive second album dissolves the binaries inherent in ambient jazz and imagines a third sort of music that thrives at their midpoint. Endlessness, Nala Sinephro’s second record, centers on an arpeggio. The London-based composer modulates this ascendant phrase, extends it, plays it more lento, and lets it slip into inaudibility and disappear. It carries us like a rip tide through the album’s 10 tracks, all called “Continuum”—a perfect name for each, though this LP isn’t a series of variations on a single composition. Listen closely, and its details transform at a relentless clip. Let your mind drift, and its 45 minutes resemble a lake: broad, serene, consistent if never flat.The 28-year-old, raised on the outskirts of Brussels by a Belgian mother and a father with roots in Martinique and Guadeloupe, has both ambient music’s cool breeze and jazz’s strong winds at her back. She emerged as the union of these genres was finally losing its hyphen, during the COVID-marooned days of 2021. Floating Points and Pharoah Sanders’ Promises arrived in March, an event that paired the electronic perfectionist on the same bill as the elder-statesman saxophonist, along with the London Symphony Orchestra. Sinephro’s sparkling debut, Space 1.8, dropped in September of the same year, as though she knew a mantle was waiting to be taken up. She had recorded the disc in 2018 and 2019, but that only made her arrival more uncanny—when was the last time that a couple of jazz records, put out mere months apart, seemed to be talking to each other, disagreeing, finding common ground, and cogitating over a future for the form?Still, Sinephro scopes out the frontier. Endlessness dissolves the binaries that define ambient jazz and imagines a third sort of music that thrives at their midpoint. Its seamlessness distinguishes Sinephro’s second album from its still excellent predecessor, which was alternately atmospheric and bluesy. This is more cohesive, more elegant. Endlessness merges sensibilities with the naturalness of DNA strands bonding into a double helix. It both proves ambient jazz’s endurance and renders the two terms mutually redundant.Sinephro has grown considerably as a studio brain and bandleader in the last five years. She produced and mixed every song on Endlessness, engineering them with collaborator Rick David. She also arranged all of the record’s strings—never saccharine or maudlin, they feel poignant and as judicious as any other instrumental feature. Sinephro plays harp, piano, and synths both modular and otherwise alongside a who’s who of friends from South London’s jazz scene. Endlessness’ soul is the energy of the session, the ability of musicians in a room to swap ideas in real time.",Jazz,8.5
22,"On its second album, the Los Angeles band levels up its dizzying dynamic shifts and emphasizes Emma Maatman’s expressive voice. The result is a record of expertly crafted psych-pop that’s thrillingly kinetic and unbound. In thermodynamics, “free energy” is a measure of available power and spontaneity, how much potential heat and spark can be unleashed in the space of a reaction. Even if it might initially give you some pause to take a physics lesson from a group called Dummy, it’s an apt metaphor for the creative alchemy on the Los Angeles band’s second full-length album. Hard-won originality and explosive release are central to the group’s appeal; its songs are endlessly evocative yet utterly distinct. On Free Energy, Dummy have distilled their influences into music that’s as free-floating and airy as it is scorchingly combustible, weaving pummeling shoegaze guitar, dissonant electronics, and serene pockets of jazzy ambience into expertly crafted psych-pop.Dummy’s wide-ranging sound reflects a rigorous study and synthesis of their wildly eclectic forebears: My Bloody Valentine by way of Laraaji, Stereolab by way of The Byrds. Even at their most joyfully immediate, Dummy take a perverse glee in emphasizing just how easy their music isn’t: “Making music shouldn’t be fun” is the group’s long-time Bandcamp bio, never mind that they called their debut Mandatory Enjoyment. This deadpan-dourness is both a long-running joke and a reminder that the originality the band yields is no accident but a product of highly disciplined work. Where the greatness of Mandatory Enjoyment was in how successfully the group collaged its influences, on Free Energy, Dummy succeeds in burning away those raw edges altogether, resulting in an unbound sound that’s unmistakably their own.Free Energy is a record of altered states made incredibly fun and navigable. Dummy’s songwriting is cryptic and fragmentary, grappling from moment to moment with turbulent emotions as they blaze to the fore. There’s traces of the same meta cleverness that defined their last LP, especially on “Unshaped Road” which dramatizes the thrill and exhaustion of indie rockers: “Empty pockets feel pure…Feeling the weight/Begging for more each day/Come find me/Haven’t had enough yet.” But more often, the songs are multicolor free-falls into dreamy or unsettling landscapes. Many of the titles are drawn (Grimes-like) from advanced physics and niche video game references, which give the impression of cohesive, if bizarro, world-building. “Minus World,” for instance, is a study of dawning panic that, if looked at sideways, also doubles as a first person-account of being stranded in the infamous Super Mario Bros..This dislocation is reinforced by the thrilling instability of the music itself. “Unshaped Road” pulls a production trick worthy of Kevin Shields, building the song out over a bruising bass tone that gradually tilts off its axis until the only accompaniment to Alex Ewell’s athletic drumming is a squall of roaring feedback. In “Nullspace,” Joe Trainor’s hard-driving guitar riff is made to surf over rubbery synths that sound like a cartoon character perpetually slipping on an oil slick. Like a hypnotist’s cue, the recurrence of a pinging synth loop on “Soonish…” prompts the band to rage and recede on cue.",Rock,8.0
23,"Chaz Bear has been on the periphery of emo-rap since 24kGoldn was in kindergarten. But the crowded, blown-out Hole Erth struggles to sound like anything but an imitation. Chillwave may have come and gone, but its woozy footprints are everywhere: lofi hip-hop beats, Tame Impala’s continued dominance as a festival headliner, the endless barrage of shapeless AI synth tracks floating through Spotify like a garbage island in the Pacific. Disconnected from the actual talent of its OG practitioners, the scene that Chaz Bear (né Bundick) came up through as Toro y Moi has found real staying power in the current ecosystem of inoffensive, ambiguously jazz/funk/ambient sounds engineered for Maximum Vibe Wattage.Any indie act who’s stuck around as long as Toro y Moi must adapt, and in addition to dipping his toe into disco and indie rock and ambient, Bear has expanded to working with mainstream collaborators like Flume and Travis Scott. His new Toro y Moi project, Hole Erth, is a reference to the esoteric counterculture magazine Whole Earth Catalog, which Steve Jobs once referred to as a “paperback Google.” But while the hip-hop and pop-punk inspirations that Bear draws on for this album may have dominated the mid-2000s culture he came up in, they arrive on Hole Erth having already overstayed their welcome. Unlike his 2015 Samantha mixtape, where Bear experimented with R&B samples and features from Kool A.D. and Rome Fortune to arrive at a unique atmospheric sound, Hole Erth struggles to sound like anything but an imitation.It’s hard to fault Bear for trying out emo-rap when he’s been on the periphery of both since 24kGoldn was in kindergarten. But therein lies the problem: He’s now 37, sounding every bit his age as he adopts the cadence of music made almost exclusively by and for people younger than iTunes. It doesn’t help that many of his hip-hop nods resemble zeitgeist-y sounds from five years ago. “We back like bad teenagers,” Bear proclaims on “Walking in the Rain,” a would-be Astroworld leftover complete with hyperspace synths and Auto-Tuned interjections. “Off Road” sounds like a Roddy Ricch song about being stuck in traffic; the droning guitar and sludgy vocals on half the album are indebted to Lil Peep, minus the pathos and dread that made him compelling. Even when Bear brings on indie contemporary Ben Gibbard for “Hollywood,” he boxes the Death Cab for Cutie vocalist into a trap beat that combines with his airy tone like oil and water.The last time Bear positioned himself as a storyteller, on 2017’s Boo, the results were ho-hum. As he tackles two notoriously lyric-heavy genres on Hole Erth, his weaknesses stick out more than ever. On stripper anthem “Babydaddy,” the best he can do is rhyme “UGA” with “MBA.” Elsewhere, he fills choruses with nice-sounding platitudes—“I was stone rolling, I was role playing, I was wind blowing”—that would be fine as window dressing, but come off as rambling when placed front-and-center in the mix. The two exceptions are “CD-R” and “Tuesday,” transmissions from Bear’s early days as an upstart musician with a refreshingly snotty attitude toward celebrity. “Blackberry days, I would talk to anyone,” he sings over a beat that sounds like it was extracted from a Y2K software package. It works a lot better than his extensive quoting of “Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old Girl” on “Heaven,” or the gratuitous Tom Petty reference propping up “Reseda.”",Electronic,5.7
24,"The Norwegian-American songwriter’s observations about contemporary states of distraction and detachment are compassionate and closely focused. If you thought Okay Kaya was taking liberties to question Dolly Parton on her last record, 2022’s SAP, then gird yourself for the targets on Kaya Wilkins’ fourth LP. “Picture This” begins by asking the listener to imagine themselves as “Sisyphus as a health-nut geologist” who is, once and for all, going to push that damn rock to the top. And the rock doesn’t like it one bit! “Who is this man with his clammy hands/And why is he defying/Gravity?” she sings from the once-victorious stone’s perspective. The 34-year-old Norwegian-American musician is here to rewrite the Greek myths, one nimble flip turning a 3000-year-old story into a neat wink about the fantasy of seizing control of one’s life; of conquering not just your health, but nature and fate. Better still, Wilkins doesn’t draw attention to how genuinely funny the lyrics are (“You want to be like your daddy/A rolling stone/Gain some speed and lose control,” she consoles the rock), instead all but smothering her run-on verses—sung in a head voice that suggests she’s low on oxygen—in languid, Moon Safari-worthy stardust.If Camus wrote that we must imagine the perpetually failing Sisyphus as happy, Wilkins’ unburdened hero has to be experiencing some degree of delusion. Smaller, similarly blinkered battles between man and nature play out across Oh My God - That’s So Me. The title phrase comes from the last song, the folky hymnal “The Art of Poetry,” in which someone looks at the moon and, “struck by familiarity,” utters it out loud. To fluttery woodwinds and loudening strings, Wilkins repeats the phrase over and over, seemingly captivated and a little horrified by the banality of seeing nature as nothing more than a mirror and a meme. Written and self-recorded on her new home on an island off Oslo only accessible by boat, Oh My God comes from a physical place of detachment, but puts a more organic spin on Wilkins’ usual lyrical Verfremdungseffekt. No longer does she leave lacerating lines suspended in mid-air, like a knife dangling off the edge of a table; her observations about contemporary states of distraction and detachment come wreathed in compassion and close focus.Without in any way lecturing about getting back to the land, there is the sense here that, somewhere along the line, humankind’s priorities have gone askew. No matter: They might yet be gently danced back onto the right track. In sublime standout “The Groke,” Wilkins coins her own myth of a stalking, wintry menace who’s either a sort of SAD selkie or the personification of the climate crisis—you decide—and writes her a theme tune: Miles-funky woodwind and woodblocks, strings with cartoonishly sharp verve, a chorus line intoning the hellhound’s name with a camp severity that implies you’d better watch your back. (While it doesn’t sound like U.S. Girls’ “4 American Dollars,” it nails the throwback brief just as expertly.)",Pop,8.0
25,"Finally reissued in full, the 1996 debut from Wolfgang Voigt’s ambient techno project deserves every second of its 92-minute runtime. It’s music to get lost in, meditative and mind-numbing—in the best way. Since 1997’s Zauberberg, the ambient techno albums under Wolfgang Voigt’s GAS alias have formed an aesthetically complete unit held together by psychedelically blurred forest artwork and a deep-rooted awe of the universe’s terrifying vastness. Yet the Cologne producer seemed to have trouble reconciling that opus with the project’s self-titled 1996 debut. The Nah und Fern comp, released in 2008, swapped out two of the debut album’s tracks for new ones more of a piece with the later records; 2016’s Box set omitted the 1996 LP entirely. Voigt seems to think of it as an outlier in the GAS catalog, which in a few crucial respects it is. The cover is an indistinct yellow blotch reminiscent of Bathory’s Gula Geten, and the soundscape is more given to billowing walls of shoegaze than the ghostly vinyl crackle he introduced on Zauberberg.A new reissue on Kompakt lets GAS stand on its own, giving it room to breathe and sprawl. This is the first reissue of the album’s original, pre-Nah und Fern incarnation since its initial release on Mille Plateaux, and its most immediately striking quality is its sheer size. While the Nah und Fern version runs a little over an hour, the original CD version nearly maxed out the format’s capacity. The 3xLP runs a whopping 92 minutes, its six tracks averaging a hair past 15 minutes apiece, each one stretching comfortably across an entire side of an LP. (The digital download also features all six tracks in their full-length versions.) Voigt might see GAS as a test run for later brilliance, but it’s hard to argue it’s a minor work when in scale alone it so thoroughly dwarfs its kin—a Jupiter among Earths.Many of the hallmarks of the GAS project are already here, not least the shimmering backwards guitar that courses through 1998’s sad, autumnal Königsforst and which makes its first appearance on “GAS 2” as it endlessly circles a major-chord resolution. Voigt’s trademark kick drum thumps as forebodingly as ever, accompanied by a hi-hat that would largely disappear from the later recordings. And like Zauberberg, it begins and ends with beatless drifts before the kick arrives to ferry us deeper into the album.What really sets it apart from the later GAS albums is that the forest imagery has not yet developed. Voigt drew the inspiration for the later albums from a complex and personal tangle of associations, centered on his youthful acid trips in Germany’s Königsforst and a desire to tie the “deep soul of German techno” to some even deeper truth contained within the land itself. On Zauberberg, the vinyl crackles reach out of the mix like grasping branches, while stirring orchestral samples sourced from German Romantic music convey deep unease. It’s music of the earth, flecked by dirt and decayed by time.",Electronic,8.3
26,"On their first album of original material in nine years, the veteran New York rockers reinvent themselves once again. That’s where the problems begin. Let’s raise a glass to the big swing, and let’s pour some out for missed targets. Mercury Rev’s first studio album of original material in nine years is that rare thing: a work that doubles, even quadruples down on a weird idea, defying marketability or even legibility. The band wrote and recorded Born Horses, mixed and mastered it, then released it, all of which constitutes brash commitment to the bit. There’s something admirable in the fact that it exists, for these are the materials from which cults are built—not the white-robes-and-passing-comets variety but the kind that rescues lost objects and redefines them as precious. Is Born Horses fated to become a cult obsession?This is the second time they’ve taken such a risk. After the commercial failure of their third album, 1995’s See You on the Other Side, Mercury Rev effectively broke up and reunited as a very different band under the same name. Jettisoning the punk-derived riffs and blasts of distortion that had defined their music, they adopted a weird pastoralia, indulging whims both folksy and cinematic, earthy and magical; Deserter’s Songs, their unexpected comeback, sounded like a transmission from a haunted forest. It was a huge, potentially alienating gamble, but it paid off beautifully and revitalized the band for the new millennium. Perhaps that’s what Jonathan Donahue and Sean “Grasshopper” Mackowiak hoped to achieve when they made Born Horses, which attempts a much less dramatic transformation and fails spectacularly.It began when Donahue stepped up to the microphone and started singing. Instead of the high, hollow rasp that has become his trademark since Deserter’s Songs, what came out of his mouth was deeper and throatier—something closer to speaking than singing. They wrote new songs to that new sound, penning lyrics that self-consciously come across like poetry to be recited. The band has cited composer Tony Conrad, poet Robert Creeley, and the Blade Runner as inspirations, but Born Horses sounds more like The Two Sides of Leonard Nimoy or the albums of Rod McKuen, the pop-poet of the 1960s and ’70s who was the Thomas Kinkade of his medium. This unusual palette is startling at first, and potentially compelling as a hook upon which to hang an album. It could be something that jolts pop music in a different direction, or at least expands indie rock to incorporate a new set of reference points. But it doesn’t.Weirdly, these songs aren’t quite weird enough. Mercury Rev have never been shy about embracing kitsch, but Born Horses reins in some of their more eccentric impulses, even as it indulges new musical ones. Every song is about just what its title says it’s about. “Mood Swings” is about how Donahue has mood swings. On “Patterns” he notices patterns in everyday life, and isn’t that something? On “Ancient Love” he celebrates a love so old that it’s ancient. Throughout Born Horses, Donahue repeatedly presents himself as a bird. He knows why the caged bird sings. There’s a bird that lives in his chest. Every song sounds like a first draft, juvenile and solipsistic where it’s supposed to be open-hearted and gracious. You long for an inscrutable turn of phrase or a nugget of truly bizarre imagery, anything to disrupt the constant outpouring of Trapper Keeper poetry.",Rock,4.5
27,"Split between libido-maxxed hooks and hackneyed stabs at post-bender profundity, the Dare’s debut album is sweaty, horny, and trying really hard. The Dare’s mission is to bring back sleaze and sex, but so far his music has felt mostly like a LARP. The deliciously carnal “Girls” kickstarted Harrison Patrick Smith’s one-man electroclash revival, turning him overnight into a glossy magazine It Boy and a punching bag for critics exhausted by Dimes Square scenesters. But last year’s half-baked Sex failed to build on the hype. Now, after a bump in visibility for his production on Charli xcx’s tight and slinky “Guess,” the Dare’s debut album arrives in the form of a musical manifesto. The title, What’s Wrong With New York?, is a rhetorical question. The Dare, with his used-car-salesman blazer, thunderous bass, and horny dance-punk swagger, is here to rescue the city from its sexless pandemic slumber and Make New York Depraved Again.At 10 tracks, What’s Wrong With New York? doubles the Dare’s catalog while doubling down on everything that’s made his music so queasy. It’s even more redolent of LCD Soundsystem, but with a slimy, trashy edge; imagine James Murphy training as a pick-up artist. It oozes with desperation to sound edgy and cool like NYC rockers of myth. The Dare has spoken about wanting to bring back dissolution, to restore offensive fun to dance-rock. That could thrill if done right, and in certain electrifying moments, the Dare get close. But the album largely hits like a contact high, a simulation of a chaotic night out. It’s like BRAT for fashion consultants who brag about getting listed.What’s Wrong With New York? is split between typical Dare fare—libido-maxxed hooks, throaty groans—and hackneyed stabs at tender, post-bender profundity. He recycles the two best tracks from his EP, “Girls” and “Good Time,” which hurls voluptuous synth bass and garish hoots into a power surge of tipsy electricity. “Movement” cranks the adrenaline to peak monstrosity, like Fischerspooner’s “Emerge” rewired for body-bashing dancefloor freakouts. Highlight “I Destroyed Disco” is even more unforgiving, evoking Justice distorto-blare. It has some of Smith’s most hubristic lyrics—“I break records, glasses, faces, kick the whole world in the teeth with my untied laces”—but they work because he commits to the bit. Dark bass thuds like depth charge detonations and climaxes in a shockwave of bleeps. File under electro-crash.Most often, this music conjures only the vague sense that you might’ve heard it before, in a more striking rendition, by a more innovative band. “All Night” has catchy chants but it mostly feels like a lairy, drunken take on early MGMT. The insipid “You’re Invited”—in which he repeats “You’re invited” over a Rapture inspo beat—sounds like the tagline for the app that’s going to disrupt the private event industry. The video for the characterless “Perfume” indeed seems to be a fake commercial, packed with slender models in monochrome.",Pop,6.2
28,"A few years removed from TikTok virality, the Belarusian band sharpens its blend of ’80s goth rock and post-Soviet melancholia. The new album is more ebullient and captivating, though the energy can sometimes lag. Four years ago, the Belarusian post-punk band Molchat Doma went viral on TikTok, and their take on post-Soviet melancholy became the soundtrack to moody videos made across the globe. Since then, Russia has accelerated its ongoing attacks on Ukraine, and the members of Molchat Doma have had to leave home. Now they live among Los Angeles’ palm trees, far from the oxidizing Eastern bloc with which they’ve been so closely associated—but their melancholy remains. On Belaya Polosa, their fourth album (and first since 2020), Molchat Doma continues to channel ’80s goth-rock sounds in service of their particular brand of gloom, bringing more ebullient, confident instrumentation into the mix.While Monument, Molchat Doma’s last album, was dominated by leaden Bauhaus guitars, Belaya Polosa whirrs with Tangerine Dream’s industrial batwings; most of the album is propelled by frantic drum machines and synths. Like dogs waiting to be fed, these pulsing sounds scramble over and into each other, and the effect is captivating. “Ты Же Не Знаешь Кто Я / Ty Zhe Ne Znaesh Kto Ya” hisses for a full minute before vocalist Egor Shkutko enters its frenzy, and the darkness of his voice pulls you deeper into cool hypnosis. Then it wavers, as if it were disappearing in acid: “You can’t hear me, you can’t imagine who I am,” Shkutko sings in Russian.Belaya Polosa luxuriates in restlessness. Lyrics describe days without sleep, how winter is unrelenting, and why love, if it even exists, sits too far away. Throughout, Shkutko wails: on “Черные Цветы / Chernye Cvety,” singing of disillusionment over a silky Cocteau Twins groove; on “Не Вдвоëм / Ne Vdvoem,” a yacht rock song for goths; on “Колесом / Kolesom,” while he’s being barraged by synth hail. The album’s indulgent hopelessness is best encapsulated by the image of the passive, watching moon in “Зимняя / Zimnyaya,” a song whose effervescent melody spills bitterly, like old champagne.But for how morose it is, Belaya Polosa also twitches with agitated energy. Its best moments are its firework flashes, the synth sparkles and bass booms on songs like “Белая Полоса / Belaya Polosa,” which prop up Shkutko’s continually sinking feelings. “Я Так Устал / Ya Tak Ustal” likewise features a delightfully maximalist synth whine, circling Shkutko’s desperation like a hopeful ring of sunlight. But moments when that energy falters—like on the torpid intermission, “Безнадежный Вальс / Beznadezhniy Waltz,” or when you realize you’re listening to the same drum tone for the fifth song in a row—drag the album down to melodramatic lows.",Rock,7.1
29,"The Southern California band once printed up a T-shirt proclaiming, “Shoegaze is a prison.” On their second album, they break out. Cold Gawd have often dreamed of escape. The Southern California band’s singer and primary songwriter, Matthew Wainwright, has said that his lyrics on their 2022 album God Get Me the Fuck Out of Here came from a place of intense existential discomfort—that after a lifetime of ignoring his issues with himself and the world around him, he felt trapped in “bad habits and old ways of thinking.” Desperation haunts the record’s dense thickets of nervy distortion and anguished whispers; it’s right there in the title’s prayer for deliverance. They wanted out at any cost.I’ll Drown on This Earth, the band’s second full-length, opens with a scream that suggests the intervening years haven’t been much easier. Pained and phlegmatic, the opening moments of “Gorgeous” give way to a static-scoured ballad of what-ifs and could’ve-beens, with Wainwright murmuring about being born again into a better life that feels just out of reach. It only becomes more intense over the five and a half minutes that ensue, roiling and swelling into a crushing climax that recalls the stormy post-metal catharsis of bands like Envy and Deafheaven.Sickly, overwhelming, and downcast, this is familiar territory for Cold Gawd, but it’s also one of only a few songs that hew so closely to the sludge-splashed shoegaze they’ve become known for over the past few years. They’ve often expressed feeling hemmed in by the genre—as one of their T-shirts memorably puts it: “Shoegaze is a prison.” And while I’ll Drown on This Earth does use tracks like “Gorgeous” to demonstrate their intimate knowledge of the sound’s grand scale and gloomy sonics, they’re also clearly eager to push beyond it. Wainwright has said he intended this record to be more than just “another ‘woe is me’ sort of thing.” Instead, he wrote of tenderness and intimacy, the dawning of new desire, and the mutual dependence that blooms out of lasting love.Though the scuzzy murk of Cold Gawd’s older songs is still present, it’s illuminated by a newfound serenity in the smeary synth pads of ““Nudism”” and other similarly contemplative songs. As Wainwright sings of a figure that visits him only in dreams, the track burbles and laps in a way that feels pensive and surreal, a rare quiet moment for a troubled mind. “Tappan” is similarly reflective; the sleepwalking, loop-laden ballad recalls the tape-melted haze of Toro y Moi’s earliest experiments more than it does any of the punkish brutalism that informed their foundational work. Guitars stutter nervously underneath washes of spectral ambiance, distinct parts blurring together in foggy bokeh. Amid the fog, Wainwright whispers a vision of love: “I saw heaven in instances of you.”",Rock,7.0
30,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit the Pogues’ 1985 classic, a groundbreaking punk-rock fever-dream pub session led by Shane MacGowan’s unforgettable writing and performance. When Shane MacGowan died last year, it felt like the passing of a head of state. In a sense it was: The Irish president attended the funeral; a pre-recorded Bono read from St. Paul’s Letter to the Corinthians; Nick Cave sang a moving “Rainy Night in Soho.” And by the time the assembly was laying into an unexpurgated reading of “Fairytale of New York”—a white-bearded Glen Hansard leading the congregation, with neo-trad ambassador Lisa O’Neill singing Kirsty MacColl’s parts, Spider Stacey and other Pogues accompanying them on instruments as MacGowan’s widow and others waltzed near the altar—it’s a fair bet many of those present, not to mention those watching the livestream, were blinking back tears. (I certainly was.) Even the pious outcries that followed this unconventional mass felt perfect—one imagined MacGowan’s jagged grin shining down from heaven.Why such reverence? For one thing, MacGowan and the Pogues made Irish roots music cool. Sure, music nerds admired the native folk revivalists of the 1970s like Planxty and Clannad, the family band that briefly worked with kosmische legend Conny Plank and launched the career of sister Enya before finding their own crossover fame. Some American country artists appreciated the Irish influence on, and dialogue with, their own music. And Bob Dylan covered his share of Irish-rooted tunes; among others, a handsome take on “The Auld Triangle” turned up among the Basement Tapes.As punk bubbled up at CBGB and Max’s in the Irish diaspora of New York City, you could still hear the ’60s folk-revival sounds of Ed Sullivan faves the Clancy Brothers and the Dubliners in countless Irish bars. But these were better known as hangouts for pensioners and off-duty cops than destinations for live music. By the time the Pogues ramped up in the early ’80s, pre-Riverdance and Van Morrison’s LP with the Chieftains, Irish trad was squarely stuff for family gatherings, if it was in your bloodline, trotted out with the green beer and public drunkenness on St. Paddy’s Day.But the Pogues went beyond revivalism. They built a canon of their own, much of it flowing from the golden pen and orthodontically imposing mouth of MacGowan, their frontman and main songwriter. You glimpsed his gift on their debut, Red Roses for Me. Roughly half standards, including “The Auld Triangle,” it also had MacGowan’s “Boys From the County Hell,” a rabid, myth-building anthem loaded with writerly turns:",Rock,9.5
31,"The multimedia artist’s latest release is a fictionalized retelling of Amelia Earhart’s final voyage. A brisk and largely frictionless record, it’s nonetheless filled with moments of awestruck wonder. Laurie Anderson’s debut album, 1982’s Big Science, opens with a plane crash. Ever since, aircraft have figured inauspiciously in her work. The jets ominously crisscrossing “O Superman” (“Here come the planes/They’re American planes,” she intones) took on an even more portentous cast when she performed the song shortly after 9/11. In 2017, Anderson created a virtual reality installation, Aloft, that simulates sitting in a plane that slowly dissolves, leaving the viewer suspended in midair. At least some of these pieces may be drawn from Anderson’s own experience: She once survived the wreck of a small commercial plane. “It took a long time, ten minutes, from the time the first engine started sputtering to crash,” she recently recalled. “It sounds like nothing at all, ten minutes, and yet when you’re in a situation like that and you can’t move, it feels like the longest time imaginable.”Anderson’s new album Amelia plays similar tricks with time, but in reverse, compressing the last 44 days of Amelia Earhart’s life into a breezy 35 minutes. A fictionalized retelling of the pilot’s ill-fated 1937 attempt to circumnavigate the globe, it is, essentially, the chronicle of a crash foretold. From the very first engine noises that open the album, growling like a World War II dogfight, we know exactly how this story will end: with the 39-year-old adventurer, technologist, and feminist pioneer disappearing somewhere over the Pacific, never to be found.Like 2018’s Landfall—a rumination on the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in collaboration with the Kronos Quartet—Amelia pairs Anderson’s hypnotic style of vocalizing with a contemporary classical ensemble (Filharmonie Brno, conducted by Dennis Russell Davies). But Amelia, despite its tragic final act, is a lighter and livelier reflection: a celebration of Earhart’s life and spirit, and an occasionally awestruck meditation on the magnitude of her quest.Anderson uses multiple perspectives to tell Earhart’s story. Flatly objective logbook data bleed into fictionalized journal entries (“It was the sound of the motor I remember the most”). Telegrams (“Fred unable to set his chronometers. Stop. Personal unfitness. Stop. Looking bad for arrival in Oakland July 4th stop. Stop.”) alternate with third-person narration delivered with the coolly objective tone of an encyclopedia entry. Anderson uses different vocal styles and registers to accommodate these overlapping perspectives, while ANOHNI, singing through a vocoder, gives voice to the waves and the wind.These fragmented scenes suggest the kaleidoscopic perspective of a text like Michael Ondaatje’s Coming Through Slaughter, but in its brevity and gliding pace, Amelia feels more like a PBS special; you can practically see the red line moving across the animated map, the tastefully reenacted cockpit vignettes, the sleek montage of newspaper headlines and newsreel footage. Anderson has said that an earlier version of the piece was overstuffed with instruments and ideas, but Amelia flits briskly from scene to scene, with just enough musical backing to flesh out the atmosphere: shimmering oceanic drones; subtly driving pulses; dissonant whorls abruptly smoothed into reassuring consonance. A handful of guest musicians, including jazz guitarist Marc Ribot, flesh out Anderson’s impressionistic soundscapes, but they’re so carefully integrated into the whole that you might never notice their individual presence. Despite brief moments of tumult, it is a largely frictionless listen.",Experimental,7.1
32,"The second act of the slowcore and space-rock band has now lasted longer than the first. On their third album since reuniting, they’re still playing the past. Cult status tends to flatten its subjects, rendering them as two-dimensional objects permanently sandwiched like fossils by the mounting strata of time and taste. Just consider so many of the private-press or new-age obscurities that returned to attention through the loving efforts of reissue labels and online enthusiasts during the past quarter century; so often, their veneration hinges more on their creators’ past work (and, frequently, its prescience) than who they have become or what they’re doing now. The implicit message? Be who you were, not are.For their part, and so far, Duster have navigated this position nobly. Since the wonderfully opaque and subdued California trio faded back into existence in 2018, when a rising tide of streaming numbers helped prompt an indispensable box set from Numero Group, Duster made two very good records, essentially doubling their commercial output in three years. They gently brightened and occasionally toughened their space-rock and slowcore hymns, once so fragile they seemed like very old skeletons. Like Stratosphere and Contemporary Movement before them, those new LPs felt like collections of bittersweet 45s the band remembered they had stashed in the basement, dust permanently lodged into the grooves. Duster sang about the present—desire and disappointment, brightness and ennui—amid slight updates on the sounds of their past. That’s sometimes the best bargain a band excavated from the crates can get.But Duster’s second phase has now lasted longer than their first; their cross-country run this fall marks nearly six years since they stepped back onstage. This feels like the time when Duster should move definitively beyond their legacy, or when the novelty of becoming a band salvaged by Spotify (and, later, TikTok) must give way for some definitive newness. Released without warning in late August, In Dreams makes no such gambit. Its 13 songs of love and disgust mostly hinge upon the cosmic drift and slow-motion amble that made their early work so enchanting and enduring. The scowl and sway of “Close to Home,” the gentle sweep of “Quiet Eyes,” the quiet roar of “Baking Tapes”: It is absolutely prime Duster, so spot-on it all suggests they may never actually expand upon what that phrase means. However enjoyable In Dreams is, it seems that Duster have forever accepted that two-dimensional version of themselves.The best moments on In Dreams are the ones that surprise you, that remind you that this is a new album and not another set of salvaged castoffs. “Like a Movie” is a nice-enough song, its simple riff sparkling beneath a patina of fingerprints and underlining its accusations like a wink. “What are you gonna tell all your friends?” Canaan Dove Amber sings, voice as faint as the flicker of a faraway lantern. “Just making up shit for kicks.” But then the band goes nearly silent, with muted pedal whirrs and repeating notes segueing into lonely strums of ragged chords. In a song about never going home, it’s as if Amber’s testing out the feeling of real loneliness, a deliberate pairing of form and function that is almost novel given Duster’s nonchalance.",Rock,7.1
33,"The Asheville singer-songwriter’s outstanding fourth album is loaded with zingers and losers. It’s witty and sincere, the mark of a songwriter finding his voice. In an MJ Lenderman song, the extraordinary is always elbowing its way into the mundane. His 2022 breakthrough album, Boat Songs, thrived on these situations. One minute someone was clinically depressed on the Six Flags log flume, the next they were locked in a spat about a “dumb hat” outside a butcher shop. “Being really sad or upset while wearing a costume,” he told Pitchfork last year, “that’s funny.” Over the last couple of years—as he signed with Anti- and remained a guitarist and songwriter in the great Southern indie rock band Wednesday, alongside his now ex-partner Karly Hartzman—Lenderman became a cult folk hero for people willing to talk about their feelings if they could couch it in a joke about Jackass.I had originally clocked Manning Fireworks as more of the same, where Lenderman relies on this one weird trick to write sincere but ultimately unserious songs. I was wrong. Lenderman has honed his songwriting such that I’d nominate a couplet for short story of the year: “Kahlúa shooter/DUI scooter.” He’s got lines that’ll paint a stupid grin on your face: “I could really use your two cents, babe/I could really use the change,” or, “Is it the quiet hiss of a midnight piss/Or a river turned to creek?” If his folk-rock forebears, like Neil Young and Jason Molina, were drawn to the mystics of the natural world, Lenderman is drawn to the mystics of the shitty apartment, simple and unvarnished songs born of small screens in small rooms in small towns.His writing style conjures the dark, dry wit of Warren Zevon. The men who populate Lenderman and Zevon’s songs are pure losers, divorcés, badgering or self-effacing romantics working on their last-ever heartbreak. Both artists also know how to open a song with a zinger: “Well I can saw a woman in two/But you won’t wanna look in the box when I am through,” Zevon once sang. It’s such a Lenderman line, especially if you imagine him singing it at half the speed Zevon does. “Burdened by those wet dreams/Of people having fun,” opens Lenderman, staring into the middle distance on the mid-tempo rocker “On My Knees.” This is, mind you, the second time he’s sung about cum on Manning Fireworks.Really, it’s unfair to say that Lenderman writes about cum and piss and cartoons and video games. He does, but it’s the style and economy in which he renders them, as if he’s brushing them in gold leaf. “Rudolph” opens with this:",Rock,8.7
34,"The very cool, very downtown New York dance trio’s debut EP is of little ambition, which isn’t to say it isn’t good. It’s a party and you’re not invited. It’s a room full of girls in little shirts with their sunglasses still on. A karaoke parlor that turns into a nightclub, and for some reason, the Cobrasnake is there. It’s the best $18 you’ve ever spent, you tell your friend, sipping your negroni, while she throws up into a sewer grate.Where would Fcukers be without Dimes Square? In an alternate universe, we’d ask: Does this band sound too much like Saint Etienne? But here we are. Fcukers, which is Benjamin Scharf, Jackson Walker Lewis, and Shanny Wise, are a downtown Manhattan band. They have risen because they are a part of a moment. They have signed to Technicolour, which is an imprint of Ninja Tune. They have been on the cover of NME, where Wise, the vocalist, had this to say about her experience DJing a Celine afterparty: “We wear baggy pants and don’t play rock’n’roll. I wear shark tees, I don’t know much about fashion.” This is the fantasy record companies are selling about New York right now: that if you are a girl with a dream and a 909 kick drum and are friends with that one Clandestino bartender who is also a producer, this too can be your life.Which is funny when you consider the music that Fcukers make. Their debut EP Baggy$$ is of little ambition, which is not a bad thing. It follows a pretty basic formula. A little distorted vocal or three-note melody as the bass rolls, add hi-hats, loop vocals, sweeten it. “Bon Bon,” the lead single, starts off with a snarl. It brings in a drum machine, then a synth sound that’s a little UK garage. Wise’s vocals are like sucking on a Ring Pop so you won’t grind your teeth from taking too much molly. She sounds like the girl from Aqua. She sounds like the girls, plural, from Ladytron. A Fcukers song, at its best, is a really sexy time. It makes you feel cool, however nebulous that term may be.But the scope of this world is limited. Fcukers are not doing anything particularly innovative; they’re not interested in it. A song like “Heart Dub” is not so different from a PinkPantheress track (if a little longer) but with a little more dancehall and dub. Wise performs the dangerous—but not impossible—task of kind of rapping over a Lady Saw–type beat. Looping a drum machine, making the synth sound bottom out like it cannonballed into a Jacuzzi. Having your other references be “Born Slippy” and Dummy, like they are on “I Don’t Wanna.” We’ve been here before, in the “unexpected” crossover between dub and velvety downtempo pop. There’s no risk. There’s no harm in it, either.",Electronic,6.8
35,"The Atlanta rapper’s new album ditches the dirge-like guitars of If Looks Could Kill, but despite the flashy trap beats and flex-rap tropes, he still makes hedonism sound dreary. Do you remember the days when Destroy Lonely drops felt like certified moments, when his vocals rippled across beats as regal and shimmery as stained glass? Now he’s tossing out barely baked tapes and getting caught up in Twitter beefs. Among Playboi Carti’s Opium label roster, the inventive and goofy Ken Carson increasingly overshadows him. Worst of all, an ex-girlfriend has accused him of physical assault—an allegation he’s denied. At a moment when stars are crashing out every week, Lone’s fall from grace feels particularly precipitous. His new album ditches the dirgelike guitar vibe of last year’s overlong debut, which triggered a tsunami of scorn. It feels like an attempt to reclaim his spot as a cult favorite.LOVE LASTS FOREVER is all flashy beats and sugary vocal sprees. But instead of reviving golden-era Lone, the tape is overloaded with flamboyant flex-rap tropes, as though he’d SparkNoted himself. No song is downright awful; equally, no lyric or hook or vocal run leaves much of an impression. Imagine a Travis Scott album with no features—it’s an airless vault full of the best brags ChatGPT can generate and anonymously elegant instrumentals that shine like knockoff jewelry.The emptiness is frustrating, because Lone clearly wants to create an immersive world for his music. His cover art is always sleekly designed. He directed a short film for his last project. He conceptualizes distinct personas for new albums, assigning himself a nickname for each. On If Looks Could Kill, he was Look Killa; now he’s Baby Money. Yet that’s about as far as his creativity extends—as a branding exercise to make himself appear cool, mysterious, and vaguely artsy. He has the Swiftian impulse to self-mythologize, but his storytelling misses the mark. There’s something almost impressive about the way Lone makes luxury and hedonism sound dreary through repetition. It’s an endless excess-athon of getting head, sipping drank, flying to L.A., popping fits, making million after million after million. Even the title—LOVE LASTS FOREVER—feels pointless, having nothing to do with 95 percent of the album. There are no lovesick croons, no yearning synth flutters, no romantic insights.The beats, almost exclusively produced by Lil 88, are richly textured yet hollow, like royalty-free trap beats gussied up with a blockbuster budget. Even after a dozen listens, you’d still strain to pick any of them out of a lineup. The few that stick in the memory are hypnotic and cosmically uneasy, like “LUV 4 YA,” which has the glacial breeze of an experimental bass tune. It’s one of only a handful that mutates as the track goes on, with drones and keys that mirror the drunken vocals in the bridge. Icy synth slivers tingle the brain on “LOVE HURTS,” which could soundtrack Lone and Lil Uzi Vert catwalking across Pluto in all-black Rick Owens space suits. When Lone boasts, “This ain’t a lifestyle, this just life,” over the madly lurching underworld merry-go-round of “SAY THAT,” you’re almost convinced he has control over the carnival. But then the power cuts out, and it’s back to type beats.When he feels like trying, swift flow shifts and the rare goofy bar liven things up. Yet even his more erratic and energized tonal spasms—the “woo woo” on “SYRUP SIPPIN,” the gruff freakout on “HONESTLY”—feel like ripoffs of Carti and Travis vocal tics. Some of the most thrilling new rappers, like che, make up for feeble writing with constantly morphing, freakily zonked beats. That was once the case for Lone. This time, it feels like he and Lil 88 were cooped up in the studio until they lost all perspective. Does Love Last Forever? is a question Lone could soon be asking his most faithful fans, whose patience may be tested by an album this flat and flavorless.",Rap,4.5
36,"On her most ambitious and musically diverse release to date, the TDE rapper and singer meets the pressures of success with defiance and irreverence. Four tracks into her new mixtape Alligator Bites Never Heal, Doechii is gasping for air. Don’t get it twisted: The 26-year-old rapper isn’t short on lung power. But after five years in the music industry—a period in which she signed to Kendrick Lamar’s former label Top Dawg Entertainment, earned a coveted spot in the 2022 XXL Freshman Class, and charted a platinum single with the R&B-focused “What It Is (Block Boy)”—Doechii yearned for the kind of breather that up-and-comers typically aren’t advised to take. In the final bars of “Denial Is a River,” a candid conversation with a therapist alter ego, Doechii illustrates the consequences of life in the fast lane: Her therapist suggests a breathing exercise, and Doechii hyperventilates rhythmically, flailing in the space between a scribble scratch and a panic attack.Alligator Bites Never Heal fits Doechii like an oxygen mask. On her most ambitious and musically diverse project to date—19 tracks that feel more sensitive and self-possessed than her recent spate of club-ready singles—she makes room for vulnerability. It’s a formidable full-length debut, fluid yet focused, that reprises her playful and melodic sides without skimping on hard-hitting hip-hop.Doechii splashed onto the scene with the 2020 EP Oh the Places You’ll Go, a seven-song collection more or less defined by the cutesy viral hit “Yucky Blucky Fruitcake.” she / her / black bitch, her 2022 debut EP for TDE, marked a definitive turn away from the bubbly aesthetic; on subsequent singles, Doechii pushed into harder and faster territory, embracing Rico Nasty’s punk sensibilities on “Pacer” and experimenting with house music on “Alter Ego.” She’s a capable chameleon, but the searching specificity of her early tracks has been MIA. As Doechii put it on recent single “MPH”: “I could give them the conscious shit, but I’m too busy giving them cunt.”Alligator Bites Never Heal is all about processing not posturing. Doechii raps with sober-minded confidence, acknowledging “lost friends, shed just like loose skin” and the pressures of label expectations and impostor syndrome. On opening track “Stanka Pooh,” she cycles through intrusive thoughts: “What if I choke on this Slurpee? What if I make it big? What if my car exploded while I’m casually pumping the gas and smoking a cig?” Just when it’s getting serious, she tempers the weight with a cutting couplet: “And if those the only fears that I’ll take to my grave/I’m pissing on you hoes living or dead.” That’s Doechii at her nuanced best—anxious, funny, pissing on hoes.",Rap,7.0
37,"Singer-songwriter Blair Howerton’s writing is full of doubt and vulnerability, but her band’s blend of shoegaze, fried country, and straight-ahead indie rock sounds more confident than ever. Cataclysms social, political, personal, and meteorological abound. It might be something in the water, or maybe every generation feels this crush in a unique way. Regardless, Why Bonnie’s Blair Howerton feels it too. Despite the urge to give up and let impending doom swallow her whole, Howerton and her band spend their new album, Wish on the Bone, relentlessly pushing forward. It’s almost Sisyphean, the way Howerton approaches songwriting. Sometimes it’s just not your day, but as the band posits on “Rhyme or Reason,” “Just tell me when/And I’ll be waiting.” Hope springs eternal.That inclination to optimism—or, at least, a dogged resistance to defeat—reflects in the brilliant compositions that make up Wish on the Bone. The style is always shifting, a restless combination of shoegaze, fried country, straight-ahead indie rock, lilting blues, and more. Howerton and bandmates Chance Williams and Josh Malett made the album with Jonathan Schenke, who co-produced alongside Howerton. Eschewing the Americana-leaning alt-rock of 2022 debut 90 in November, they take a broader look at independent rock’s many faces.Even with the expanded scope, Wish on the Bone is remarkably precise and exacting in its risk-taking. On 90 in November, Howerton wrote about Texas, the place she’d left a few years prior to move to New York. As such, it was filled with tributes to the state’s country roots, unseasonably hot weather, and nostalgia for a time that may not have ever existed. From the outset of Wish on the Bone, things sound different; deeper, more patient, serious. Why Bonnie sound tougher and more confident. Much of this is due to Howerton’s poignant lyricism, which flips from vulnerable to assured on a moment’s notice.On “Wish on the Bone,” thwacking drums and squawking guitars establish a sound somewhere between Songs Ohia and Hop Along. Howerton sings: “Sometimes it’s over before it gets started/So call me when the coast is clear.” It’s a theme she revisits on “Rhyme or Reason,” as if she’s been burnt by overeagerness in the past and now refuses to make the first move for fear of getting hurt.Howerton tends to sound skeptical of those she allows into her world, though Wish on the Bone is at its strongest when she occasionally allows herself to dream, wonder, and yearn. “All the Money” is a tension-filled freight train of a song, shaped by spine-tingling guitar runs and barely-there string atmospherics that lend a feeling of Hitchcockian suspense—a far more interesting tool than surprise. Above the foreboding tones, Howerton wonders: “What if I could/Be somebody’s baby/Never hurting, always loving/Baby?” Spare piano notes suggest such a proposition probably won’t end well.",Rock,7.4
38,"On a record originally conceived as an ode to joy, Nick Cave continues to grapple with the all-consuming nature of grief. Pushed to rapturous extremes, the album sounds as haunted as it is healing. Back in 2018, a good 40 years into his musical career, Nick Cave made the leap from perennial theater attraction to arena-rock act. And while his promoters at AEG admitted at the time they were rolling the dice, the move was a key part of a masterplan to position Cave as the last alt-rock icon standing, filling the void left by Leonard Cohen, David Bowie, and Lou Reed. It was a lofty goal, to be sure, but in hindsight, they were actually selling Cave short: He’s really become something more like the goth Oprah. For Cave, music is just one part of a robust multimedia enterprise that spans books, films, speaking engagements, life coaching, and—the ultimate mark of personal-brand proliferation—his own homewares line. These days, Cave exists in an orbit of celebrity that would’ve seemed unfathomable even back when he was duetting with Kylie Minogue and writing screenplays for Guy Pearce flicks. There he is attending King Charles’ coronation. There he is taking songwriting tips from his pal Chris Martin. There he is gently grooving to “Glory Days” in the VIP section at a Springsteen concert alongside Chris Rock, Lars Ulrich, and Sting. At this point, Cave has become the rare musician who gets invited onto Colbert not to perform, but to sit on the couch and chat at length with the host.Cave hasn’t achieved this new stratum of fame by making his music more accessible—in fact, his body of work since 2013’s transitional Push the Sky Away encompasses the most unconventional, anti-rock gestures of his career, effectively transforming the Bad Seeds from his fearsome backing band to his impressionistic backdrop. Rather, Cave has broadened his reach by making himself more emotionally accessible. Since losing his teenage son Arthur to a tragic accident in 2015, Cave has transformed the process of grieving into a sort of ongoing interactive art project, guided by his candor and generosity of spirit. In his Red Hand Files newsletter, he counsels fans through their own hours of need; in concert, the once confrontational frontman now spends much of his time roaming through the audience or inviting them onstage, literally reaching out to his parishioners to elicit moments of physical connection and communal catharsis. But if Cave’s past decade has presented us with two parallel narratives—the crowd-pleasing showman vs. the tireless experimentalist—with Wild God, he conjures their point of intersection.",Rock,8.0
39,"The multimedia artist’s latest release is a fictionalized retelling of Amelia Earhart’s final voyage. A brisk and largely frictionless record, it’s nonetheless filled with moments of awestruck wonder. Laurie Anderson’s debut album, 1982’s Big Science, opens with a plane crash. Ever since, aircraft have figured inauspiciously in her work. The jets ominously crisscrossing “O Superman” (“Here come the planes/They’re American planes,” she intones) took on an even more portentous cast when she performed the song shortly after 9/11. In 2017, Anderson created a virtual reality installation, Aloft, that simulates sitting in a plane that slowly dissolves, leaving the viewer suspended in midair. At least some of these pieces may be drawn from Anderson’s own experience: She once survived the wreck of a small commercial plane. “It took a long time, ten minutes, from the time the first engine started sputtering to crash,” she recently recalled. “It sounds like nothing at all, ten minutes, and yet when you’re in a situation like that and you can’t move, it feels like the longest time imaginable.”Anderson’s new album Amelia plays similar tricks with time, but in reverse, compressing the last 44 days of Amelia Earhart’s life into a breezy 35 minutes. A fictionalized retelling of the pilot’s ill-fated 1937 attempt to circumnavigate the globe, it is, essentially, the chronicle of a crash foretold. From the very first engine noises that open the album, growling like a World War II dogfight, we know exactly how this story will end: with the 39-year-old adventurer, technologist, and feminist pioneer disappearing somewhere over the Pacific, never to be found.Like 2018’s Landfall—a rumination on the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in collaboration with the Kronos Quartet—Amelia pairs Anderson’s hypnotic style of vocalizing with a contemporary classical ensemble (Filharmonie Brno, conducted by Dennis Russell Davies). But Amelia, despite its tragic final act, is a lighter and livelier reflection: a celebration of Earhart’s life and spirit, and an occasionally awestruck meditation on the magnitude of her quest.Anderson uses multiple perspectives to tell Earhart’s story. Flatly objective logbook data bleed into fictionalized journal entries (“It was the sound of the motor I remember the most”). Telegrams (“Fred unable to set his chronometers. Stop. Personal unfitness. Stop. Looking bad for arrival in Oakland July 4th stop. Stop.”) alternate with third-person narration delivered with the coolly objective tone of an encyclopedia entry. Anderson uses different vocal styles and registers to accommodate these overlapping perspectives, while ANOHNI, singing through a vocoder, gives voice to the waves and the wind.These fragmented scenes suggest the kaleidoscopic perspective of a text like Michael Ondaatje’s Coming Through Slaughter, but in its brevity and gliding pace, Amelia feels more like a PBS special; you can practically see the red line moving across the animated map, the tastefully reenacted cockpit vignettes, the sleek montage of newspaper headlines and newsreel footage. Anderson has said that an earlier version of the piece was overstuffed with instruments and ideas, but Amelia flits briskly from scene to scene, with just enough musical backing to flesh out the atmosphere: shimmering oceanic drones; subtly driving pulses; dissonant whorls abruptly smoothed into reassuring consonance. A handful of guest musicians, including jazz guitarist Marc Ribot, flesh out Anderson’s impressionistic soundscapes, but they’re so carefully integrated into the whole that you might never notice their individual presence. Despite brief moments of tumult, it is a largely frictionless listen.",Experimental,7.1
40,"On its fourth album, the Los Angeles-based group confronts the mysteries of memory and time in richly layered songs informed by classic indie pop, classical minimalism, and gentle psychedelia. In the middle of “Lie in the Gutter,” a track near the end of Rose Main Reading Room, Joseph Stevens and his collaborators in Peel Dream Magazine slip into a trance state. A vibraphone softly repeats an eighth-note figure, vocalist Olivia Babuka Black coos a wordless phrase, and syncopated guitar plucks bounce off a pulsing bassline. It’s all held together by a muted but propulsive motorik beat. This isn’t new territory for the band—beginning with 2018’s Modern Meta Physic, Peel Dream Magazine have taken cues from bands like Stereolab and Pram, exploring the ways that rigid, droning repetition can make time feel rubbery. As they snap back into the present, Black sings, “Millions of light years, all of them ours.” The past and future fold into themselves, braided together in perpetuity.Like a scientist collecting data, Stevens travels through time throughout Rose Main Reading Room, Peel Dream Magazine’s fourth album. His observations have him spider-webbing through questions of identity, experience, and perception. Though he now resides in Los Angeles, Stevens grew up just north of New York City and lived in Brooklyn for many years. The album was inspired by recollections of childhood trips to Manhattan and, as an adult, days off spent meandering through the borough’s storied landmarks. A theoretical alternate universe might contain infinitely looping versions of Stevens sitting in the New York Public Library or wandering around the Museum of Natural History, each holding the weight of a specific private era. When Stevens returns to those personally sacred parts of the city, as he does on “Central Park West,” the record’s dreamy second song, those former selves appear like leaves in the fossil record, offering clues to who he was and who he has become.Stevens’ songwriting is fascinated with cycles. Tumbling, Philip Glass-like woodwinds mirror the rhythm of a rote morning routine; lyrics montage together a hand grabbing keys from their place on a counter, a comb running through hair, an arm sliding into a coat. On “Recital,” Stevens recounts the ritual of piano recitals as a youngster, describing delicate details in both present and progressive tense. The songs students play are always different, but the same people show up each year; the same sense of adolescent shame and embarrassment hangs in the air. In nearly every song, melodies switch between keys or guitar, previewing the notes Black or Stevens will sing later. Everything repeats but never duplicates; each revolution forms not a clean circle but a spring that contracts and expands.",Rock,7.3
41,"Following LPs for ketamine therapy and chemical voyages, the UK producer’s latest record stems from his soundtrack for a stroboscopic psychedelic gizmo. It’s his most single-mindedly epic LP. Getting his young mind blown to Stravinsky while stoned. Making an album to enhance a ketamine therapy session. Releasing two more LPs that pay tribute to tripping on mushrooms and rolling on MDMA. Few artists are as honest about electronic music’s chemical accoutrements as Jon Hopkins, and even fewer can capture those reality-altering feelings in instrumental tracks. His style of techno is shapeshifting and time-warping, with stadium-ready atmospherics and larger-than-life textures. (This is a producer who opened for Coldplay, after all.) Hopkins makes music for people who aren’t necessarily into the club—you could imagine his albums played in a planetarium, Pink Floyd-style, as well as soundtracking the heaving festival crowds where he thrives.Making music for rowdy live performances seems to be the furthest thing from Hopkins’ mind these days. His recent turn to ambient music placed his work in a controlled environment, sealing off the wild abandon of his landmark LPs Immunity and Singularity. Recent tracks with fellow electronic musician HAAi touched on past glories, but on Ritual, his seventh album, he digs his heels in with an ambient-leaning 41-minute composition that isn’t too far removed from 2021’s watered-down Music for Psychedelic Therapy. Ritual is Hopkins’ most epic record, and also the most two-dimensional, honing his thrilling ups and downs into one long build-up and release.Like his last LP, Ritual has its roots in a psychedelic experiment: the Dreamachine, a modern recreation of a 1959 invention that used flickering lights to trigger trippy visuals when users closed their eyes. The latest version is marketed as both entertainment and therapy, and Hopkins is listed on its website as an official composer. Like any kind of product with iffy wellness implications, Ritual is vaguely calming, a particularly elegant Rorschach blob. Are you feeling it? Is it working? What is it supposed to do, exactly? For his part, to match the Dreamachine ethos, Hopkins says that the type of “ritual” the LP is meant to accompany is up to the listener. So, in the parlance of self-care, you’ll have to do the work yourself.Hopkins is joined by a handful of musicians on violin, cello, guitar, and vocals, as well as past collaborator 7RAYS and IDM auteur Clark, but Ritual is pure Jon Hopkins. All the familiar elements are here: hushed coos, the quiet roil of sustained strings, synths that float by and leave vapor trails in their wake. The smooth shimmer conjures Brian Eno’s mid-’80s period, when the ambient pioneer started to stretch out with extended pieces Thursday Afternoon and Neroli. A kraut-y rhythm takes hold—“part iii – transcend / lament” sounds like Stars of the Lid in the studio with Last Resort-era Trentemøller—and the lines between acoustic and electronic are blurred. Eventually the slamming beats come in, though the drums are more like the graceful movements of a percussive troupe than the bone-crunching textures of Immunity.",Electronic,6.5
42,"The Chicago cellist’s new album is an ode to the din of everyday life, transforming the mundanity of buzzing fridges and clicking turn signals into moments of unlikely beauty. In the summer of 1966, Morton Feldman—a composer known for mournful elegance and minimalist restraint—was feeling kvetchy. In a freeform conversation with John Cage at New York’s WBAI studios, he griped that a recent trip to the beach had been spoiled by the proliferation of transistor radios “blaring out rock’n’roll.” Cage, ever philosophical, was more circumspect. “Well, you know how I adjusted to that problem of the radio in the environment?” he asked his friend and fellow avant-gardist: He simply composed a piece using radios. Now whenever he heard the din of clashing broadcasts in public, he continued, chuckling: “I think, well, they’re just playing my piece.”The Chicago cellist and composer Lia Kohl cited Cage and Feldman’s conversation in a recent interview, with good reason: Her music represents a similar rapprochement with the racket of everyday life. On her 2023 album The Ceiling Reposes, she lifted snippets from the airwaves—drive-time chatter, weather forecasts, stock-market reports—to use as accidental counterpoints to contemplative cello improvisations and atmospheric synth sketches. She goes further on Normal Sounds, extending her net to catch all manner of noises (buzzing fridges, tinkling ice-cream trucks, honking car horns) that she mixes into a richly tonal, patiently melodic electroacoustic blend.There’s plenty of precedent for this kind of quotidian found sound, particularly in electronic music. The late Peter Rehberg, collaborating with Vienna’s General Magic, placed contact mics on a refrigerator to create 1995’s winking Fridge Trax. Matthew Herbert turned to kitchen utensils and toothbrushes on 1998’s Around the House; Matmos sourced every note on 2016’s Ultimate Care II out of a Whirlpool washing machine. But Kohl—who calls her album “a love letter to the mundane sonic world, to the part of my brain that just can’t stop listening to everything, all the time”—takes a different approach from her predecessors.The Secret Language of Laundry: Inside Matmos’ Washing Machine AlbumRehberg & General Magic and Matmos remained faithful to the throbbing, buzzing thingliness of their machines; Herbert swirled his source material into tastefully jazzy house until its provenance was largely moot. Kohl’s approach is less transformative and more literal. Even if it weren’t for titles like “Car Alarm, Turn Signal” and “Ice Cream Truck, Tornado Siren,” there’s a good chance that you could identify at least some of the sounds she uses. She makes no attempt to disguise the supermarket chimes of “Airport Fridge, Self Checkout,” or the flight attendant’s directions and nearby video-console bleeps on “Plane.” Instead, she uses them as creative prompts for her own writing, playing off what she overhears and finding music in the incidental, much the way Steve Reich exploited the musicality of his interlocutors in Different Trains.",Experimental,7.9
43,"The Australian musician better known for his indie-pop project Golden Vessel turns to crisply banging productions heavily inspired by contemporary Latin club. Maxwell Byrne has a Pop artist’s appreciation for ridiculous scale and shiny surfaces. The Brisbane musician frequently complements his tracks with cartoonishly outsized set pieces like a human hamster cage, wonky papier-mâché lightning bolts, or Jurassic Park. For megacity1000, his second full-length dance record as 1tbsp, Byrne created a miniature metropolis of the future—a bizarro utopia, equal parts SimCity and Abu Dhabi—and added an spoken-word introduction rhapsodizing about the promise of urban living. Even if the record’s concept ultimately feels about as durable as the cardboard skyscrapers that Byrne and his partner spent a month toiling over, megacity1000 is his most reliably fun and intricately constructed collection of club music to date.As Golden Vessel, Byrne is an established figure in Australia’s indie-pop scene, and a prolific and respected collaborator with a host of artists including Mallrat and BAYNK (with whom he was nominated for a Grammy last year). But Byrne has also become an increasingly in-demand DJ, and he’s released a clutch of well-received bangers as 1tbsp. That’s a promising development, because he’s a more compelling producer than he is a performer; his ear for detail conveys far more personality than the bland anonymity of his winsome Triple J vocal delivery.Byrne has an easy and infectious command of rhythm, stacking his drums so that they thump, rattle, and gallop all at once, and balancing his tracks’ pent-up momentum with blindingly bright synths. This interplay between surface shimmer and rhythmic muscle makes even the most relentless songs feel oddly lightweight and lithe. “Neurasync” and “MC1K” give off a metallic glint reminiscent of K-LONE at his most punchy and dynamic, while the bouncy guitar groove supporting the affectless vocals on “Somebody Pay Nina” sounds as if someone took Oli XL on a tropical vacation.“Latin Club” May Be Controversial, But It’s ThrivingEven though Byrne’s fictional city doesn’t belong to any specific geographic region, it’s hard to imagine it isn’t located within earshot of a TraTraTrax party. The influence of Latin club is pronounced across the record, particularly in its many sped-up reggaeton samples, which he uses to heighten the intensity. Given the relatively short run time, the recurrence of those motifs can occasionally feel like a crutch, a shorthand for another level of party-starting that 1tbsp doesn’t totally earn.The best Spanish-language track by far is “Limosina,” which features a shit-talking performance by Cherry Chola. Byrne lays down spritely synth plucks and an impatient, stuttering beat; the Venezuelan Australian singer compares her glamorous lifestyle with your shitty Corolla before driving off to the sound of garish flashing synths. The two forceful personalities cut a carefree path through Byrne’s imagined city, conveying a particularly inspired sense of place.",Electronic,7.0
44,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit the Ween’s landmark 1994 album, a genius pop record made by two idiots—or vice versa. Before TikTok, before Guitar Hero placements, before iPod ads, and before The O.C., the hopes and dreams of fledgling alt-rock acts lay in the hands of two teenage chuckleheads in Highland, Texas. Debuting in 1993, Beavis and Butt-Head was nominally a crude animated comedy about a pair of horny, headbanging ne’er-do-wells. But in those segments when its titular characters channel-surfed through the station’s latest Buzz Bin offerings, it became America’s most influential outpost of armchair music criticism, capable of turbocharging a band’s Soundscan numbers with a simple “this rules.” And as MTV’s highest-rated show in the mid-’90s, Beavis and Butt-Head also had enough clout to thrust strange, obscure groups into the national spotlight even when they thought they sucked.“What the hell is this crap?” Butt-Head exclaimed when confronted with Ween’s 1992 single “Push Th’ Little Daisies.” Even in the midst of a ’90s alt-rock boom that encouraged the masses to turn and face the strange, the song was odd, sounding like a nursery rhyme performed by a Casiotone-toting hotel-lounge act fronted by a six-year-old. But perhaps Beavis and Butt-Head’s allergic reaction to the song had as much to do with the fact that, in Ween, they saw an older, funhouse-mirror version of themselves. “Push Th’ Little Daisies” wasn’t just an annoying earworm, but a cautionary tale of what happens when two music- and sex-obsessed young men spend a little too much time on the couch doing mushrooms, cracking themselves up with dirty jokes in their own made-up vernacular.As big fans of Beavis and Butt-Head, Ween’s Aaron Freeman and Mickey Melchiondo (a.k.a. Gene Ween and Dean Ween) took the critique in stride—after all, “What the hell is this crap?” is a question these childhood friends were used to hearing ever since they forged their home-recording society in New Hope, Pennsylvania, circa 1984. It’s a question that no doubt consumed the unruly crowd at Trenton’s City Gardens in 1991, when the duo performed an infamous opening slot for Fugazi while high on ’shrooms as patrons flung chewing gum in their hair, and it’s likely what prompted a skinhead to punch Melchiondo in the face after a show in Minneapolis in ’89. In fact, “What the hell is this crap?” is precisely the reaction the duo sought to elicit with each and every song they produced, where they variously conjured ’60s-pop sweetness,’70s hard-rock hysterics, and ’80s-funk sleaze using the rudiments of hardcore, pawn-shop electro, and dollar-bin reggae. And as if their music wasn’t confounding enough, the duo also pledged allegiance to an imaginary demon god known as The Boognish, which was like their DIY-doodle version of Iron Maiden’s Eddie.",Rock,9.0
45,"Originally released in 1976, the pioneering artist’s debut album is filled with countless moments of disarming beauty. It plays like a map of her musical passions, linking folk traditions with avant-garde innovation. Dorothy Carter was in her early 40s when she recorded her largely instrumental, entirely entrancing album Troubadour. Although the 1976 release was her debut album, she had already lived many, many lives by then and enjoyed a storied career. An artist attracted to obscure, often unwieldy instruments, she studied music at Bard College and the Royal Academy of Arts, but it was a foregone conclusion that she would chafe at the rigidity of academia. She busked all over the world in search of new sounds and new inspirations, even spending a year at a convent in Mexico where she is said to have experienced epiphanic spiritual visions. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, she played in an improvisational collective called the Central Maine Power Company with a handful of fellow eccentrics (including New Age pioneer Constance Demby), and Carter always provided a melodic counterpart to what they dubbed “not music.” But she found her greatest commercial success with the classical group Mediæval Bæbes, who in the ’90s rode a wave of interest in early music (in particular Gregorian chant, but also string ensembles) to something resembling popularity.Throughout her life, Carter amassed a collection of instruments that weren’t taught in music schools: zithers, hurdy-gurdys, psalteries, Irish harps, and more, some with so many modifications they barely resembled their original forms. She spent her final years in New Orleans, reportedly squatting in a warehouse that lacked heat and running water but had enough space for her musical menagerie. All the obsessions that motivated her entire career can be heard in Troubadour. Tracked at a small studio in Boston and featuring members of the Power Music Company, who produced and added flourishes of tamboura (an ancient Greek stringed instrument) and ch’in (a traditional Chinese zither), it plays like a map of Carter’s musical passions, tracing rivers and roads between folk tradition and avant-garde innovation. It found a small audience in the Boston and New York folk scenes, but didn’t travel much further. There’s no conspiracy here about label malfeasance or listener apathy. Carter never set out to make a record with overt gestures toward commercial viability, although perhaps Drag City’s new reissue will prompt a popular reappraisal, especially on the heels of last year’s repressing of Carter’s second album, the trippier, more vocal-oriented Waillee Waillee.As novel as an album of hammered dulcimer and psaltery might sound, Troubadour is not just accessible but bracing, full of big ideas and moments of disarming beauty. At the heart of the album is the dulcimer, an instrument whose sound is difficult to describe. When Carter strikes those taut strings with her hammers, she produces an unusual sound—pointillist? pixelated?—with a vivid, punchy slapback, as though we’re hearing the note and its immediate echo at the same time. Her rapid hammering on “Visiting Song” sounds like sculpted rain. Because she’s such a spirited player, it’s not hard to get lost in these songs, to lose track of time in the spiraling melody of “Lark in the Morning” or in the gentle pulse of “Masquerade,” one of only a few originals on Troubadour.",Folk,8.7
46,"In the ’90s, Seefeel evolved through shoegaze and post-rock to create their own unsettling brand of ambient dub. Breaking a 13-year hiatus, they’re still finding new magic in old tricks. When new sounds from Seefeel last filtered in, they sounded older than ever. Mark Clifford, Sarah Peacock, and various collaborators had, for some two decades, distilled the aquatic shoegaze rave of early classics like 1993’s Quique into the minerally syrup of 1995’s Succour, the chemical fumes of the following year’s (Ch-Vox) and then, finally, the brilliant and parched sediment of 2011’s Seefeel, so bright you had to squint at it. By that point, their grooves were more dust than dub. The timeless now of their long, lovely songs had faded into unstable memories, and then acts of remembering, via fascinating reissues in packages that felt like terminal excavations.Which makes Everything Squared, Seefeel’s mini-album of new recordings, such an unexpected joy. It’s not just that Clifford has figured out a route back to the old ways, although, blissfully, he has; nor simply that there’s still an audience for such endeavors. The pleasure of this half hour lies in its optimism—its faith that so much can be made of so little, still.“Lose the Minus,” for example, offers only the essential: a simple bass tone that manages to both defy gravity and trace its effects; a whisper of melody; Peacock’s voice, glistening with a simple FX gloss. A guitar vibrates, then crests. It’s over. It’s enough. While equally brief, “End of Here” is sort of its opposite, an exercise in fullness made of fuzz and decay. It’s almost too much, then it leaves you alone.Elsewhere, Clifford and Peacock let themselves stretch. The beguiling “Hooked Paw” swaps out the band’s sonar blips for crunchy building blocks that tumble into thick, bassy depths. Seefeel are not exactly a funky band, but they swing more than they’re given credit for. And with its scratched, metallic frame, “Antiskeptic” reminds you that Seefeel’s roots are as much industrial as ambient. The crooking rhythm is a kind of window through which bright streaks of synths arch and scatter. Occasionally, trance chords flash like artificial lightning. The world-building creates tension. Seefeel’s early now becomes what will happen next?Peacock’s voice often answers that question. She belongs in the pantheon of vocalists—from peers like Slowdive’s Rachel Goswell and My Bloody Valentine’s Bilinda Butcher to contemporary wonders like Beach House’s Victoria Legrand and more eaze and L’Rain, and of course the miraculous Elizabeth Fraser—who figure out ways to sing without always forming words. Instead, Peacock makes moments. In “Hooked Paw,” a murmur becomes a hall of mirrors. In opener “Sky Hooks,” her voice is the star, shining front and center in an arrangement of foggy bass, swooping pads, and crowds of sizzling noise and chimes that gather to form the track’s climax before vanishing into echoes. Peacock offers navigation and, maybe, even a kind of narrative to follow.",Electronic,8.0
47,"On their third album, cloud pop-rap stars Coco & Clair Clair’s barbed quips and cheeky attitude let you know they really care. Like a straight-to-Tubi film, lobotomy-pop duo Coco & Clair Clair are low-budget, resourceful, full of comedically high aspirations. They are extremely fun, extremely dumb. Theirs is a performance of bad taste and brainlessness, a reaction and antidote to pseudo-intellectuality. While they grew up listening to John Maus and Bill Callahan in the Atlanta suburbs, the music they’re making now is closer in spirit to the Black Eyed Peas. In Coco & Clair Clair’s world, vapidness is next to godliness.Since at least 2021, when singer and TikToker Chrissy Chlapecka tagged a clip #bimbocore and helped ignite a trend, the popular It Girl has styled herself as an irreverent ditz, a “thot daughter,” a resident of Barbie’s deathless world. This summer, Charli XCX’s BRAT complicated that dominant mode, finding a certain truth behind the performance and edging toward earnestness with songs like “Girl, so confusing” and “I think about it all the time.” With their third album, Girl, Coco & Clair Clair take their barbed quips and cheeky attitude so far that they find their landing place on the other side of irreverence.Girl easily could have met a predictable rom-com ending—a simple taming of the shrew wrap-up—but instead it feels genuinely hard-fought, as though they’ve formed a closer relationship to truth without sacrificing their comedic absurdity. “I’m too rare for Raya, stop inviting me, cucks,” raps Clair Clair on “Kate Spade.” On previous albums the pair were unsentimental and impervious to romance, but on Girl they dare to be tender, even obsequious. They say they’ve recovered discarded lyrics they once deemed too personal to share. One likely suspect: “Do you see me like I want you to see me?/Will you think I’m cool if I watch this movie?” Clair Clair raps nervously on “Gorgeous International Really Lucky.”Girl is also more structurally robust than anything they’ve made before, the production sharper and less self-consciously lo-fi. That’s mostly because they lean unashamedly into pastiche. “Martini” sounds like a cloud rap type beat; “Everyone But You” like Dean Blunt sampling Incubus; “My Girl” like a tribute to Crystal Castles. The broad-strokes approach to musical influences showcases their talent for summoning the ghost of an original, then using bizarrely specific lyricism to tack against its formula. It is so funny to hear, for instance, Coco rap something as plainly ridiculous as “Don’t come yapping with that damn fucking beak” on the Opium-indebted “Bitches Pt. 2.”Whatever style they play with, Coco & Clair Clair have a clear talent for finding its most naive, exuberant aspects. You can hear that best on the album’s main landmark: a breakbeat cover of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young’s “Our House.” It sounds hilarious (and it is), but it’s also strangely touching. Its uncanny emotional resonance recalls a scene in Xavier Dolan’s Mommy, when the protagonist skates to a “Wonderwall” needle drop and appears to widen the aspect ratio with his hands. “Our House” is Coco & Clair Clair’s widescreen moment—when something initially mistaken for irony deepens into sincerity, the confusion of emotions and cultural associations giving way to an authentic, unblinkered response to the art. On Girl, Coco & Clair Clair display a more sophisticated musical and emotional palette while retaining the charm of bedroom hobbyists. At last, they have everything a woman could possibly want.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

48,"The English singer-songwriter’s debut swings big, tackling themes of death and patriarchal oppression through earthy imagery and dense alt-pop arrangements. In 2022, fledgling Derbyshire musician Paris Paloma entered a professional studio for the first time and recorded “Labour,” a big, theatrical statement about the contradictory expectations placed on women in heterosexual relationships. In a clip that went viral on TikTok, simmering frustration with gender roles boils over: “All day, every day/Therapist, mother, maid/Nymph then a virgin/Nurse then a servant.” Paloma’s full-length debut, Cacophony, bears the fruits of years of “Labour,” expanding on that song’s feminist themes through lush alt-pop and endless vocal layering. In virtually every interview, Paloma names Florence and the Machine and Hozier as formative influences; add an album structure loosely inspired by the hero’s journey, and Cacophony sounds too ambitious to pull off. But with a surprising depth in writing and production, the album often hits its lofty goals.Paloma and producer Justin Glasco were already at work well before “Labour” blew up, and from the opening song, it’s clear this record wasn’t made with TikTok metrics in mind. “My Mind (Now)” starts with a nearly incomprehensible a capella verse before Paloma gasps for air and all hell breaks loose: chiptune synths, menacing synth bass, and Paul Frith’s dramatic trumpet fanfares. Paloma’s formidable voice, controlled but expressive, is the calm in the storm. The rest of Cacophony isn’t as cacophonous, but even the quieter tracks are packed full of dense vocal production—the auto-panned backing vocals on Paloma’s self-produced “Pleaser” and the formant-shifted counterpoint on “Bones on the Beach” add to the sense of restless unease.Though she’s not the first person to tackle this subject matter, Paloma roots it in earthy imagery and personal anecdote. Highlight “Boys, Bugs, and Men” traces the logical conclusion of “boys will be boys”-style apologia from little kids squashing insects to grown men enacting violence with impunity: “I see hunger/Looking for a sign/That any of your destruction had me suffering inside/It fills you with light/To take away mine.” On “Last Woman on Earth,” the record’s darkest point, Paloma fears even death won’t provide release. Alluding to Hugh Hefner’s interment next to Marilyn Monroe, she asks that her body be fed to animals instead—a morbid but understandable request in the year of the man-or-bear debate. “His Land” is the one time she overreaches: Atop ’90s new age piano and schmaltzy strings, overstuffed lines like “The lake that he gatekeeps/Yet I know not what for” wind up a misguided mix of modern and antiquated syntax.Amid the righteous anger, Paloma finds room for more lighthearted moments. She’s surprisingly tongue-in-cheek on “Drywall” as she flips the stereotype of the overly emotional woman back on a volatile man who’s putting holes in the walls (“Eggshell temperament/No emotional regulation/Hysterical baby”). Two tracks before “Last Woman on Earth,” “Triassic Love Song” is an unexpectedly sweet paleontology ballad about the Triassic Cuddle, a prehistoric fossil in which a protomammal and an amphibian intertwine. Even “Boys, Bugs, and Men” disguises its social commentary in breezy pop. The battle of light and dark reaches its apotheosis on “Bones on the Beach,” concluding with the record’s simplest and most powerful line: “Death won’t bring what you think it will.”",Pop,6.8
49,"On their first album in 24 years, Rose Melberg and Jen Sbragia are indie-pop minimalists with the biggest of hearts, conveying complex adult emotions with the freedom and possibility of youth. In the world of the Softies, to crush is to live. Their songs are pop miniatures where the spectrum of human feeling seems to ripple outward from the bittersweet ache of liking a person so much that your mind is pulled obsessively in one direction, however momentarily. Maybe it is Rose Melberg and Jen Sbragia’s 30-year friendship and indelible, world-of-its-own musical chemistry—two plainspoken voices, two sparkling guitars, and space—that helps communicate that intimacy so effectively. From the initial notes of The Bed I Made, the Softies’ fourth album and first in 24 years, their harmonies have never glowed brighter, and it’s chilling. “I’m drifting at sea without you,” they sing in unison on “Go Back in Time.” But they’ve found their best anchor again.The Softies are indie-pop legends. From the pre-internet era of fanzines and snail mail on, Melberg’s early California punk bands Tiger Trap and Go Sailor have become talismanic for lovers of DIY pop, earnest emotion, and scrappy minimalism. Tiger Trap started when Melberg was still in high school—her first onstage performance ever was an impromptu song during the legendary International Pop Underground Convention—releasing a sole 1993 LP on K Records and opening for the likes of Fugazi and Beat Happening. The endless succession of raw hooks on songs like “Puzzle Pieces” and “Super Crush” set the vulnerability and Everly Brothers wonder of Melberg’s future projects (and earned her major-label interest—maybe the same ones chasing Jawbreaker?—which the band declined). Sbragia, meanwhile, was a former metal guitarist and Tiger Trap fan who got to know Melberg through letters. Embracing simplicity and oddity, the Softies floated on jazzy chords and negative space that could be incandescent like the Marine Girls or coolly complex like Australia’s the Cat’s Miaow. Their entwined dynamic was so tightly woven that songs about their platonic friendship still sound like romance: “I can’t love you the way he does, I can only love you more,” Melberg sings to her bandmate on their 1995 debut, It’s Love.The Bed I Made is a lovely introduction to their orbit. The Softies render teen-spirited drama with adult equanimity, just as they convey adult emotions with the possibilities and freedom of youth. “At this point in my life, I have experienced more loss,” Sbragia noted in a recent interview. “But crushes not working out is my favorite songwriting topic, apparently.” Emotional maturity shines through these twilight songs about smartly exiting doomed romantic situations rather than untangling them, about self-possession and having the conviction to speak your mind. “How could I know how to fall out of love?” Melberg sings in her angelic soprano on “I Said What I Said.” “You were kind and fair/You can’t fake feelings that aren’t there,” she reasons on “California Highway 99,” but she still gets away as fast as possible. The negative space of Softies songs has always made them feel viscerally sadder—as if representing the void of the dejection—but here it also makes tiny notes feel bigger and brighter, illuminating the moments when harmonies crash perfectly together in clarity and camaraderie.",Rock,8.0
50,"Over bitcrushed, kick-heavy beats, the DMV street rapper’s scenes from everyday life reveal a more introspective take on the region’s distinctive sound. According to Washington, DC’s Jaeychino, DMV street rap underwent a subtle vibe shift in 2022. Much of the scene’s output has retained a recognizably rambling, syncopated flow and kick-heavy production style over the past half-decade. But in the last two years, its rising stars have distanced themselves from the drill-adjacent “free car music,” embracing moody soundscapes and reflective lyricism. “That free car shit was just draining,” the 19-year-old told an interviewer earlier this year. His recent run of mixtapes—alongside efforts by regional peers like Nino Paid and KP Skywalka—provides a cathartic alternative, treating 16s like trauma release exercises. While there’s plenty of reminiscing on WATCH THE THRONE, Jaeychino’s latest release, his songcraft is also grounded in the present, juxtaposing painful recollections against a mundane stream of scenes from his everyday life. He makes time fold in on itself, scattering fragments of memory across stuttering, distorted production.As usual, Jaeychino primarily collaborates with local talent, sourcing most of his beats from DC’s SJR and ian affiliate sxprano. Their collective influences are more diverse than ever. The instrumentals on “GOD INTERLUDE” and “WOODY” harken back to Icedancer-era Bladee, buffeting elegant cloud rap samples with glitchy, kaleidoscopic filters. On the former song, squeaky synth leads short-circuit as Jaeychino reflects on his tumultuous teenage years and the hope his recent success brings; there’s a sense of detachment in his delivery, as if he’s still not quite processed it all. He’s torn up over finding out that his own father stole from him, but the trauma is divulged as a quick aside, sandwiched between memories of scamming food delivery apps in high school and checking the view counts on song uploads. Where do you even start when there’s so much to confess and it’s all still so raw?Jaeychino’s lyrics usually lean depressing, but WATCH THE THRONE’s moments of levity are its most compelling tracks. On “Iloveindy 2,” one of his many odes to his girlfriend, he’s riding high on a psychedelic beat by NYC-based duo Evilgiane and Braindeadd, driving aimlessly through their city when he’s struck by sudden feelings of love. The translucent clouds of sub bass and triumphant, brassy melodies would feel right at home in a Nintendo DS-era Pokémon. “Bridgerton Sex Scene,” a track about hooking up while the titular Netflix show plays in the background, is so oddly specific you’d think Jaeychino hopped in the booth and recapped his entire morning. It’s like he’s the DMV’s Frank O’Hara, dashing off a lunch poem in his free time.With their emphasis on flickering, bitcrushed textures, most of the beats add a cybernetic touch to Jaeychino’s diaristic raps. But the pair of straight-ahead sample drill songs, which loop source material by the Cranberries and Imogen Heap, are disappointingly safe outliers. Did the underground really need another “Just For Now” flip? His experiments in fusing street rap subgenres with influences from esoteric corners of SoundCloud are much more compelling, like the clubby flirtations with digicore and IDM on “Armed & Dangerous.” As he fits together pieces of a stressful adolescence, he’s forging a new, more experimental path within the DC area’s angsty post-free car sound. Jaeychino is still coming into his own, but the DMV underground’s throne is squarely in his view.",Rap,7.0
51,"On a stark, somber album rooted in gospel samples, the Brooklyn rapper examines the relationship between Black Americans and Christianity, while seeking a new framework for his own faith. It took a sense of righteous outrage for Martin Luther to nail his Ninety-Five Theses to the door of Wittenberg’s All Saints’ Church in 1517, emphatically announcing his opposition to the Roman Catholic Church’s practice of selling indulgences in exchange for salvation. It’s unclear what the final straw was for Ka, but the Brownsville rapper delivers a similar diatribe with his stunning, strident new album The Thief Next to Jesus. Spotlighting the fraught relationship between Christianity and Black Americans, the rapper born Kaseem Ryan explores the hypocrisy of a religion that preaches deliverance yet subjugates its followers—and argues the urgent need to reframe that bond.Ka is no stranger to ambitious themes. He’s utilized chess (The Night’s Gambit in 2013), Greek mythology (Orpheus vs. the Sirens in 2018), and feudal Japanese codes (2016’s Honor Killed the Samurai) as conduits for self-analysis. He has mined his upbringing to craft cinematic epics that covertly lead you down the pain-filled alleyways of the city that raised him. On The Thief Next to Jesus, he displays tunnel-vision focus as he takes aim at the complicated links between Black Americans and Christianity.Ka’s albums have long been rooted in Biblical allegories. His 11th solo album feels like a spiritual extension of his 2019 release Descendants of Cain, where he invoked the story of Abel’s brother to portray himself as having been forsaken by the world. This time he calls upon the tale of the thieves on the cross: Both mocked Jesus, but one repented, receiving last-minute salvation before being crucified. The rapper knows what it means to see redemption slip away; left by the wayside by a religion that preaches eternal love, he seeks a new relationship with spirituality. Ka’s bluntness is his superpower as he pulls off some of the clearest writing of his recent run.Tying his autobiographical bars to Christian canon makes it sounds as though Ka’s passed through a baptism by fire. “Thought I’d be finished in the gutter sooner/Every other corner was crack spots,” he raps on “Broken Rose Window,” relating tales of hardship and alienation in Brooklyn. Much of Ka’s allure stems from the way he packs his worldview into singular phrases wound so tightly that they’re made to feel like secret koans that you carry in your heart until you need them: “I plan my death before I plan submission,” he declares on “Borrowed Time.” Simple sentences land with the impact of grand soliloquies, unfurling his philosophical dogma in just a few words. Using understated, purposeful phrases and fragments, Ka draws you in, forcing you to hang onto each word. His delivery is patient and measured, with a steely intensity that’s unshakeable, as if he’s never been more assured in his path forward.",Rap,8.1
52,"The Philadelphia psych collagists’ new album approaches confusion and terror through some of their prettiest music to date. There are two blood-curdling screams within the first 15 minutes of You’ll Have to Lose Something, the harrowing fifth album from Philadelphia psych-punks Spirit of the Beehive. Neither sits prominently in the mix, so they’re easy to miss amid the shapeshifting structures and shards of shattered noise. The first, wordless and caked in distortion, appears as the bottom falls out of opener “The Disruption,” settling like thick smoke over the rubble of the stoner-rock breakdown. The second, which interrupts the uncanny 1960s pop single “Let the Virgin Drive,” is more forceful, a shredded-throat plea for help that sounds as though it’s wafting up from a basement of horrors.In clammier hands, these moments would be bludgeons or cheap jumpscares, but Spirit of the Beehive weave them into their arrangements with a delicate touch. The way the band writes—stitching discordant sounds into a tangled, anxious whole—feels destabilizing but thoroughly considered, each spiky sample, effects-warped vocal take, or disquieting lyric placed just so. The sense of discomfort feels deliberate and well-earned, reflecting how maddening it feels to wake up and endure all over again. “It exists in everyday life,” band member Zach Schwartz recently told The Fader. “Daily anxieties are part of the human experience.”The band, founded by Schwartz and Rivka Ravede in 2014, started as a shoegaze act, seeking transcendence via pummeling din. By the time they released 2018’s Hypnic Jerks, they’d lowered the decibel level, settling into a mode more Rorschach than Ride. During pandemic lockdown Schwartz and his bandmates traded files to create 2021’s ENTERTAINMENT, DEATH, its hallucinatory and frenetic sprawl mimicking the endless wash of social media and advertising. Schwartz and Ravede, who’d been in a romantic relationship for over a decade, parted ways in 2022, throwing the band’s future into question.You’ll Have to Lose Something (as well as last fall’s EP i’m so lucky) is ostensibly a breakup album, though it’s less a collection of wallowing, where-did-it-go-wrong confessionals than an exploration of the confusion and terror that comes with suddenly entering a new phase of life. In this case, it’s three people trying to work out what it means when a romance, a working relationship, and a friendship simultaneously fail the stress test. In that same Fader interview, multi-instrumentalist Corey Wilchin explains how writing the album helped the trio process its new dynamic: “Collectively, we’re not the most communicative bunch…We’re writing about each other and what we’re going through when we can’t talk about things or don’t want to talk about them.” “Devotion is a cancer,” Ravede sings during the Deerhunter psychedelia of “Stranger Alive.” Once it shifts into a brawny krautrock groove, Schwartz responds, “The path behind you is lit from the side.” There are perspectives and angles only understood in hindsight.",Rock,7.8
53,"On a record of gentler, cozy indie rock, Sarah Tudzin searches for balance while confronting life’s humbling privileges, the heaviness of mourning, and all manner of recent grievances. Criticizing bigwigs at the apex of the music industry seemed to come naturally to Illuminati Hotties. But after a few years of relative success as an artist and in-demand engineer, Sarah Tudzin’s spot might not look half bad to those still beneath her in the power structure, treading out of breath in Los Angeles’ sublevel swamp—and the perspective change is messing with her head. A musical Swiss Army knife, she spends her third album as Illuminati Hotties, Power, grappling with the complicated reality of where she’s at these days: basking in year one of marriage, smoking anxiously at The Met at dawn, and realizing her ADHD is productive until it isn’t. Never mind that her credentials earned her an impressive list of musicians on speed dial for Power—Death Cab for Cutie’s Jason McGerr, Jay Som’s Melina Duterte, Ryan Hemsworth—when she needs to sort through life’s mixed bag of humbling privileges and recent grievances before she can go back to taking shots.Engineering for Boygenius and Weyes Blood during the day and being a self-described “superhuman” musician by night, Tudzin’s relentless lifestyle could make you hyperventilate by proximity alone. “I triple-book my Saturdays, but I pretend my program keeps me from freaking out,” she sings, cross-eyed with stress, on the addictive lead single “Can’t Be Still.” On “The L,” Tudzin admits she can’t help the all-or-nothing grind: “I’m stubborn enough to give it up or give ’em hell.” Three years ago, that looked like cracking jokes and throwing uppercuts on Let Me Do One More to the tune of ricocheting power-pop. But with the gentler indie rock of Power, she forces herself to really, genuinely try to explore the middle ground between hiding under the covers all day and pulling wild all-nighters.Illuminati Hotties’ knack for earworms remains unshakeable, from the shoegaze-inflected guitars in “Throw (Life Raft)” to the lovesick vocal harmonies of “Sleeping In.” Accenturing those hooks are friends in the business: Cavetown joins her ode to giving up (“Didn’t”) and Speedy Ortiz’s Sadie Dupuis helps tackle mental white noise (“What’s the Fuzz”). Tudzin’s most effortless songwriting on Power, however, cozies up in a softer blend of acoustic guitar-led indie pop reminiscent of the early works of Tegan and Sara. Nursing wounds while simultaneously trying to put her problems to scale, Tudzin writes unpretentious songs that aim straight for the heart (“I Would Like, Still Love You,” “You Are Not Who You Were”) like the enduring hits of So Jealous.",Rock,7.5
54,"Bludgeoning rage beats, glitchy sound design, and sideways R&B melodies take on corporal presence in producer and vocalist Chris Taylor’s brilliantly discombobulating debut. It wasn’t that long ago that a casual reference to “LARPing” would instantly get you banished to the dorkiest table at the cafeteria. If only those kids could have known that one day, “side quest” would just as commonly describe a trip to score ketamine as an opportunity to bust out the 20-sided dice. Chris Taylor’s always managed to split the difference, juggling the sleek pop sensibilities of a club-hopper with the type of obsessive engineering that only comes from late nights spent burying your head in software. That contrast lives in his music as Body Meat: Blake-ian vocal hooks get chopped up against mutant MIDI rhythms partway between Nyege Nyege and Nobuo Uematsu, and no cartoonishly obtuse sound is too stiff to loosen up into an elastic excuse to dance.Starchris, Body Meat’s long-awaited full-length debut, makes it seem as if all the various genres and sounds currently percolating through our world might’ve been secretly emanating from his all along. Rage beats tumble into hyperspeed rave-ups; post-SOPHIE sound design squiggles alongside mangled Afrobeats and teeth-gnashing nu-metal. It’s the kind of genre-splitting that’s become a hallmark of hyperpop, but Starchris never comes off like a gimmicky mashup. Instead, Taylor explores what these styles have in common: how competing bass patterns can interlock, the way a slight vocal tic can set up an impending drop, the exact moment when a track pushes the listener from a head nod into a full-body flux, and how to subdivide that sensation even further.As plugged-in as all his fastidiously designed timbres might make him seem, Taylor’s approach is decidedly old-school in spirit. A DIY lifer who cut his teeth in Denver and Philly’s experimental scenes before finally ending up in New York, his music is more of a piece with the underground art-rock of decades past: the Zach Hills and Deerhoofs of this world whose acrobatic musicianship could only be outpaced by their need to deploy it for the silliest purposes imaginable. Throughout Starchris, Taylor decodes the anything-goes outlook of the modern internet addict and brings it hurtling into the real world. On “Crystalize,” after two woozy minutes of plastic psychedelia where Taylor’s buzzy tones seem to be going eight different directions at once, the most surprising moment of all comes when he locks into a straight-ahead 4/4 groove. Layering it with blown-out synths and a marimba arpeggio that would be at home in a Banjo-Kazooie boss fight, Taylor holds just enough reign over his discombobulating ideas to steer them through one thrilling detour after another.",Experimental,8.2
55,"Is the patio a liminal space, a threshold between the known and unknown? Cincinnati artist Alex Cobb’s minimalist ambient-glitch music suggests that it’s definitely a possibility. For nearly two decades, Alex Cobb has been using synthesizers and field recordings to speak to some mysterious alchemy of mist and moonlight. Much of Cobb’s music seems like an attempt to fix landscapes in sound: His broad, graceful tones might suggest the flat expanse of the American Southwest, or pre-dawn light off Maine’s shoreline, or a fern-lined trail in the Columbia Gorge. But in recent years, the Ohio musician and proprietor of the labels Soda Gong and Students of Decay—formerly known as Taiga Remains and now working under the alias Etelin—has been looking closer to home.Cobb recorded 2018’s Hui Terra in stolen moments following the birth of his first child, channeling sounds to match the sleep-deprived psychedelia of new parenthood. Three years later, Frisson sank deeper into quotidian reverie, weaving the sounds of music boxes, kitchen clatter, a cooing toddler, and what might be a racketball game into his pleasantly aimless drifting. Now, on Patio User Manual, Cobb sharpens his focus on domestic rituals and rural spaces, imbuing evocative ambient sketches with the deep colors and abiding mystery of Gregory Crewdson’s enchanted backyards.“All Day Moon” drops us directly into the scene—chirping crickets, twittering birds, the declarative moo of a solitary cow—before Cobb brings up the faders on his synths. Soft, floaty pads strike an atmospheric note; the angled beam of a sharpened lead cuts horizontally, like the late afternoon sun. The whole album tends to linger in a similar mode: calm, bucolic, swirled with muted pastels. Timbres morph like slow-moving cirrus clouds; irregular patterns burble along without ever locking into mechanical repetition. The mood is contemplative but also blissfully Zen-like; subdued yet alert to a world of detail. It’s possible to detect a certain faint wistfulness, if you’re prone to such emotions, but Cobb’s limpid tone poems are never maudlin.Much of the album maintains a conversation with Etelin’s ambient forebears. The glassy bell tones and squiggling filters of “Brown’s Pool Behind the Hammock Tree” are reminiscent of Microstoria’s weird iridescence; the powdery textures and trebly feedback of “The Chemistry of Cobalt” recall Pole and Jan Jelinek. The organ and gentle new-age tones of “Golden Bells Hung From the Plants” might be a nod to Ernest Hood’s 1975 private-press album Neighborhoods, ambient music’s most definitive take on screen doors and lawn sprinklers.In a note accompanying the album, Cobb seems uneasy to submit too easily to the rhapsody of the back porch. “Is it actually possible to flee to the country when you’ve internalized a lifetime of intellectualized urban living?” he asks. “When you buy a DIY patio kit, you get instructions for how best to embed concrete or brick or flagstone into the natural world. The patio will make you enjoy your environment more. It will become yours. You can stand on it and think ‘this is Mine.’” It’s a healthily skeptical perspective, perhaps one that helps keep Patio User Manual from ever tipping into overt sentimentalism.",Electronic,7.2
56,"The Rhode Island songwriter’s ornate, bookish chamber pop has its own brand of whimsy. I have never put on a record because I wanted to think of the Siege of Vienna. I have never closed my eyes and thought of Kahlenberg, the mountain, and known that the Ottomans were closing in. I have never put on a record because I wanted to think of Henry James’ Turn of the Screw. I don’t know why anyone puts on a record. I do know that music often sounds really good when you are in love, and that is a good reason to put on a record. Also, music often sounds really good when you are sad and when you are grieving, and that is a really good reason to put on a record. On his second album, For Every Set of Eyes, J. Mamana considers the Siege of Vienna. He also considers grief. It is a frustrating and beautiful record.Mamana’s music appeals to a bookish set. It asks that you maybe already like Mahler and Bartók. It implies that you might subscribe to the literary journal n+1, where you will find an ad for Mamana’s album in the pages of the newest issue. (Perhaps you will have already read his n+1 essay from last year, about the Ethiopian composer Emahoy Tsege Mariam Gebru.) It is tricky to be so expressly referential in music without being a snore. Mamana’s “It’s Bastille Day,” which is about Bastille Day, includes a particularly jarring François Hollande name-check that doesn’t quite pay off. And For Every Set of Eyes isn’t exactly an easy listen. It demands that you focus and pay attention to how everything swirls together. Somehow, he more or less pulls it off.As was clear from his last record, Nothing New in the West, Mamana is most comfortable writing extraordinarily high-concept songs, some of which are indebted to Beethoven. But his work is also very much in conversation with baroque indie pop composers Koenig and Longstreth. Unlike Longstreth, who wrote a sexy pop song about goblins, or Koenig, who wrote one about eating falafel, Mamana is entrenched in the baroque. He writes impenetrable music that is both deeply rooted in Kabbalah and also about fast food. In “New America,” he sets the Magi and Belshazzar near a Wendy’s. It is kind of like a Van Dyke Parks song, ridiculously ornate, exactly what you would want to hear while riding a cartoon stick horse through Camelot.",Rock,7.4
57,"After a summer of hit singles, Sabrina Carpenter sets a high bar for big pop with a refreshingly light album that’s cheeky, clever, and effortlessly executed. Across the long history of music, love has been likened to every drug under the sun. But on this summer’s intoxicating breakout hit, Sabrina Carpenter claims to be so irresistible that it pushes her lovers to the edge of insomnia. “Is it that sweet? I guess so,” she coos on “Espresso,” eyelash extensions fluttering innocently. “Say you can’t sleep, baby I know, that’s that me espresso.” Her allure is so piping hot that it melts grammar down into something deliciously dumb and maybe genius. Atop a breezy nu-disco beat, Carpenter delivers nonsensical, syntax-shredding lines—“Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya”…“I know I Mountain Dew it for ya”—with the “yoo-hoo” cheek of a Gen Z Betty Boop.“Espresso” and its even more successful follow-up single, “Please Please Please,” launched the 25-year-old Carpenter into a new echelon of pop stardom. It's been a long time coming. She spent her teenage years acting in a spin-off of the sitcom Boy Meets World and she released her first four records under the Disney umbrella. Like many before her, she eventually ditched the mouse ears to drop her first “big girl” album, 2022’s Emails I Can’t Send.So here we are at Carpenter’s sixth album, Short n’ Sweet, a tee-hee title for a 36-minute album by a singer who stands just under five feet tall. In a pop landscape recently plagued by self-seriousness and a tiresome obsession with authenticity, Short n’ Sweet is a refreshing glass of escapism. Rest assured, Carpenter didn’t bunny hop over a vulnerable phase—Emails touched on a number of personal experiences including breakups, parental infidelity, and the fallout from a love triangle involving a certain “driver’s license.” But on Short n’ Sweet, Carpenter is here for a good time. As she establishes on the opening track, “Taste”: “Singin’ ’bout it don’t mean I care.”26 Contenders for the 2024 Song of the SummerAcross 12 tracks, Carpenter plays with some familiar pop guises. There’s sparkly pop-rock (the semi-sapphic “Taste”), Dolly-indebted twang (“Slim Pickins,” “Sharpest Tool”), and at least one throwback R&B steamer (“Good Graces”). Though “Coincidence”’s singalong vibes step a little too close to the folk-pop campfire, Carpenter largely pulls off these stylistic crossovers thanks to a big-ass voice that she wields with ease. It also helps that she’s backed by a who’s-who of pop songwriters and producers. Short n’ Sweet’s primary co-writer is Amy Allen, who has many hits under her belt including four No. 1 songs this year. Other familiar names include Julia Michaels, One Direction mastermind John Ryan, and Ian Kirkpatrick. Jack Antonoff is here too—his sparkly synths are unmistakable on the dazzling “Please Please Please.”",Pop,8.0
58,"A 25th anniversary reissue of the Kansas group’s 1999 breakthrough looks back at a crucial turning point for Midwestern emo—but a dozen demos offer a glimpse of paths not taken. A truly great opening line is rare; the best stick around long after you’ve forgotten the finer details of whatever follows. “In 1984, I was hospitalized for approaching perfection.” “Desperate for changing, starving for truth.” “It’s Britney, bitch.” It’s rarer still to find it from a band whose most successful songs until that point rhymed “you” with, well, “you.” But in 1999, the Get Up Kids were on a mission to break out of their isolated scene in Kansas City. Their second album opens with a pick slide, and then another for good measure, before vocalist Matt Pryor asks a question with the bewilderment of a man in the twilight of his teens: “What became of everyone I used to know?”It’s hard to imagine that album, Something to Write Home About, without its explosive introduction. In an instant, it defines the ethos of so many third-wave emo bands that would form in its wake: adolescent drama stoked into a theatrical wildfire, with layered guitars and Pryor’s pinched, melodic howl as its kindling. But early demos of that song, the electric barnstormer “Holiday,” reveal a shocking alternate universe where the album opens differently: “See you every year and yet we don't embrace.” (There’s also only one pick slide. Yeesh!) On a new reissue of the band’s breakout record, which includes a remaster of the original tracklist as well as a dozen demos from the time of its recording, the Get Up Kids take a roundabout path to pop, achieving emo greatness through careful revision.From their inception, the Get Up Kids were unabashedly ambitious. Pryor had already fronted two failed bands and wasn’t going to risk missing on his third shot at success. Today, an artist might attempt to start a viral TikTok dance to promote their music, but it was 1996, so the Get Up Kids did the only thing they could: They sent demo cassettes to every rock label listed in the pages of Billboard’s Musician’s Guide to Touring and Promotion. The label that responded to their cold submission, Doghouse, might have later inspired one of the blunter anti-label screeds of that decade, but hey, a deal’s a deal.By the following year, the band opened for emo forebears like Braid and Jimmy Eat World and released their full-length debut, Four Minute Mile, recorded (for $4,000, by Shellac bassist Bob Weston) in one weekend so that drummer Ryan Pope wouldn’t miss school. Even if that album had the rawness you might expect from an Electrical Audio disciple—full of tape hiss and unedited live takes, a record that guitarist Jim Suptic would later describe as “a missed opportunity”—the band’s maudlin anxieties and sugary hooks couldn’t help but emerge from the wreckage. After their contract with Doghouse lapsed, they fielded offers from Sub Pop, Geffen, and “probably every major label you can name,” as Ryan put it at the time, and landed on relative newcomer Vagrant. With their own Heroes & Villains imprint and a month of studio time in Los Angeles with producer Chad Blinman on the books, they started piecing together their follow-up.",Rock,7.6
59,"On his new solo album, the Queens rapper tackles his struggles with addiction and intergenerational trauma. His signature mix of smart-dumb humor is still there, but it no longer feels like a security blanket. In 2024—after years of hinting at his struggles in oblique, punny song lyrics and cryptic, quickly deleted tweets—Heems is finally done hiding his trauma. In February, the Punjabi American rapper dropped his first full-length release in eight years, LAFANDAR, rediscovering the joys of rocking up to the mic after years in self-imposed musical exile. VEENA, his second album of the year, takes a clear-eyed look at what dimmed that joy in the first place: the complex PTSD, chemical dependencies, and self-sabotage that dragged him away from the light. Produced almost entirely by Melbourne’s Sid Vashi—whose day job is in psychiatry—this is rap as self-directed therapy.These are not entirely unfamiliar waters. Heems has always interspersed his meta-satirical bars with personal accounts of his experiences with racism in a post-9/11 America. But the struggles that he is processing here aren’t only personal—he’s also tackling the generational trauma left behind by cataclysmic historical events like the 1947 Partition of India and Pakistan, which killed over a million people and turned millions more into refugees overnight. A few decades later, in the 1980s, a separatist insurgency and state repression in the Indian half of Punjab forced tens of thousands to flee the country. In a fractured homeland or as diasporic exiles, everyday Punjabis found themselves living hard lives in hard circumstances.Most of the time, Punjabi families (including mine) don’t like to discuss, or even acknowledge, these psychic wounds. To talk about them is blasphemy, an unseemly airing of dirty laundry. On VEENA, Heems isn’t afraid to go all in. “Only way to process it is write like it’s my mission,” he raps on lead single and album centerpiece “Manto.” The song’s title is a nod to Urdu writer S.H. Manto, the preeminent chronicler of the chaos that accompanied Partition. Over Vijay Iyer’s tender piano keys and a dusty, sepia-tinged beat, Heems raps with an urgency that lands somewhere between the Last Poets’ agitprop spoken verse and ragged punk-rock howl, trying to come to grips with “PTSD for something I didn’t witness.”A lot of VEENA—named after both Heems’ mother and the string instrument associated with the Hindu goddess of knowledge and music—deals with similarly grim subject matter, but it does not wallow in misfortune. Much of the music here is joyous, even exuberant, Vashi gleefully wrangling pop-R&B vocals and lush soul samples next to wavy synths and woozy, propulsive grooves. There are forays into lush, Avalanches-esque plunderphonics and Kollywood-adjacent club rap aimed directly at the hind-brain. Heems raps about surviving addiction and mental health issues with the sort of earnest, unflappable positivity that only comes after a process of painful self-reflection.",Rap,7.6
60,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit the lodestar of independent rap, a 1999 Rawkus mixtape that captured the vital, splintering sound of New York’s underground. From the moment Puff said it, it felt wrong. When the disgraced Bad Boy Entertainment founder rapped, on The Notorious B.I.G.’s “Mo Money Mo Problems,” that “ten years from now, we’ll still be on top,” it was in that flat preening monotone. Hip-hop’s commercial trajectory appeared to be such that he and his peers might keep accumulating yachts, but the dynasty he envisioned never seemed credible. By the time that song was finally released as a single, on July 15, 1997, Big had been dead for more than four months, and Puff’s Police-sampling elegy, “I’ll Be Missing You,” was already a No. 1 hit. In the video for “Mo Money,” when Puff raps the “ten years” line, he’s standing next to Mase in one of those glittering wind tunnels; they flit between different outfits and setups, their shimmying intercut with a team of dancers given slightly more robust choreography. Eventually we see archival footage of Big, presented with all the care and solemnity of the Terminator 2 clips that play as you wait in line at Universal Studios.Big’s assassination left a vacuum in New York hip-hop. Jay-Z and DMX would move to fill it, each succeeding in different ways; even with the Wu-Tang momentum waning, Ghostface was regrouping to prepare for Supreme Clientele; Big Pun was getting acrobatic; underneath all of this, Zev Love X had reemerged, rapping with stockings over his face at the Nuyorican Poets Café as MF DOOM. At every strata, in little venues with sticky floors and yawning boardrooms alike, artists seemed to be competing not only for commercial supremacy, but for the right to drag the genre, and the city, in the creative direction they saw fit.One week after “Mo Money Mo Problems” was issued to radio, Company Flow’s Funcrusher Plus became the first release from an independent label called Rawkus Records. The trio, comprised of rapper-producers El-P and Bigg Jus and DJ Mr. Len, had sold more than 30,000 copies of their 1995 vinyl-only EP Funcrusher without any label support; when Rawkus founders Jarret Myer and Brian Brater approached them with the financial backing of their friend James Murdoch—he of those Murdochs, the Murdoch Murdochs—they felt they’d have the creative latitude they needed to expand Funcrusher into something even more bludgeoning and unsettling. The expanded album opens with a too-sly extended joke about child molestation, then a quip about 2Pac being shot at Quad Studios in 1994 (this being less than a year after Pac was eventually killed in Las Vegas). Funcrusher Plus is often brooding and brutal, El-P’s production ingenious and totalizing. While the majority of its verses are de rigueur battle raps, the album sounds like one particularly grim vision of the future.",Rawkus,8.6
61,"N/A By 1981, the great Throbbing Gristle were finished. The UK quartet—electronics whiz Chris Carter, queer visionary Peter “Sleazy” Christopherson, guitar hero/pocket trumpet enthusiast/sex-and-art-worker Cosey Fanni Tutti, and carnival barker-cum-cult leader Genesis P-Orridge—had swollen the boundaries between punk, psychedelia, disco, and musique concrète. Along the way they’d done what seemed like irreparable damage to each other’s ears, bodies, and hearts. They abruptly ended their tour and sent a transmission to their fan club: The mission was terminated.Then, five years later, they briefly flickered back to life with 1986’s TGCD1. The new-fangled compact disc—the format, launched in 1982, had taken off the year before—came tucked into a typically minimalist package emblazoned with their high-voltage flash symbol and complete with a written note from each of the four players. A new edition from Mute recreates the CD and splits the 42 minutes of studio recordings made on their TEAC 8-track onto two sides of vinyl. At their core, Throbbing Gristle were a jam band, though their idea of hippie dancing might have been stubbing your toe. Much of their ample discography, including the infamous attaché case of 24 cassettes, documented their long, frenzied improvisations. TGCD1 offers a pair of exegeses into classics from their album 20 Jazz Funk Greats. At the time, they might have sounded like autopsies. Today, they sound like a dangerous séance.The first side opens with seven minutes of noise, part cauldron and part plasma globe. There’s foam and fuzz, guitar shards invoking krautrock and Stockhausen and other brownish-gray takes on white noise. Then, with the brutal power of the slow-moving clock at the job you fucking hate, the grinding groove of “What a Day” begins. It goes on like this for the next 13 minutes, going nowhere but moving deeply, a daydream you resent yet need to carry on.The second part launches fully into space, then settles into long orbits around another 20JFG classic, “Convincing People.” P-Orridges’s madman/ad-man vocals are absent. But its 20 minutes sell you on the notion that Throbbing Gristle could have been a dance act, putting out 12"" megamixes for queerdos to find themselves to on the dancefloor. TG could have been Moroder, shooting their sonic wads for Freddie Krueger films instead of soundtracking Derek Jarman art-house experiments. They could have been huge, instead of hugely influential.They didn’t want to, though. They went on to bigger, often better things: Sleazy’s immortal Coil with his lover John Balance, icy-hot electro-pop outfit Chris & Cosey, P-Orridge’s trans-genre provocation engine Psychic TV. (But the former’s ill-fated Hellraiser soundtrack work and the latters’ dancefloor hits and misses proved the world would never really be ready for them.) And then, some 23 years later—and given their occult interest in numerology, that number couldn’t have been an accident—they reactivated again. Three surprisingly vital and viscous albums arrived, each recently reissued by Mute. Even more improbably, they played Coachella and New York City, the later dates with all house lights up so the crowd could be sure they weren’t imagining things. Among the T-shirts and enamel badges at the merch table, they could see something else: a compact disc called The Third Mind Movements.",Electronic,8.0
62,"The Los Angeles duo’s second album is musically and conceptually dense, warping the fundamentally optimistic sound of pop to suit a more cynical and paranoid reality. The setup for Magdalena Bay’s new concept album, Imaginal Disk, begins somewhere that looks like the beginning of 2001: A Space Odyssey, except that co-producers and songwriters Mica Tenenbaum and Matthew Lewin have identified the missing evolutionary link connecting primates to humans: an extraterrestrial LaserDisc, inserted into the forehead. When Tenenbaum’s character, True, comes due for a hardware upgrade, her body rejects it. This next part is a little unclear, but according to the band she must then relearn “what it means to be human.” You’ll want to excuse them for coming up with a YA sci-fi paperback’s worth of shtick when they pull off this whopper of a feghoot in track 11: “Feeling DiskInserted?”Since their inception in 2016, Magdalena Bay have made aqueous internet pop and low-voltage funk full of pinwheeling arpeggios and inside jokes. Imaginal Disk sounds like that, but bigger and punchier—more keyboards! More percussion tracks! Add a string section!! Synth harp!!! The total effect brings to mind ’90s Madchester, the progression of Tame Impala after Lonerism, and peak CD sonics, by which I mean a point in time when record companies were positively rolling in it and backing the production of bangers on the scale of George Michael’s “Freedom! ’90” or New Radicals’ “You Get What You Give”—and the big splashy chorus on Imaginal Disk’s “Death & Romance” sounds not a little like “You Get What You Give.” But as opposed to the traditional big-tent populist come-together anthem, Mag Bay’s project is something like the messy slide of signifiers one encounters scrolling the internet: They warp this fundamentally optimistic musical mode to suit a more cynical and paranoid reality.“I think what would be a positive thing is if we start to be seen less as a pop group and more like an ‘alternative’ group,” Lewin told The Line of Best Fit recently, citing the band’s distance from any actual pop chart. Can’t blame him for not wanting to sign up for a stan army, though I wonder if Mag Bay aren’t also alluding to a bias of marketing demographics that tends to tip feminine-presenting singers—particularly someone like Tenenbaum, whose style resembles Tennis’ Alaina Moore or Gwen Stefani covering Talk Talk—toward “pop.” Modern pop, though, is the perfect setting for Magdalena Bay: candy floss melodies, sticky hooks, and the creeping sense that all is not well—that no one should be capable of maintaining such shiny happy sincerity in public without some kind of nefarious brain-swap operation happening behind the scenes.",Pop,7.7
63,"The New York rapper-producer’s fluttering hi-hats soundtracked the summer of sexy drill. His new LP stamps the moment by doubling down on his city-specific sexcapades. PLAY CASH COBAIN, the new full-length erotica from Queens horndog Cash Cobain, may have the most mentions of pussy eating of any album in existence. Honestly, what else could you want? Cash, a rapper and producer, is one half of the duo (with Chow Lee) who made 2 Slizzy 2 Sexy, a 2022 mixtape that loaded familiar samples into the club-drill blender, slurring melodies and generating too many deranged, pornographic punchlines to keep track of. That project was provocative, fun as hell, and hyper-fixated on the five boroughs and Long Island, coming at a time when a lighter, lower-stakes alternative to NYC drill—increasingly defined by death, jail, and opportunism—was needed.Fast forward to 2024 and somehow, those roots have bloomed into an entire subgenre that I have reluctantly accepted will be remembered as “sexy drill,” a fusion of New York drill, Jersey club, and player R&B like Brent Faiyaz and PND. Damn near every week it feels like there’s a new rapper in the towns or from out of state riding the wave started by Cash. The excess supply has watered down the sound a bit, but I can’t say I’m ever mad to hear his producer tag: “This beat from Cash not from YouTube.” Actually, I can barely remember a day in New York this summer where I didn’t catch one of his freak-a-thons blasting in the wild. There was “Dunk Contest,” a breezy shoutout fest to all the real-life girls he’s thirsting after—it’s dirty but also kind of sweet. Also “Fisherrr,” a lush back-and-forth with Queens’ Bay Swag that manages to pay homage to Black New York (“And yo’ ass fat, know you eat your rice and your cabbage too”) while remaining so relentlessly horny. And “Rump Punch,” a seductive groove that sounds like having a drunk, sloppy grind session at the West Indian Day Parade. All three singles are on PLAY CASH COBAIN, a 19-song test of endurance that effectively stamps this summertime moment by doubling down on his city-specific sexcapades.Sidestepping the open arms of mainstream rap, Cash takes the album in an intimate and moody direction. His tequila-breathed, speak-sing serenades make me think of Future songs where it feels like he’s stuck in a loop of club nights and one night stands that only leave him more empty. Cash is having those same types of nights, except less lavish, and when he leaves the next morning he’s caught in an obsessive sexual tryst like Body Heat. “When your friends ask who your nigga I just hope you mention me/And whenever I’m not with you I just hope you missing me,” he sings on the featherweight “wassup wya,” completely infatuated. On “Turks (I Apologize),” it’s as if he’s whispering a combination of dirty talk and promises he probably won’t keep in the ear of the woman he’s trying to win over. That’s true of the sultry second half of “cantsleep/drunkinluv,” too, where he begs, “Baby tell me when you’re pullin’ up/Or I can come pick you up/Or I can send a black truck,” like he can’t live without her. Seconds later, in a near-falsetto, he admits what it’s really all about: “I’m in love with your fat butt/In ’n’ out til’ I get that nut/In ’n’ out til’ I make her cum, like damn.”",Rap,7.7
64,"On its second album, the Bay Area band adds surrealist detours and melodic reflections to its snarling, witty post-punk. When she was 18, Hannah D’Amato auditioned for a spot at the Berklee College of Music. Midway through her audition, one of the male judges walked up to her guitar amp and lowered the volume knob. Demoralized and insulted, D’Amato decided to bypass the prestigious institution and start a band on her own. Thus the origin story of Fake Fruit, the Bay Area punk trio she’s been fronting over several incarnations since 2016.That sense of defiance courses through the band’s second album, and first for Carpark, Mucho Mistrust. In 12 tightly wound tracks, D’Amato and her bandmates, drummer Miles MacDiarmid and guitarist Alex Post, forge a rickety bridge between the righteous indignation of riot grrrl and the staccato unease of the UK’s post-punk revivalists. D’Amato’s plainspoken delivery and sneering wit provide the record’s center of gravity, as she monologues about a shitty ex (“You’ve got punisher’s lust/I’ve got mucho mistrust,” she quips in the title track), reckons with dwindling self-worth (“Well Song”), and bids adieu to a slimy narcissist who “made me look psycho” (“Psycho”).The album takes its name from a Blondie classic, but the nervy outbursts of “Psycho” and squawking, sax-addled no wave of “Gotta Meet You” have more in common with the paranoid racket of Bush Tetras. You could certainly draw a throughline between that group’s underground hit “Too Many Creeps” and the lyrical concerns of Fake Fruit, which prominently include scummy men, toxic romances, and the myriad ways humans can exploit one another. D’Amato, who left an unhappy relationship before making Mucho Mistrust, surveys these frustrations with such bluntness that listening to Fake Fruit often feels like overhearing one end of a heated phone call. “Who taught you to behave this way?” she asks at the start of “See It That Way,” opening the record in media res as dueling guitars snarl from one speaker to the other.But there are also surrealist detours—the wacky sprechgesang of “Venetian Blinds,” written and sung by Post, lightens the mood—and tracks that move in a more reflective direction. In the latter category, “Cause of Death” is strikingly good. Evoking the confounding mindfuck of an obsessive crush, the track slows and shifts keys midway through as the band rides out a dramatic refrain against a swelling choir of backup voices. It is the most moving and melodic Fake Fruit song to date, and it tees up the mood for “Sap,” the closest thing to a ballad on here, its mellow chords scuffed up just enough to let the bitterness seep through.Because of their talky vocals and post-punk lineage, and because they toured with Dry Cleaning in 2022, Fake Fruit could conceivably be slotted in with the UK’s vibrant cohort of talk-singing post-punk upstarts. But D’Amato’s vocals carry a distinctly American strain of directness—and unapologetic angst—that contrasts with the cryptic musings of, say, Florence Shaw. On “Más o Menos,” her sarcastic refrain—“I hope you had a good time on your sympathy tour/Hope you found everything that you were looking for”—even evokes Olivia Rodrigo’s breakup kiss-offs. There is detached cool in free-associative poetry, but there’s also power in saying what you mean and saying it loudly, Berklee admission committees be damned.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

65,"On its fourth album, the Irish group trades steely post-punk for stadium-sized alt rock with a hefty dose of Y2K nostalgia. It’s an unexpected shift, but they handle it with panache. On Fontaines D.C.’s panic-attack-inspired 2024 single “Starburster,” frontman Grian Chatten searches desperately for unfiltered certainty. “I wanna take the truth without a lens on it/My god-given insanity depends on it,” he sings, buried amid crunchy boom-bap beats and wheezing Mellotron. The song’s cryptic video—and its ominous parade of gimp masks, albuterol hits, and reconstructive surgery—only underscores the sense that the Irish group, once famous for its studied cool, might be going off the rails.Where Fontaines D.C.’s 2022 album Skinty Fia bid a tenebrous farewell to the band’s Dublin origins, on Romance they embrace their transformation into globe-trotting rock stars. Having evolved from the pints, poetry, and working-class grit of their roots, they’ve traded longtime collaborator Dan Carey (Squid, Black Midi) for producer James Ford, known for his work with arena-scale bands like Arctic Monkeys, Gorillaz, and Depeche Mode; they’ve replaced the raw post-punk of Dogrel and A Hero’s Death with a Frankenstein assemblage of Britpop, gothic Americana, and ’90s alt rock. (They’ve updated their outfits, too, with new looks that suggest Harmony Korine styling the Spice Girls.) Are they having an identity crisis, or playing with their newfound fame? Excitingly, it’s a bit of both. Romance maintains the darkness integral to Fontaines D.C.’s music while showcasing a frisky unpredictability.Romance opens with a feeling of limitless possibility framed against a backdrop of impending doom. The ominous title track feels like a death march: Its piano melody teeters between innocence and occult, accompanied by brooding fuzz guitar and percussion that sounds like it was recorded in a damp cave. “Maybe romance is a place,” Chatten sings seductively: “For me/And you.” What follows is similarly sprawling and surrealistic, combining the Cure’s haunting sweetness with the Pixies’ nightmarish edge. Opulent string arrangements conjure the ghosts of classic cinema, then give way to a darkly Western influence.Chatten sounds more vibrant than ever, exuding the starry-eyed curiosity of a traveler exploring a new city. From his jittery breathing and soulful crooning on “Starburster” to the urgent falsetto and seductive sighs of “Here’s the Thing” to a weepy head voice on “Desire,” his newfound range is remarkable, and so is the band’s. On “In the Modern World,” they channel the dreamy tones of Lana Del Rey’s “Sad Girl” and the Smashing Pumpkins’ “Tonight, Tonight.” On “Death Kink,” Chatten’s voice shifts between narcotized and menacing as he unspools lyrics like a round of exquisite corpse: “I live meretricious/You shattered/Amazing stars from the drink.”",Rock,7.7
66,"The intuitive bond between the two musicians remains at the forefront of their terrific new album, full of quiet adventures and clear empathy. Woodland, the first collection of original material jointly billed to lifelong collaborators Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, takes its name from the East Nashville studio the pair have owned since 2001. Central to the duo’s creative life, Woodland Studios is where Welch and Rawlings write and record the music they issue under a variety of guises—they’ve only recently started sharing above-the-title credit, after years of alternating between Welch solo affairs and such projects as Dave Rawlings Machine—through their Acony imprint. It was nearly lost in the devastating tornadoes that swept through Nashville in March of 2020, ripping the roof off the studio and forcing Welch and Rawlings to rescue all their master tapes and gear in the middle of the storm.They managed to salvage everything, yet the building itself required extensive repairs, a project that continues to this day. As they rebuilt, Welch and Rawlings continued to create music, first regrouping with All the Good Times (Are Past & Gone), a Grammy-winning collection of folk and country covers cut in their living room, then writing the songs that form Woodland.Names may be fungible in the duo’s universe, but they’re meaningful. Here, the shared billing highlights the way that Welch and Rawlings are intertwined throughout Woodland, acting as one as they sing harmonies and trade leads. The way the pair weave their voices is one of the reasons Woodland doesn’t sound nearly as spartan as albums like 2011’s The Harrow & the Harvest. There’s a palpable warmth to their interplay that extends to the recording itself. Grateful to have their home turf survive, they’ve taken advantage of the full potential of a recording studio. As Welch told Stephen Deusner in Uncut, “We were so relieved that the studio still existed, so we had an amplified desire to really use it.”Hardly a renunciation of the plaintive folk that’s been their signature for years, Woodland does find Welch and Rawlings taking advantage of the possibilities of a recording studio, expanding their austere acoustics with other shades. Some of these colors are nuanced, such as hints of organ and pedal steel that add dimension to vocal harmonies. Other arrangements that announce themselves quite clearly, such as the introduction of a string section or the presence of a rhythm section for the first time on a Welch and Rawlings project since Soul Journey in 2003. The drums and bass don’t provide a thick backbeat but rather a steady pulse, deepening the connection between the duo and their supporting musicians.",Folk,8.0
67,"A bold, bright sound dominates the band’s third album, in which moments of emotional overload lead to some of their biggest, most ambitious pop songs yet. “One of the craziest things about getting older,” Charly Bliss singer Eva Hendricks has said, “is growing away from the things you did when you were young(er) and stupid(er).” Over the band’s past two albums and a handful of EPs, Hendricks has astutely chronicled those young, stupid experiences: falling in love with a jerk, getting dumped on your birthday, running yourself ragged with youthful ambition. Forever, the Brooklyn band’s third album, pulls off an impressive feat: In some of their biggest, most ambitious pop songs, they tap into those moments of emotional overload while infusing them with the sense of perspective that’s gained from growing up a little.On their first two albums, Charly Bliss balanced sweetness and angst, even as their sound turned from the tightly coiled pop-rock of their debut toward the moody, new-wave synth pop of its follow-up. Hendricks has often mentioned the Josie and the Pussycats soundtrack as a key inspiration, and there’s more than a little Letters to Cleo and the Breeders in Charly Bliss’ DNA. Forever doesn’t sacrifice grit but a bold, bright pop sound dominates. The serrated guitars of “I Don’t Know Anything” and “I’m Not Dead” are a throughline to the band’s indie-rock roots. But squint, and the sparkling “Back There Now” and slow-burning “Here Comes the Darkness” aren’t far off from Carly Rae Jepsen B-sides; the chorus of the explosive “Calling You Out” aims for stadium rafters. Hendricks’ self-examination, too, is heightened—and alongside self-incriminating songs about delusional crushes (“Tragic”) and picking senseless fights with your lover (“Calling You Out”), there are odes to the joys of new love (“Last First Kiss”) and even to the love shared among her bandmates (“Waiting For You”).Hendricks is perhaps funniest when singing about approaching adulthood while being a touring indie musician. On “I Don’t Know Anything,” she wonders what it means to sell out, about whether “as ’90s rock revivalists/We’re just too late.” It’s not exactly a ubiquitous problem, but she knows how to make it universal: When she sings, “You bet on yourself and you lose every day,” it might resonate with any strivers and dreamers staring down a potential global recession, not just the ones waiting on measly Spotify payouts. On the swaying “I’m Not Dead,” Hendricks sings jealously of her boyfriend’s septuagenarian dad: “His life’s more fun and more fulfilling than mine,” she sighs. “If I’m a rockstar, I’m not doing it right.” But she turns hopeful in the chorus, as the whole band cranks up a classic loud-quiet dynamic to cathartic effect. Maybe at the end, she’ll wish she’d “fucked up at least twice as much and had like double the fun”—but hey, as the song’s title argues, at least we’ve still got time.",Rock,7.8
68,"The British singer-songwriter’s third album embraces a daring, inventive production style that highlights the soulful power of her voice. Even in the midst of slippery, unpredictable production, Rosie Lowe’s voice has always been the most undeniable force in her music. The English artist’s melodic inclinations are front and center on her early alt-R&B and soul albums, 2016’s Control and 2019’s YU, and collaborations, like her stunning 2021 album with Duval Timothy, Son. On Lowe’s third solo studio album, Lover, Other, she channels the raw immediacy of Son into even bolder explorations. While Rosie will always wow with the sheer beauty of her voice, here, perhaps for the first time, she’s crafted an album that rides off the strength of its sterling, restless, and inventive production.Lover, Other conveys a sense of emotional directness in its lyrics. Lowe is at times confident, braggadocious, and completely convinced that she is the shit. Elsewhere, though—oftentimes immediately after these uplifting moments—Lowe retreats into a shell, unsure of her worth, purpose, and relationship to others. On “Mood to Make Love,” Lowe tantalizingly croons over a perfectly dusty bassline and barely-there percussion, singing, “Bet you never met a girl like me/Never knew how tough I’d be/Walked out the sea dripping gold.” It’s on that last word that Lowe throws in a number of vocal layers, giving the proclamation a shimmering spotlight. On the very next track, “In My Head,” the drums are grooving and the bassline recalls the soul-funk of fellow UK chameleons SAULT. Lowe, however, is decidedly less grounded than moments before: “I was in my head/Couldn't get it out/Be such a shame/If I could be without,” she sings.The album’s production, which Lowe handled alongside Harvey Grant and D’Monk, mirrors the constantly shifting self-reflection in the lyrics. Lowe wanted to record in a way that was unencumbered by complex recording setups, so she took a miniature mobile studio across Europe and visited collaborators, heading to Florence, Berlin, Barcelona, and her hometown of Devon. It results in a certain level of playfulness and sonic variety across the album, like on the love song “Walk In The Park,” where an affected old Rhodes pops up to say hello. The latter half of the record is decidedly less formal than the former, with Lowe untethering her voice from beats and verse-chorus structure, choosing instead to wash her voice in vocoders (“Don’t Go”) and minimal arrangements consisting of simple drum beats and bass lines that move in and out of the rhythmic pocket.It’s in these looser compositions that Lowe’s production truly shines. Outside the main vocal melody of “Out of You,” the song is rich with the sound of static rain, breathy horn textures, and chopped vocal squawks. “Lay Me” begins with multiple vocal lines floating over a piano groove before shifting into a neo-soul song in conversation with the Soulquarians; its percussion—a brushed snare drum and a floor tom-like sound so loose it’s as if the head is barely on the instrument—emphasizes Lowe’s exacting vision as a producer. Elsewhere, Lowe flexes her pop muscles, like in the clever interactions between clicking percussion, swishing hi hats, a walking bassline, and Rosie’s rich vocal textures on “Gratitudes.” Lowe has created something daring and unwavering in Lover, Other. In using her most provocative production to date, she doesn’t dim the shine of her primary instrument—instead, she highlights its brilliance.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

69,"N/A Late last April at a small German beer hall in Queens filled with steins and bolo ties, Charley Crockett took the stage to celebrate the release of $10 Cowboy. Backed by the Blue Drifters, his trusty band by way of Austin, Texas, he played a style of music he calls “Gulf & Western,” an amalgamation of the blues, folk, soul, and country influences he absorbed growing up between South Texas, Dallas, and New Orleans. The New York crowd—unmistakably full of belt-buckled transplants—was captivated, only looking away to two-step. But one look at the man himself and it was clear: Charley Crockett is tired.At the pace he works, it’d be hard not to be. $10 Cowboy and its recent sequel, Visions of Dallas, mark his 15th album since 2015 and his ninth since 2020. Before that, Crockett spent roughly a decade busking across the northern hemisphere. In New Orleans, he learned traditional street songs and was introduced to the hobo lifestyle; in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, he played honky tonks and street corners alongside Leon Bridges and Vincent Neil Emerson. There were stints in Paris, Copenhagen, Morocco, California, and New York City, where he and his folk-meets-hip-hop group the Train Robbers were discovered performing on a subway car by a music industry executive. Their new manager aspired to take the Train Robbers mainstream; Crockett had other ideas, heading to Northern California to work on a weed farm (and traffic pounds of it) until their contract expired.Risky as this move was, it allowed Crockett the time and independence to concoct a vintage country sound that still manages to be forward-thinking. The core of his music pays homage to old-school outlaws—Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, and James Hand—but more elastic artists like T-Bone Walker and Link Wray play a role too, attributing to his boogie-woogie and rock‘n’roll tendencies. Crockett’s mix of genres initially confused some country purists, but these roots-driven sensibilities have now situated him alongside contemporary stars like Tyler Childers, Colter Wall, and Sierra Ferrell who are moving the genre forward by looking back. With the $10 Cowboy series, Crockett not only cements that he is one of the most prolific artists in the business, but that he is one of the most consistent, too.Chapter I, the stronger of the two releases, features one of Crockett’s most personal and well-executed ballads to date, “Good at Losing,” a solemn ride-along through the years he spent traveling aimlessly. The title track, “$10 Cowboy,” is another highlight: a slow burner that traces the similarities between cowboy singers and bull-riders, quixotic showmen eking out an existence on the outskirts of society. This feeling, a desire to be seen but a refusal to be known, runs strong through Chapter I. Crockett takes the role of a lonesome traveler who, despite getting kicked around time and time again, continues to stride towards the blurry paradise he believes America still has to offer.",Folk,7.5
70,"Post Malone’s first bona fide country album captures the sound of mainstream Nashville, made with a little help from Dolly Parton, Tim McGraw, Luke Combs, and many more. Is country a lifestyle or an accessory? Depends on who you ask. Presently it’s fashionable to try and bridge that gap. Blue-state dwellers with email jobs are dressing up like duck hunters, donning Carhartt and Realtree camo to the warehouse rave or wine bar. Costumed as a rodeo queen, Beyoncé waved the stars and stripes on the cover of her country album earlier this spring. In the video for July’s “Tough,” Quavo rocked cutoffs and an A-frame, play-acting homestead fantasies with Lana Del Rey as she extolled the virtues of being tough as leather boots. Despite Spotify’s best efforts to fill any idle moment with “That’s that me espresso,” the song of the summer is Shaboozey’s country-fried flip of an old ringtone rap hit. “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” an ode to drowning your 9-to-5 sorrows with double shots of Jack, has spent the past five weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100. Currently just behind it is “I Had Some Help,” another twangy drinkin’ anthem, this one by Morgan Wallen and Post Malone.With frizzy braids, glazed eyes and a debut single called “White Iverson,” Post Malone emerged in 2015 as a reflection of the zeitgeist, echoing the slurry melodies of exquisitely medicated rappers. Post spent his teenage years in the Dallas suburbs, playing guitar in hardcore bands and rapping over bedroom beats. The 19-year-old’s first SoundCloud upload racked up a million plays in a month, though he looked a little goofy in the “White Iverson” video dabbing on the hood of a rented Rolls Royce. “I’m not a rapper,” he insisted in a 2016 profile, calling genre a restrictive, dated notion, but rappers were always saying things like that. A few months after his breakthrough, Post tweeted late one night: “WHEN I TURN 30 IM BECOMING A COUNTRY/FOLK SINGER.”As it turns out, F-1 Trillion, Post Malone’s first country album, arrives early in his 29th year, born as he was on the 4th of July. The months prior unfolded like an elaborate debutante ball: In a pearl-snap shirt and bootcut jeans he made his Stagecoach premiere in April, introducing himself by his government name (Austin Richard Post) before a set of country covers heavy on ’90s hits. Emerging from the crowd at CMA Fest in June, he joined Wallen to perform their new duet—a song as rotely catchy as anything on the Tennessee titan’s One Thing at a Time, the biggest album of 2023. “Welcome to country music, Post Malone!” Blake Shelton crowed as the pair debuted “Pour Me a Drink,” F-1 Trillion’s second single, beaming at each other all the while. The song was nothing crazy—your standard fare on the redemptive powers of cracking a cold one—but Post looked as happy as you’d ever seen him, taking off his camo cap to accept the wild applause.",Folk,7.0
71,"Collaborating with drummer Ryan Jewell and saxophonist Cole Pulice, the pedal steel player steers into triumphant post-rock territory on his most surprising and exploratory album yet. The pedal steel guitar, a staple of country music, is inexorably associated with one of the instrument’s most alluring qualities: its ability, within the confines of a pop song lasting just a few minutes, to conjure the open skies and endless spaces so crucial to the mythology of the American West. If you’re going to claim the pedal steel as your primary instrument, especially in ambient music, you’re faced with the choice either to lean into those associations or resist them. On his new studio album Sun Glories, Chuck Johnson unapologetically chooses the latter.This is the most restless, exploratory album thus far from the Oakland guitarist, who started out on acoustic before giving steel the starring role on 2017’s Balsams. A lot of ambient artists are embracing the pedal steel right now, from the contemplative West Coast duo North Americans to the explicitly countrified SUSS, but none are quite as willing to jettison the instrument’s readymade associations as Johnson. He has more in common with the ambient techno stalwart Polmo Polpo (aka Sandro Perri), who used a lap steel to kick up clouds of shoegaze dust.The range of Johnson’s vision is most apparent on the two absolutely titanic tracks that bookend Sun Glories. “Teleos” at first sounds like nondescript pedalboard soup until it gradually assembles itself into a six-note riff. Then the real surprise: Drummer Ryan Jewell enters with a massive fill, elevating the song into the kind of uplifting post-rock that’s often associated with sports and athletics—recall Explosions in the Sky’s Friday Night Lights, the 2010 Olympic ads with the xx’s “Intro,” or countless GoPro videos scored by the amped-up downtempo of Tycho and Ratatat. “Broken Spectre,” which comes at the end, follows a similar structure of beatless rumination followed by the triumphant appearance of Jewell and subsequent fireworks.It’s a good sound for Johnson, not least because it allows him to color so far outside the country box to which steel players are so often confined. The four tracks in between hover at a lower altitude, continuing the almost chamber-music approach of 2021’s The Cinder Grove, in which Johnson used his instrument as a textural bed while organs and strings danced freely at the front of the mix. These are less distinctive, notable mostly for whatever instrument Johnson duets with: a string section on “Ground Wave,” a throbbing organ on “Superior Mirage” that’s suggestive of My Bloody Valentine’s all-build-no-release classic “Is This and Yes.”",Experimental,7.3
72,"Guitarist Steve Marion does not, in fact, sing a note on this tenderly executed albeit bland collection of lounge-act covers and originals. Steve Marion’s songs have always been a little too interesting to dismiss as background music. Guided by the cheerful searchlight of his guitar, the vibrant, dependably eccentric instrumentals that Marion has released as Delicate Steve walk a fine line: Even at their most mellow, his songs court your full attention.On Delicate Steve Sings, though, Marion’s songs have finally faded into musical wallpaper. With its tongue-in-cheek title and smattering of cover songs, the record gestures at classic collections of reimagined standards like Chet Baker Sings or Stardust (which Marion cites as an influence). But Delicate Steve Sings falls short of meeting the genre on its own terms, trying on the smooth lounge act trappings without really committing to the bit. What emerges is a clean but uninspired display case for his prodigious talents, a collection of—how else to put it?—easy listening instrumentals that more often than not feel bland.The covers, which comprise a third or so of the album, aren’t bona fide songbook standards but more recent tunes, like Otis Redding’s “These Arms of Mine” and Donnie and Joe Emerson’s “Baby.” Marion’s versions are tenderly executed, full of lyrical phrasings and quivering vibrato, though yawningly deferential on the whole—more Delicate Steve sings karaoke than Willie sings Irving Berlin. No matter how proficiently it’s performed, a straight-laced instrumental Beatles cover is going to sound like Muzak. Not even Marion’s crystalline touch can distinguish his rendition of “Yesterday” from the versions piping into hotel lobbies.The album’s originals aim for the same sepia-tinted austerity as the remakes, as if Marion wanted them to feel like lost R&B classics you can’t quite place. “Cherry” sounds like a repurposed Motown B-side that gropes at your heart without ever really touching it, part Marvin Gaye and part M*A*S*H. “Medieval Eyes” fares slightly better, with twanging guitars that echo in and out of frame as Marion winds his way through a shuffling drum beat. But for the most part, Marion’s guitar traipses across terrain that’s simply too sparse, abandoning the smoky atmospherics and Afrobeat dreamscapes that have textured his previous work.Light flashes through the gray in the moments when Marion drops the tight-lipped lounge singer act and settles into his own creative voice, as on the album’s high point “I’ll Be There.” Backlit by loping bongos and steadily building strings, Marion activates the choice beach-bum riffing that has marked the best of his recent output. The drums ripple, the violins swell, and Marion’s guitar sings more forcefully than anywhere else on the album. Finally—a song better suited for car rides than elevator rides. It seems to belong to a different Delicate Steve record entirely.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

73,"The South Korean shoegazer’s surprise new release would be called a “back to basics” album if Parannoul had ever once sounded like a typical rock band. The harshest critic of Parannoul’s music happens to be the person who makes it. Just read the quotes the anonymous Seoul artist posts to their Bandcamp page: “I think these are some kind of magic, that will shine bright for a while and then lights out, like nothing happened”; “He believes he is talented…his singing skills are fucking awful, and is below average in height and appearance and everything.” Even as they’ve emerged as a figurehead of South Korean indie rock and a leading light in an exploding online shoegaze scene, Parannoul are imagining backlash. Though 2023’s After the Magic upgraded their blown-out, lower-than-lo-fi digital shoegaze with stunning results, Sky Hundred trades that deep blue for scorching red—a loud-as-fuck rock record that would be called “back to basics” if Parannoul had ever once sounded like a typical rock band.In contrast to its lush and collaborative predecessor, Sky Hundred is credited entirely to Parannoul. Guitars strum slightly out of time, drums tumble in imperfect rhythms, and on “암​전​고​백 (Lights Off Repentance),” Parannoul play at approximately twice their typical tempo, working up a folk-punk froth that resembles In the Aeroplane Over the Sea way more than Loveless. Is Parannoul working on MIDI with next-generation humanizer settings or were they able to play all of these analog instruments in isolation? Not that Sky Hundred is exactly organic; the “piano” motif on “시계 (Backwards)” is reminiscent of a Skype ringtone. But whereas previous Parannoul songs added or removed layers, Sky Hundred works in dynamics. The opening “주​마​등 (A Lot Can Happen)” breathlessly tries to keep up as the tempo shifts to a breakneck IDM beat. Even if the 14-minute centerpiece “Evoke Me” was spliced together in Pro Tools, the raw elements sound culled from hours of real-time jamming.For all of its tweaks, Sky Hundred is immediately “Parannoul music,” its constituent influences welded together by volume. Shoegaze still has the best claim to an album that uses this much guitar distortion, though in contrast to contemporary gossamer and gauze, Sky Hundred is defined by its presence; the guitars punch rather than soothe and the melodies have the definition of a soda jingle. Though the occasional glimmers of twinkling MIDI guitar that situated To See the Next Part of the Dream in emo’s fifth wave are gone, the spirit of the genre remains in Parannoul’s lyrics, which express countless variations on digital sentimentalism. “Even after everything, I want to believe the feeling lasts forever” (“주​마​등 [A Lot Can Happen]”) or “In the beautiful world I dreamt of, there is no story of me” (“환상 [Fantasy]”) would be the most potent distillation of Parannoul’s POV if it weren’t for the chorus of the aching “황​금​빛 강 (Gold River)”: “I remember memories of memories.”",Rock,7.9
74,"The New Jersey hardcore band returns with a five-song EP that keeps the unrelenting ferocity of their early work and adds bolder production and deeper hooks. In the roughly year and a half since Only Constant, Gel barely came up for air. The New Jersey hardcore punks scooped up new drummer Alex Salter, toured nonstop, and signed to a new record label, Blue Grape. Life was so busy that Gel had to wedge themselves into a remote cabin to hash out new songs before their tour schedule swallowed them whole. Once there, they heeded the advice that closed out Only Constant: “Navigate boldly, act with intent.” Those sessions birthed a five-song EP, Persona, that’s bigger and bolder than anything they’ve recorded before. But in true Gel fashion, the freaks are top of mind.Recorded over two weeks and inspired by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung’s concept of the shadow self, singer Sami Kaiser digs up the repulsive, unflattering parts of their own subconscious with an honesty that verges on self-punishment; the title track’s threat (“Don’t forget your fucking place”) sounds as much like an indictment of frauds as it does a self-reminder. To further enhance that, the band approaches the definitive Gel aggression with newfound musical aplomb. Kaiser’s bellows foam with spittle, as if the greed and conceit they’re lambasting is contagious. For guitarist Anthony Webster, it takes shape in guitar tones modeled after Obituary and Swervedriver. Both bassist Mathew Bobko and guitarist Maddi Nave bet on tried-and-true punk without shying away from melody. Even Salter tightens his drumming so the opening, isolated quarter notes of “Mirage” hit as hard as the D-beat barrage in “Martyr.”EP highlight “Shame” represents Gel’s most notable growth with an embrace of studio production. The old metrics for “selling out” in the ’90s, long since expired in the punk world, are slowly draining out of the hardcore community, too; these days, fans bicker over studio-grade gloss in Discord chats but still buy tickets for the show. Gel navigate the leveling-up process on Persona like their hometown heroes Thursday or My Chemical Romance did before them by hiring a producer who understands their ambitions. Jon Markson (Drug Church, Drain) is a steady hand at Gel’s mixing console, turning up the volume as bridges build and drawing out individual members’ parts for efficient contrast that doesn’t feel too clean.Throughout Persona, Gel retain their menacing power not in spite of the production, but in concert with it. Markson whittles Webster and Nave’s guitar riffs into sharp prongs until they interlace like zipper teeth. Salter’s drum hits pummel with the energy of a raucous basement set that’s properly mic’d. Even when Kaiser’s venomous yells border on actual singing, like in the alt-rock chorus of “Shame,” Markson never goes heavy on reverb.",Rock,7.8
75,"Panda Bear dreamed for years of hearing his songs played by a Mexican mariachi group. He finally gets his chance. Like oddball Taylor Swifts scrabbling for indie chart position, Panda Bear and Sonic Boom have unleashed a fifth iteration of their excellent 2022 album Reset: Reset Mariachi EP follows Reset in Dub, Reset (Songbook Instrumentals + Remixes), and an actual, honest-to-goodness Reset Songbook, featuring the songs’ sheet music. Excessive? Perhaps a little. But it’s hard to argue with vision. The duo originally wanted to record with a mariachi band on “Tropic of Cancer,” for Panda Bear’s 2015 album Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper, which Sonic Boom co-produced. But the idea remained a pipe dream until the duo were booked for a show in Mexico in 2023, leading to a recording session with Mexico City band Mariachi 2000 de Cutberto Pérez.Few albums merit the remake treatment as much as Reset, a fascinating excursion into 1950s pop and child-friendly melodies that sound simultaneously innocent and suspiciously narcotic, a record both hard to pin down in its unusual combinations yet refreshingly straightforward in its clean melodic lines and two-chord loops. That simplicity makes Reset an unusually malleable record—a Lego set for inventive minds.ResetThe original “Danger” made compelling use of its dreamy acoustic guitar, handclaps, and Everly Brothers sample; it shone as a left-field reggae number when remixed by Adrian Sherwood as “Danger Dub”; and it resonates with cinematic romance as “Peligro,” thanks to the glistening strings and floral trumpets of Mariachi 2000 de Cutberto Pérez. The song’s transformation is complete when the Mexico City band’s vocalists replace Panda Bear’s slightly reedy Spanish-language singing with their rich, full-bodied voices on a second version of the song.Reset’s “Livin’ in the After” is a more obvious candidate for the Cutberto Pérez treatment, its swooping string line—sampled from the Drifters’ 1960 single “Save the Last Dance for Me”—tinted with the elegant drama associated with mariachi music. (Although the Mexican musicians were apparently bemused by the simplicity of Panda Bear and Sonic Boom’s songs, so perhaps we shouldn’t make too much of this apparent similarity.) Whatever the case, Mariachi 2000 keep the original song’s instrumentation largely in place but amp up the party vibes, adding layers of ambient chatter, supporting voices, and a jubilant trumpet line, yielding one of the most vibrant good-time songs I’ve heard in a long while.After passing through Reset and Reset in Dub, “Livin’ in the After” may have found its definitive version as the profoundly joyous “Viviendo en las sequelas,” especially when voiced with respectful gravity by the collected singers of Mariachi 2000. The philosophical listener might take a moment to consider the powerfully universal language of music that has taken this song, forged in Portugal by musicians from Baltimore and Rugby, England, all the way to Mexico City. But the best reaction is surely to dance, grin, and hit rewind.",Electronic,7.6
76,"A new reissue of a 1975 Berlin organ performance rescues an overlooked masterpiece of early ambient music. In its crystalline churns, conventional timekeeping melts away. Terry Riley wanted to disrupt the flow of time. The budding composer had spent a few years experimenting with tape loops and Echoplex delay units back in the Bay Area, where he was part of the San Francisco Tape Music Center alongside fellow mavericks Morton Subotnick, Ramón Sender, and Pauline Oliveros. In 1963, Riley went to Paris, where he moonlighted as a nightclub pianist and composed music for The Gift, an experimental theater piece by American performance artist Ken Dewey. Working with Chet Baker and his band, Riley recorded each player separately in order to manipulate their parts, in an early form of remixing; he asked a studio engineer if it would be possible to create a looping delay, imagining a sound that might build up “magically.”The engineer’s solution was to run the tape through a pair of reel-to-reel recorders—one set to record and the other to play, with the second machine feeding back into the first. The results were revelatory. Years later, speaking to jazz guitarist Henry Kaiser, Riley described the effect as a hypnotic synthesis of intention and surprise. “It has a geometric order and a periodicity, but it becomes this gently moving landscape, so things come into it and fade out of it…You get this caravan of ideas that go on and on, and constantly change.” Riley came up with an appropriately science-fiction-sounding name for it: the time-lag accumulator.In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Riley applied his time-lag accumulator in different contexts. On electric organ, he experimented with long delays of several seconds or more that allowed him to create intricate counterpoints, as though he were duetting with himself; he also explored millisecond-long slap-back delays, which created an illusion of space—as though he were performing on the rim of a canyon, each note bouncing back from the far side. On his early classic A Rainbow in Curved Air, recorded in 1968 and released in 1969, he used eight-track recording to create densely filigreed polyphonic fugues, but he also applied the technique in live performance. Newly reissued, Descending Moonshine Dervishes is a landmark in his catalog of keyboard works. The album is an early iteration of a style that would become known by various names—kosmische, new age, ambient, trance—yet was, for the moment, unknown territory, a groundbreaking blend of Indian raga, minimalist drone, and technological wizardry. In the music’s crystalline churn, conventional timekeeping melts away, as fluid as one of Salvador Dalí’s clocks.",Experimental,8.1
77,"Hot off the flirty summer hit “Nasty,” the singer-songwriter delivers a lean and muscular collection of songs for the club and the road. To put it in terms quantum physicist Erwin Schrödinger might understand, Tinashe has both finally arrived and has always been here. Over the last few albums, the singer-songwriter has transformed herself into an autodidact of production, mixing, and general perseverance outside of the major label system. Tinashe hasn’t courted a mainstream audience in years, instead cultivating a broad artistic vision and an IYKYK ethos that made her an outlier in an industry obsessed with conformity. Rocket-launched by the summer takeover of “Nasty,” a lip-biting, hip gyrating, flirty-wink of a song that activated nerves at both ends of the spine—everyone’s a freak for something, be it sex toys or anti-colonialist literature—her elastic seventh album is a cool-girl marker for those drawn to the California bombshell’s malleable, kinetic sound.Quantum Baby is a lean and muscular eight-song accompaniment to 2023’s BB/Ang3l that asserts itself with the insistence of manicured nails tapping on a hard surface: There are things to do and people to flip off. Opener “No Simulation” is a slinky almost-ballad that quickly announces itself as Brandy-inspired, courtesy of Tinashe’s dynamic vocal stacking. “These days I wanna feel it, no simulation/It’s gotta be true,” she croons. It sounds like she’s looking for real love—but then again, Tinashe is a comedic and peculiar storyteller (her one-liners in Two and a Half Men always landed), and when she pledges “to go deeper,” she might be giving more explicit directions.“Getting No Sleep” is a windows-down, stereo-blasting song. Tinashe has confessed to working on her music while behind the wheel and it’s easy to envision her driving around LA with this sweetly erotic hit on repeat, getting a feel for how it accelerates and fades away. It’s for the club and the road, aided by a persistent bassline and skillfully placed rhythmic loops that deftly slide into the killer “Thirsty.” Even as her vocals are surrounded by hi-hats and synths, dripping in innuendo, they sound stripped and naked. She’s assured and capable, hovering in a fluttering register: “Don’t play, don’t hurt me/Tryna make you so thirsty/I know that you want me in the worst way/Do it like it’s my birthday.”It helps that Tinashe makes being thirsty look cool, never desperate. Everyone is hooking up, and the singer wants the fiending to be confident and clear, the cosmic opposite of a low-effort “hey” in the DMs. She continues the pleasure quest on “When I Get You Alone,” making noticeable callbacks to Janet Jackson’s “I Get Lonely”: Both songs are committed to the beat drop and the patience love requires. “No Broke Boys” and “Red Flags” touch on intimate disappointments, calibrated to proliferate shady IG captions. The sparse writing sometimes lags as it revisits well-trodden topics—it’s not deep enough to jolt any festering memories. It’s just the tip of what could really be experienced. (A Flo Milli feature could have injected some needed whimsy.)After branching out as an independent artist three albums ago, Tinashe has less and less to prove. Easy as it is to understand the appeal of “Nasty” (it’s “catchy” and “memeable,” Tinashe opined), there’s two reasons that it’s become her first solo Billboard hit and highest charting single since “2 On,” 2014’s turn-up anthem with Schoolboy Q. The first is the very ’20s fortune of hitting the TikTok lottery, which brought her to a bigger audience without having to spend a dime. The second is that “Nasty” just happens to be the platonically great Tinashe song: Easy and exquisite, an evolution without a departure.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

78,"The third record from the Nigerian pop star has the muted thrills of a victory lap: a triumphant showcase that covers well-trodden ground. Asake’s Lungu Boy takes its title from a word meaning “ghetto” or “hood,” but on his third album, the Nigerian artist is at pains to show his worldliness. “I don’t want to be just a guy from Africa, but a guy who came to this world and made a difference in music,” he told Apple Music. It’s a new phase in a rapid ascent. On his 2022 debut, Mr. Money With the Vibe, the artist born Ahmed Ololade synthesized diverse strains of Nigerian pop, then showcased his rise to fame on last year’s Work of Art. Lungu Boy is an ode to the Lagos singer’s humble beginnings, reflecting on his journey and exploring the duality of struggle and success. But by sticking so rigidly to the rags-to-riches script—and his now-familiar balancing act between gratitude and braggadocio—the album acquires a feeling of deja vu. Lungu Boy feels like a victory lap: triumphant but covering well-trodden ground.On Lungu Boy, Asake triples down on his signature palette of Afropiano, hip-hop, and neo-fújì, a style that blends elements of Indigenous Yoruba music (choral harmonies, polyrhythmic drumming, Islamic references) with Afrobeats rhythms and street storytelling. His mid-tempo flow is familiar by now, but he scales back the South African amapiano elements to make room for other sounds. On “Uhh Yeahh,” Dutch DJ Dave Nunes’ production brings a nimble techno touch to the quick-stepping rhythm. On the calypso-inflected “Mood,” over classical guitar licks and the fluttery harmonies of French-Gabonese singer Anaïs Cardot, he reflects on his fluctuating emotions in Spanish. But though it ought to be a natural addition to Asake’s polyglot style, the Spanish verse doesn’t have anything new to say—it’s a direct translation of the earlier English lyrics.There are more features this time around, with mixed results. Stormzy’s presence on the grime-accented “Suru” is a good fit, pushing Asake into more introspective territory as he opens up about his late mother. Other collabs, like the Central Cee-assisted “Wave” and Travis Scott-backed “Active,” aim for peak hype but end up feeling overcrowded. Asake’s charisma and the turbo-charged production are enough for sticky dancefloors, but I can’t help but wonder what might have been had Asake focused less on hitting the geographical coordinates of crossover success. With a nomination for International Artist of the Year at this year’s BRITs alongside titans like Taylor Swift, Burna Boy, and winner SZA, he’s already solidified his global standing. It would’ve been more exciting to see him team up with emerging talent from the African and Black diaspora who could offer more dynamism than the mainstream roster.",Pop,6.6
79,"Following a move from New Delhi to a scenic village in North Goa, the Indian indie rockers explore sunnier, more bucolic shades in their trademark fusion of sounds, eras, and cultural traditions. Over the past 14 years, Indian indie-rock veterans Peter Cat Recording Co. have perfected their own particular style of fusion. They travel across time and geography, plundering sounds and aesthetics—early-20th-century cabaret, 1950s vocal jazz, 1960s soul, 1970s Bollywood, and early-2000s indie rock—and assembling these transcultural artifacts into improbable collages, warping their references’ familiarity into something more subversive, and occasionally a little sinister.They follow that blueprint to excellent effect on “People Never Change,” the lead single off their latest album, BETA. The dholak and iktara that kick things off suggest the sort of earthy Punjabi folk pop that is inescapable at North Indian weddings, then feint left by adding sub-aquatic bass synth and jazz saxophone. The song constantly mutates, weaving a dizzying, six-and-a-half-minute path through funk, disco, bossa nova, and psychedelia. But though they borrow heavily from previous eras, PCRC are driven by the urge to move forward, rousing the ghosts of the past to interrogate the fault lines of the present, both personal and political.Such creative restlessness has always been central to the PCRC ethos, especially in the years they spent gestating in the Indian rock underground. Their catalog is full of abrupt left turns: from cinematic cabaret-punk to surrealistic soundscapes of noise and found sound, from psychedelic slow waltzes to mutant amalgamations of guitar drone and James Chance-esque trumpet. The only constants have been a seemingly limitless capacity for surprising their fans and frontman Suryakant Sawhney’s seductive 1950s croon, marinated in subtle, self-aware melancholy.BETA—which means “son” in Hindi, a reference to drummer Karan Singh recently becoming a father—builds on the dizzying stylistic shifts and artful studio trickery of their 2019 breakthrough Bismallah, smashing disparate sounds, eras, and cultural traditions together to create entirely new sound worlds, each composition an exercise in alternate history and speculative fiction. The chromatic synths and distorted bass pulses of “21c” conjure up a ballroom from the 2050s, marrying old-world grace with space-age synths. “Black and White” opens with an MBV-esque wall of guitar noise that gives way to a propulsive funk groove and blown-out bass synths as the song mutates from shoegaze freakout to the bastard love child of bossa nova, disco, and rave.Elsewhere, PCRC move their sound further into the sunlight, dabbling in subtropical psychedelia and the bucolic wistfulness of early-2000s indie folk. On opener “Flowers R. Blooming,” ghungroo, swarsangam, clarinet, and acoustic guitar coalesce into a shimmering wash of sound, invoking the pastoral beauty of the North Indian heartland. “I Deny Me”—a rousing ballad about the redemptive power of music, written and sung by bassist Dhruv Bhola—sounds like it would fit seamlessly into the Garden State soundtrack, all soulful warble and earnest finger-plucked guitar.",Rock,7.4
80,"The Detroit rapper teams up with Oakland’s Squadda B for some interstate madness. J.U.S rolls with every beat for a record that sounds specifically local but refreshingly timeless. Detroit and the Bay Area are two rap meccas that are forever intertwined. Some theorize the bond goes back to the early days of the Great Migration when a few automobile plants moved from Detroit to Oakland; others claim the ties were built through generations of hustling. Payroll Giovanni, a modern-day icon of Detroit rap, considered the synchronicity to have fully bloomed in hip-hop when influential local crew the Street Lord’z were collaborating with Bay Area stars like E-40, Spice 1, and Too $hort in the late ’90s and early 2000s. For his part, Too $hort said, “Detroit, it’s like Oakland/It’s a Black thing and I’m a Black man.” (Hey, sometimes it’s really that simple.) If Too $hort’s Detroit shoutout was the proposal, then the Street Lord’z’s 1999 cross-pollinated debut mixtape was the wedding day.That’s all to explain why Detroit’s J.U.S and Oakland’s Squadda B sound as if they share the same brain right out the gate on their first joint album, 3rd Shift. On the mic is J.U.S, a longtime engineer and producer with Bruiser Brigade, the Danny Brown–led crew of elder-millennial shit-talkers. In the last few years, he’s turned his attention to slick-tongued, autobiographical rhymes. Behind the boards is Squadda, formerly one-half of rap duo Main Attrakionz, who dropped one of the great mixtapes of the early 2010s with 808s & Dark Grapes II.Together, on 3rd Shift, they’re a loose-lipped, hi-hat-happy riot. J.U.S’ storytelling is personal and funny as hell: a lifetime of balancing Detroit player status and more ordinary responsibilities has him worn down. “I’m on the road doin’ shows I don’t miss my bitch/She be hatin’, say I’m old, I should fuckin’ quit,” he raps on “Da Best Out,” sounding as weathered as Lethal Weapon’s Roger Murtaugh. Squadda underlines the mood with a stringy beat that could appear in a spaghetti western, a genre full of aging gunslingers clinging to their dreams. Squadda’s instrumentals are miraculously suffocating and untrendy: He sounds like he’s been disconnected from the internet for half a decade, which makes the beats feel fresh and unpredictable.No surprise with Bruiser Brigade: The clique has created a world rooted in regional scenes—Detroit, specifically—while working at their own unconcerned pace. J.U.S pulls that off on 3rd Shift, leaning into the hallmarks of his rapping-ass city: Sticky one-liners and imagery that is so outlandish that it has to be rooted in some sort of truth. I could imagine his Cash Money bars on “Nascar” fitting in with the luxurious flexes of Peezy and Babyface Ray; I could hear his smoothly rapped verse on “We Outside”—with mentions of his chicken wing order and gator shoes—on a posse cut with the sharp-witted punchline kings of Flint. The shift is from Detroit hustler talking like a small-time kingpin to Detroit hustler sounding stressed out in the need of a vacation, raps where you can tell he has lived a hundred lives and has multiple stories to tell about each one. On “Cheese Cheese Cheese,” his experience casts a gloomier mood as his struggles and insecurities pile up. On “6K” he approaches the never-ending grind with a relentless sense of humor: “I got mortgage, I got habits, I got freaks I owe a few.” Everyday headaches are still the greatest source of hip-hop comedy.",Rap,8.2
81,"The Boston group translates its habitually dreamlike reveries into sharply focused songwriting, bringing newfound heaviness to its narcotic haze. When Dimitri Giannopoulos was a teenager, he thought he might be living in a dream. Alienated, anxious, and unsettled, he tried his hardest to process a world that he felt disconnected from. “I refused to believe anything I was seeing was happening to me or even happening at all,” he told Allston Pudding in 2016. “I was just freaked out by everything.” He says that he’s since outgrown his existential angst, but similar feelings have clearly found a home in the slow-moving gloom of the songs he makes in Horse Jumper of Love.The forms of those songs have shifted occasionally over the years—from hushed, stripped-down recordings that recall Phil Elverum’s sky-gazing folk songs to distressed lo-fi experiments in the mold of Bedhead’s desperate slowcore to Siamese Dream—but they’re all united by Giannopoulos’ oblique approach to songwriting. His lyrics are vivid but fragmented and opaque; he frequently sounds like someone describing a dream as their eyes slowly open.On the band’s new album Disaster Trick, Giannopoulos often does just that. He recalls or references dreams in four separate songs, and throughout the record, his writing is similarly disorienting and enigmatic. On opener “Snow Angel,” he sings of funerals and drownings, of looming evil and a desire to be alone. Elsewhere he meditates on emptiness, witnesses bloodbaths, and remembers, through a haze, an argument that went too far. It’s hard to piece together concrete narratives, but his cryptic koans and foggy memories have a strangely affecting power.For all the uncertainty and malaise reflected in the lyrics, Disaster Trick is full of some of the band’s most focused and direct arrangements. The component parts of each track are the same: languorous guitar lines from Giannopoulos and weighty contributions from the rhythm section of drummer James Doran and bassist John Margaris. But the band has more focus and purpose this time around. Giannopoulos says it’s the first time they’ve ever actually approached the recording process with a clear head, rather than “just show up at a studio, drink, and record,” and it shows—murky as the lyrics may be, the playing is grounded and crushing.The snowblind shoegaze dirge of “Snow Angel” taps into a new kind of heaviness for the band. And even when they operate in more familiar, slowcore-inspired modes, as on the leaden “Wait by the Stairs,” they bring compelling new elements to their sound. That song’s sludgy arpeggios and trudging rhythms are ballasted by airy harmonies from Wednesday’s Karly Hartzman; the deliberate ornamentation feels like a genuine innovation for a band that’s often favored more spartan arrangements.With Disaster Trick, Horse Jumper of Love subtly expand their sound without losing the instinctual, otherworldly interplay of their melodies, dizzying guitar lines and serpentine rhythms blurring together in a narcotic ooze. It’s a fitting accompaniment, as ever, for Giannopoulos’ somnambulant murmurs. Carried by his detached delivery, the songs mirror the feeling of spacing out on the couch after a particularly rough day, the grim details of what you went through floating numbly in the periphery of your awareness, always just out of reach.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

82,"The Indianapolis band is a standout voice in the new generation of shoegaze. Its debut album is filled with memorable hooks and blistering guitars that draw on Midwest emo and 2000s pop. You may have heard that shoegaze is having a moment, and that its embrace by a new generation of moody teens has pushed the genre beyond further reverb-drenched horizons. Wishy, a five-piece act hailing from Indianapolis, put their own spin on the trend: Last year’s Paradise EP featured callbacks to the band’s Midwest emo roots while paying homage to Pale Saints and Jimmy Eat World in equal measure. Their full-length debut Triple Seven builds upon that wistful sound—you might call it emo-gaze, or gaze-pop—and matches it to the lethargic possibilities of a suburban summer’s dog days.The album opens with the one-two punch of “Sick Sweet” and “Triple Seven”—both songs about having a crush, written by Wishy’s lead singer-songwriters/guitarists Kevin Krauter and Nina Pitchkites, respectively. With Krauter, the feeling is all hyperbole and desperation. “So starved for the sunshine/Won’t you be mine, be mine, be mine,” he pleads over a barrage of guitars and drums. Pitchkites takes the dreamier route; singing over a backbeat reminiscent of Blue Bell Knoll-era Cocteau Twins, she imagines being carefree enough to fall head over heels with no regrets. Really, they’re two sides of the same coin: The lyrical differences add depth and variety to the band’s style, but at their core, Krauter and Pitchkites are tackling the same universal feelings—infatuation, restlessness, small-town ennui—that have concerned alt-rock bands since the genre’s inception.Despite the occasionally twee subject matter, Wishy also dabble in face-melting pedal effects, especially in the MBV drones on “Game” and Turnstile-like controlled chaos of “Spit.” Drummer Conner Host, who replaced the band’s programmed machines last year, adds a frenzied wall of sound to the mix, pushing the band towards a more hardcore identity. But mostly, Wishy excels at really good pop songs. “Love on the Outside” is the kind of rock-out summer anthem you’d expect to hear on the car stereo 20 years ago, with Krauter belting that earworm of a chorus like he’s been training his whole life for it. Meanwhile, Pitchkites slows everything down for the blissed-out “Just Like Sunday,” describing a getaway fantasy as though she has all the time in the world. The drum machines come back for this one alongside luxuriating synth lines, conjuring up an idyllic version of 2000s pop.The way Wishy combines their grab-bag of influences isn’t always so seamless. On “Busted,” Krauter decides to channel Julian Casablancas, his distorted, disaffected vocals clashing with the song’s buoyant guitar line. It’s catchy, like the rest of Triple Seven, but stalls out by the middle. Still, Wishy’s most cohesive moments come from their knack for memorable, solid melodies. “Persuasion,” with its cheerful, jangling guitars and simple hook—one of the few moments on the album where Krauter and Pitchkites harmonize—would fit easily into a college freshman’s homemade mixtape, or the soundtrack to an aughts teen rom-com.Wishy lean heavily on these nostalgic evocations but aren’t welded to them. Contrary to the literal implications of the shoegaze label, you get the sense that Krauter and Pitchkites are looking ever-outward for their inspiration. Lyrics may not matter as much as vibes on “Little While”—where Pitchkites is doing her best Bilinda Butcher, letting her high register blend into the overall texture of the song—but within that sprawling landscape, she drops a particularly 2020s reference: “Self-driving car/I wonder where you are/You warned me, ‘Don’t get in.’” The mix of old-school dream-pop and hyper-modern metaphor works; you can picture her, in the wake of a breakup, learning to navigate the world without a safety net. It’s those small surprises all over Triple Seven that show Wishy breathing new life into an old formula.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

83,"The sequel to the rappers’ collab album from February is even shoddier in construction and execution than its predecessor. VULTURES 2 opens with a staggering wall of sound that resembles THX’s Deep Note. Dr. Dre’s 2001 famously opens with the same sonic logo, using it to establish the cinematic scope of the album’s slick, muscular G-funk. “Everything you hear is planned. It’s a movie,” Dre told The New York Times in 1999. With its exquisitely arranged melodies and drums, 2001 was immersive and detailed, like cruising through Southern California in the Discovery One. Listening to VULTURES 2, the sequel to Ye and Ty Dolla $ign’s surprisingly coherent collab from February, is more akin to being imprisoned inside an Akademiks livestream. There is little noteworthy or thrilling happening in this strange, inert environment, despite the constant provocations and snippets of intrigue.This isn’t surprising. Ye, who once said he got his “entire sound” from “Xxplosive,” hasn’t really focused on music for the past eight years. Though his army of collaborators occasionally uses his extensive resources to stitch together a distinct beat or galvanize say, Playboi Carti or Jay Electronica, to black out, Ye mostly uses songs to soundtrack his live events, be they fashion shows or listening sessions at stadiums. From the Madison Square Garden release party for The Life of Pablo to his Sunday Service series to the Donda shows, he’s increasingly oriented his work toward eyes rather than ears, a mode that favors diehard believers over discerning listeners. At this point, Ye is more of a ceremonial figurehead than a conductor.VULTURES 2 acknowledges this diminished role, making it a sequel in the most modern Hollywood of ways. Were you partial to that swaggering Carti verse on “Carnival?” He’s back for “Field Trip.” Speaking of “Carnival,” those lurching stadium chants were pretty neat, yeah? “Fried” has you covered. Were you fond of the “Whip My Hair”-core kids bop of North West on “Talking?” She returns on “Bomb,” repeating Japanese greetings ad nauseam alongside her sister Chicago West. Do you miss the “old Kanye?” Peep the “Good Life” reference on “Promotion.” These two aren’t using songs to express themselves or explore sounds and themes; they’re more keen to prove they’re impervious to shame. “They tried to hit me with the cyanide/Nice try,” Ye taunts on “Slide.”In its best moments, VULTURES 1 treated Ye like a lame duck. Although Ye’s rapping on VULTURES 1 was notably smoother compared to the poopy-di-scoop of his post-Pablo output, the songs seemed to consciously work around Ye’s deflated performances and edgelord antics, often keeping him—Cash Money-style—away from a given track’s first and last verses. Considering that, a generous reading is that VULTURES 1 was a Ty Dolla album with a Ye-sized budget. But in practice, the Hitler-loving provocateur remained in the middle, ringmaster to the cursed circus.",Rap,4.6
84,"On the Clayton County rapper’s third album, her winking Southern charm gets lost in an abundance of anonymous beats. Is Sugar Honey Iced Tea a thinly veiled backronym directed at a fellow female rapper? Not according to Latto: “This is something that just felt Southern to me,” she demurred last month. Mirroring this brand-friendly regionalism, Sugar is built around aggressively adequate Atlanta trap anthems and functionally anonymous readymades that only occasionally reflect the full force of Latto’s talent. These songs do not demand to be played—they ask not to be skipped.This is particularly frustrating given the strength of Latto’s singles over the past year. While her biggest hits to date are the wedding-ready pop confection “Big Energy” and last summer’s Jung Kook collaboration “Seven,” Latto has simultaneously been cutting some of her toughest tracks ever, popping out with newcomer Anycia on “Back Outside” and threatening to pull up with “20 black Suburbans” full of goons on “Sunday Service.” Latto has said Sugar Honey Iced Tea was inspired by her 2023 song “Put It on Da Floor,” which “sparked a whole new energy for me as an artist.” Yet both “Put It on Da Floor” and “Sunday Service” are relegated to bonus track status (alongside their star-studded remixes). That energy is sorely missed: When Sugar Honey Iced Tea tries to come across brusque and threatening on would-be Playboi Carti song “Blick Sum,” it feels silly rather than savage.Silly isn’t a terrible look for Latto, whose simple rhymes are often delivered with an exaggerated wink. Take “Brokey,” where she says she’s sick of Givenchy Shark Lock boots (“Y’all burnt ’em out”), or the Young Nudy-assisted standout “Shrimp & Grits,” which kicks off, “Squirting on a nigga, he drinking my piss/Freak bitch, make him swallow my spit.” She rarely drops proper nouns, zoomed in on cash, carats, and an amorphous array of men eager to please. And although she’s quick to tease a hater that their boyfriend could be hers, Latto’s raps stay playful enough that even when she tosses off a line like “Body count so low, I might say I’m a virgin,” it scans as sardonic rather than slut-shaming.But long stretches of Sugar Honey Iced Tea are devoid of Latto’s peculiar charms. Tracks with Coco Jones and Teezo Touchdown could blend into any major label rap release; album outro “S/O to Me” aspires to be corny like Drake and sort of succeeds. Uglier still is a raft of populist tracks aimed at Top 40 and Rap Caviar. The former include Ciara feature “Good 2 You,” which exists, and a Megan Thee Stallion collaboration that manages to sound like a K-pop B-side without involving a single pop artist; the latter include the ponderous “Settle Down” and lackluster cuts like “Liquor” and “H&M,” where Latto’s impassioned vocals can’t fully zhuzh up run-of-the-mill beats. These lowest-common-denominator plays are a slog on an already too-long album.",Rap,6.1
85,"Six months before his death, the composer sat down to record Opus, his final concert film and album. Slow and contemplative, it offers a moving testament to his spirit and perseverance. When director Neo Sora was approached by his father, Ryuichi Sakamoto, to direct the concert film that became Ryuichi Sakamoto | Opus, urgency was in the air. Sakamoto and his team knew that the week-long sessions planned for September 2022 might be the last time the 70-year-old composer, whose cancer had recently escalated to stage four, might have the energy to record. But the urgency was not motivated only by a sense of dwindling time. Even though he was so physically weakened that he could perform only a few songs at a time, Sakamoto felt full of ideas and creative energy.Sakamoto drew up new arrangements of some of the most notable songs from his career, prepared three new pieces, and contemplated ways to stage them; he imagined the studio lighting shifting with the daylight over the course of the performances, progressing from early-morning gloom to afternoon sunshine and back to stark twilight. This cyclical motion provides a somber echo of the subtext of the film: All things must end. Opus—the soundtrack to the film—could easily have been a maudlin document of Sakamoto’s final concert, but instead, it feels like a celebration of the irrepressible perseverance of one of popular music’s most steadfast experimenters.OpusSakamoto spoke occasionally of harboring a perfectionist’s drive. In 2016, after decades of era-defining music across genres and media, he said that he still hoped to one day make a “masterpiece” before he died. He seemed to think of his live performances the same way. “I try to be as close to perfection as possible,” he told The Fader in 2017. One of the most striking things about Opus is the suggestion that he has finally abandoned his perfectionist tendencies. His playing throughout is emotionally resonant and carefully considered, but he eschews showy displays of technical prowess in favor of an intimate depiction of the man behind the piano. The film offers a careful study of Sakamoto’s facial expressions, an occasional grimace cracking his intense focus. In a halting performance of “Bibo no Aozora,” he pauses and restarts the song, searching for the right chords. (That moment from the film doesn’t make it onto the album, where his playing begins tentatively and swiftly grows softly confident.)One of the record’s most affecting moments is its rendition of Yellow Magic Orchestra’s “Tong Poo,” presented in a new arrangement at a slower tempo than usual. In its original 1978 incarnation, the song is a taut collage of splatter-painted synth melodies. But on Opus, it’s deeply human, rendering familiar melodies as an elegiac meditation on the time that’s passed since he first recorded it. Two of the new pieces offer similarly thoughtful looks back, paying tribute to lost friends and collaborators: “BB” honors the director Bernardo Bertolucci and “for Jóhann” is dedicated to the composer Jóhann Jóhannsson. In each, Sakamoto conjures powerful feelings from sparse chords. They’re intense documents of grief and love, made all the more moving knowing that their first recording would also very likely be their last performance.The most stirring moments take place in the margins, like on “Andata”—originally recorded for Sakamoto’s 2017 album async—when the sounds of his breathing whisper over the top of the serpentine piano melodies. Elsewhere, amid the hush, you can hear the movement of the piano’s pedals and his subtly shifting position on the bench. The presence of these sounds makes the recording feel deeply embodied—they offer a sense of kinetic energy being wrung out of him at a time when such expenditure was costly to him. Sakamoto wrote that the month after the filming of Opus, his physical condition worsened and he felt “utterly hollow. Still, in between the chords, he breathes, and for one last time, the melodies spill out of him just as naturally.",Experimental,7.6
86,"The rapper continues to mine heavy existential themes against a newly vaporous, kaleidoscopic palette. It’s among his darkest work, but also his most piercing and inventive. Sometimes, a glimpse of your reflection in a mirror can feel as disorienting as a dolly zoom, a jarring flash of presence that pulls you into a dark corner of yourself. Mavi experiences several such moments of revelation on Shadowbox, his howling, heart-rending third album. Each glance sends him spinning off his axis, frantically flailing until he can snag a piece of ground. “I’m So Tired” opens with one of these realizations: “Today my grandmother turn 80/And I’m on three Percocets, I ain’t even ate yet.” Mavi holds his own gaze as though it’s Persephone beckoning seductively from the bottom of the abyss. Synth bass and splashy cymbals cascade around him like a collapsing ceiling, reverb threatening to engulf his pleas for absolution.Mavi’s music can almost feel voyeuristic, as though we’re watching his brain activity from behind a two-way mirror. The Charlotte emcee churns in existential circles, pondering towering concepts like the conflict between fate and free will, or whether identity is innate or constructed. This is painful work; he was only 21 when he released End of the Earth, and he’d already concluded that existence is suffering—you either wallow or you press on. Despite its glowing golden-hour grooves, 2022’s Laughing So Hard, it Hurts was awash in self-doubt, Mavi’s joints aching from trying to keep balance.On Shadowbox, the darkness that licked at the edges of his previous work has nearly overtaken him. As Laughing So Hard, it Hurts propelled him to a new level of stardom, Mavi experienced a spell of personal problems; the substances he hoped would ease his mind dulled his creative drive and aggravated his depression. When he emerged, he started writing unflinchingly about how exhausting it is to untangle a mental health crisis. References to drugs and drink abound; grief and heartache permeate every verse. He remains concerned with many of the same evergreen philosophical questions, but he’s less sure there are any answers to be found.Thankfully, Shadowbox never buckles under the weight of its overcast themes. It’s as inventive as any Mavi project, near virtuosic in execution. Despite the narcotic cloud surrounding the album’s creation, Mavi’s writing is more impressive than ever: rich with imagery and metaphor and packed with spiraling internal rhymes, but still piercing and direct. The most unsparing passages hit like a fist, like when he says, “I was taking pills while mom was making dinner” on “Tether,” or how he admits, on “Grindstone,” “I claim I’m quitting, it’s been too many tomorrows.” A water motif shows up throughout the first half of the record, sometimes offering salvation through baptism or cleansing, other times promising to envelop Mavi completely.",Rap,8.0
87,"John Dwyer’s ever-inventive psych-garage band plugs synth demos into samplers and thrashes and pulses without the aid of a single guitar. Just add saxophone. If you zoned out of John Dwyer’s mutant garage-scuzz outfit somewhere around the time they evolved from Thee Oh Sees into Osees, you might take SORCS 80 for the work of a different band. All sampled squalor and lo-tech distortion, SORCS 80 thrashes and pulses without the aid of a single guitar, the product of Dwyer’s decision to abandon six strings for electronics. Dwyer specializes in these kinds of abrupt turns: He sheds styles faster than he changes band names, splicing prog and punk without considering whether his monster can survive. As combative as it gets, SORCS 80 represents a settling of sorts for Osees—a place where the lacerating punk of A Foul Form and the pugnacious synth-pop of Intercepted Message intertwine.Taking inspiration from the nervy post-punk pulse of Intercepted Message, Dwyer decided to create SORCS 80 using samplers, approaching the electronics with the finesse of a caveman. Alongside Osees keyboardist Tom Dolas, he hotwired four-track demos through Roland SPD-SX sampling pads, which the pair then triggered with drumsticks. Neither musician plays their signature instrument: Their work comes through the samplers in shards glued together by bassist Tim Hellman and decorated by saxophonists CansFis Foote and Brad Caulkins.Those saxophones are intended to recall the shambolic soul of Dexys Midnight Runners, another chief inspiration for Dwyer here. If you squint, it’s possible to discern echoes of Searching for the Young Soul Rebels on “Earthling,” where he’s buoyed by nagging horns as he bellows from his gut like Kevin Rowland. Soul isn’t the only style the saxophones stir up: On “Drug City,” the sax conjures the ghost of James Chance, landing squarely between no wave and new wave. What’s fascinating about SORCS 80 is that it feels vaguely rootless—some sounds are familiar but the form is not.That isn’t to say Dwyer has chucked out hooks or melodies the way he did his guitar. SORCS 80 contains some of his sharpest recent songwriting—the tunes just happen to get transformed by the Osees’ execution. “Termination Officer” shoves its glammed-up chorus through a digital shredder; “Cochon d’Argent” floods with synth burbles and hyperactive beats. Sometimes, the dense electronic fog lifts: “Lear’s Ears” has enough air in its rhythms to suggest funk, a trick replicated on “Also the Gorilla…,” which pairs the album’s nimblest groove with one of its catchiest tunes.Hooks or even individual songs are hardly the point, though. SORCS 80 is an immersive listen. Hearing the Osees wrestle with their equipment, forcing the instruments—and themselves—to behave in ways they are not accustomed is a visceral experience. Bashing away at samplers as if they’re drums, the band sounds like it’s breaking out of the cave and into the modern world.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

88,"Bea Kristi’s third album, co-produced by Rick Rubin, deploys a more subdued, acoustic palette to render an accurate portrait of early adulthood. Shuffling through Beabadoobee’s discography is like taking a waterslide tour of ’00s radio. Beatrice Kristi’s 2020 debut Fake It Flowers showcased windy, Alanis Morissette abandon, while 2022’s Beatopia twirled deeper into Hilary Duff territory with its Disneyland sparkle and talk of Tinkerbell. Kristi’s newly released third album, This Is How Tomorrow Moves, continues the trend in prime Suzanne Vega coffee shop style. This album—the first Beabadoobee album to be co-produced by pop music mystic Rick Rubin—is a more subdued, acoustic version of her eager sleepover soundtracks. That’s to its credit: This Is How Tomorrow Moves’ folk-pop experiments tend to be more impressive than its sweetness.Call it growing up. While Beatopia conceptualized a fantasy world that Kristi created as a child, Kristi said in press materials that This Is How Tomorrow Moves is about womanhood, “I guess.” A lot has changed since she first started releasing music in 2017, at age 17. Now, at 24, she’s tried shrooms and gone on tour with Taylor Swift; most people will only ever accomplish half as much. So, with her third eye widened and career thriving, Kristi uses This Is How Tomorrow Moves to demonstrate that one compelling thing you can do with excess is eliminate it.The album’s minimalist moments are its strongest. “California” and “Post” introduce clanging drum loops, recalling the sparse, twisted roots of a Tori Amos song like “Space Dog.” “Everything I Want,” a whispery lullaby about a crush, has a sly, Lisa Loeb lilt to its restrained guitar, distilling an all-purpose romance into something more potent. These quiet seconds of introspection add hand-puppet drama to This Is How Tomorrow Moves: darkness and a little friction. Kristi sounds like she’s moved past the soft suction-cup kissing of a Rachael Leigh Cook movie and unwrapped the gift of hindsight.But This Is How Tomorrow Moves sometimes douses its introspection in unnecessary syrup. Kristi and her Beatopia collaborator (here, Rubin’s co-producer) Jacob Bugden have defanged bad feelings this way on past albums. Worried about your waistline, like Kristi sings on “Girl Song”? Beabadoobee pairs this anxiety with an overly sentimental piano. Noticing a tendency to infantilize yourself, as Kristi does on “Tie My Shoes”? Well, why not add a few cheerful horns. These flower-in-your-hair flourishes are reminiscent of the tail-wagging love songs that first made Beabadoobee famous on YouTube years ago, but amid the confident calm of the rest of This Is How Tomorrow Moves, they feel regressive, as safe as a pacifier.",Pop,7.4
89,"Jade Lilitri’s latest is an economical, punchy rock record about love and death that still expands the band’s core sound. Oso Oso albums have promised elaborate narratives about chimeric monsters, a travelog of romantic intrigue in a fictional town, great big beaches, and great big blunts. But on Life Till Bones, Jade Lilitri is no longer fleeing from his own reality. “Other people’s stories got me feeling bored,” he sings at the close of his fifth LP. If there was a change in sound to match the change in sentiment, Life Till Bones might be industrial noise or pluggnb instead of the toothsome emo pop that Oso Oso has been perfecting for the better part of a decade. Still, the commitment to a, gasp, darker, more introspective Oso Oso album in mood alone is enough to make Life Till Bones feel like a welcome expansion of the band’s core aesthetic rather than a mere embellishment.Long-time Oso Oso producer Billy Mannino recently proclaimed the VVS brilliance of Jimmy Eat World’s 2004 record Futures as the standard for “big punchy rock records.” Lest anyone think he was tipping his hand, Life Till Bones is a small, punchy rock record, a string of pearly, polished gems. It’s as if Mannino and Lilitri gave themselves a “clarity, not Clarity” mandate to do away with just about everything that doesn’t provide an immediate payoff: overdubs, reverb, synth washes, or anything as blasé as “a second verse” or “bridge.” A single digital handclap during the chorus of “All of My Love” is about as indulgent as things get here. But having the chorus take up over half the song? That’s economical writing.If Life Till Bones lacks something as explosive as “The View” or “Reindeer Games” or “Computer Exploder” within its 29 minutes, Lilitri makes up for it by reinventing himself as a master of efficiency. The experimentation here takes place on a micro level, song structures inverted and streamlined for maximum impact, genre interludes reduced to teasers. The brisk basslines of “The Country Club” and “Skippy” alone reveal Lilitri’s mindset for a “dancier” Oso Oso album, one that means a slight repositioning along the spectrum between The O.C. and Meet Me in the Bathroom, where the jeans are tight and the rhythm section’s even tighter. “That’s What Time Does” pushes that timeline forward, imagining a teenaged Lilitri trying to find middle ground between the Paramore and Phoenix singles on his iPod Nano; the first nü-yacht rock Oso Oso single ends up smooth enough for Rob Thomas’ approval.",Rock,7.5
90,"The Toronto hardcore band’s latest builds on their previous records not by going bigger but by honing the small stuff: intricate melodies, squelching guitar loops, and Damian Abraham’s ornately aggressive performance. Fucked Up makes music under the sign of more. Within its prolific output, the Toronto band has made hardcore both denser—piling on tightly orchestrated guitar overdubs—and more distended, stretching out their ideas over baroque, hour-plus albums and a sprawling EP series based on the Chinese zodiac. In recent years, though, the band has been experimenting with less. In 2023, they challenged themselves to make an album—aptly titled One Day—where each member wrote and recorded their parts in just 24 hours. (In August 2024 they took this concept further, livestreaming a daylong album sprint and making the final product available on Bandcamp for another 24 hours. The impulse toward more dies hard.) The result was a tightly focused blast from a band whose releases can tend toward the baggy.As its title suggests, Another Day continues to mine many of One Day’s thematic concerns: making peace with human finitude, taking stock of a damaged world. But instead of short bursts of energy, Fucked Up’s latest release feels like the product of careful sculpting and molding, with a focus on the connective tissue between songs. More than half of the tracks open with a crush of droning fuzz guitars, each shrunk down to occupy a tiny notch of frequencies. It is a new trick for Fucked Up, but it is a logical extension of the role the guitar has long served in the band: not a blunt instrument of aggression, but a diffuser of texture and melody. Here, when the full band kicks in, they aren’t shattering the mirror-pond calm of these guitar soundscapes but skimming on top of them, building on their energy.Part of the excitement of listening to Fucked Up is in hearing how melody emerges from the interplay of layered parts, including Damian Abraham’s orc-bellow vocals, and Another Day features some of the finest and most intricate melodies in the band’s catalog. After the synth-guitar haze dissipates, “Tell Yourself You Will” crashes in with Abraham roaring in sync with a high-string guitar riff, before a gnomic call-and-response (“Oracle!” “New gods!”) introduces a crowd of other voices. The result is a multi-instrument superhook—and an especially glossy, refined version of the kind of hardcore-motivational anthem the band has been writing for years. The thundering “Divining Gods” even sees Abraham taking on the weight of the song’s melody right from its opening salvo: “I can’t escape this feeling/This ain’t a secular society.”“Divining Gods” takes on the classic punk concern of idolatry—the false gods we worship, from billionaires to rockstars to billionaire rockstars—and inverts it. “We’ll make our gods where we can find them,” Abraham chokes out, making it sound less like an indictment and more like a matter of survival. Another Day makes this move repeatedly: It insists on seeing simply making it through as a cause for celebration. On “Stimming,” Abraham describes playing music with his friends as a protective ward against collapse: “My stim protects/From the ways I could get/If there wasn’t a way to just play and forget,” he yowls, making the words sound like an exaltation.",Rock,7.3
91,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit an essential 1979 example of self-described Great Black Music from a tight-knit collective that embraced traditional and experimental forms all at once. On May 8, 1965, a group of musicians gathered at a house on the South Side of Chicago. They’d been summoned there, via postcards mailed out by four local peers, to discuss the founding of a new collective, devoted to generating fresh opportunities for artists engaged in what they called, simply, “creative music.”At one point during the meeting, a saxophonist named Gene Easton summed up the frustrations shared by many in attendance. “We’re locked up in a system,” he said, “and if you don’t express in the system that is known, you’re ostracized.”“But,” he added, “there are far better systems.”By this time, some prominent musicians had famously bucked mainstream jazz conventions, pursuing revolutions either subtle or splashy (see Miles Davis’ Kind of Blue and Ornette Coleman’s The Shape of Jazz to Come, respectively). But change in jazz still came with controversy: John Coltrane, for example, was alienating some critics and peers with an increasingly abstract style. For an average working jazz musician, especially outside the hotbed of New York, who wanted to keep gigging while also aspiring to engage with vanguard sounds—let alone one, who like some present at that 1965 South Side meeting, was wary of pledging allegiance to jazz, or any other style—it’s easy to see why open expression still felt risky.When Easton spoke of feeling “locked up,” he was talking in musical terms. But his desire to transcend creative restriction signified a higher purpose for the nascent Chicago collective, one that would open up new avenues for Black musicians seeking to thrive beyond category or genre. The group, which would soon dub itself the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, or AACM, would go on to have an immeasurable impact on the course of jazz, experimental music, contemporary classical, and other proudly unclassifiable styles, from the mid-’60s up through the present.A short list of the major artists to emerge from the AACM includes two Pulitzer Prize honorees (2016 winner Henry Threadgill and 2013 finalist Wadada Leo Smith), various NEA Jazz Masters (including Muhal Richard Abrams, the group’s co-founder and longtime musical and intellectual anchor, as well as Anthony Braxton, Amina Claudine Myers and Threadgill) and younger luminaries such as Nicole Mitchell, guitarist Jeff Parker, and cellist Tomeka Reid. But of all the musicians ever to carry the flag for the organization’s better system, perhaps none embodied its core principles of limitless aesthetics, self-determination, and solidarity among individuals more aptly than Roscoe Mitchell, Joseph Jarman, Malachi Favors, and Lester Bowie, early members who eventually joined forces as the Art Ensemble of Chicago.",Experimental,9.5
92,"The New Orleans drone duo follows up its 2011 album Common Era with an unexpected pivot into shoegaze. At its best, it makes familiar formulas sound alien. Belong’s music has evolved gradually across two decades of sporadic activity, moving from their abstract drone beginnings toward something resembling actual rock songs. At times, the change seems to have crept up on them. Speaking with an interviewer around the release of their second full-length, 2011’s gothic, expansive Common Era, the New Orleans duo expressed a note of bafflement about the way the album was landing. “People have been citing shoegaze a lot in reference to the new album and that actually took us a bit by surprise,” said Turk Dietrich, adding, “We don’t feel any relation in aesthetic, harmonically or sonically, to most of the artists from the early ’90s shoegaze movement.”If Deitrich and his bandmate Mike Jones once struggled to hear the influence of shoegaze on their music, 13 years later, they seem to have come around to the idea. The duo’s third album, Realistic IX, doesn’t necessarily sound influenced by the shoegaze movement as a whole; it sounds inspired principally by the shoegaze band, My Bloody Valentine—specifically their landmark 1991 album Loveless. Hit play on the album’s opening track, “Realistic (I’m Still Waiting),” and it’s all there right from the jump: the gauzy, smudged guitar riffs; the androgynous angel sighs; that general sense of warp and weft, as if the track itself was being bent out of shape by a gigantic tremolo arm.Living rent-free in another group’s soundworld is seldom a good look—particularly when it’s as distinctive as the one Kevin Shields created. But Dietrich and Jones are seasoned sculptors of sound, with an instinctive grasp of layering textures and shaping feedback. And whereas much of the current crop of shoegaze revivalists approach the sound in a somewhat basic way—bit of fuzz on the guitars, check; vague sense of ennui in the vocals, check—on Realistic IX, Belong have locked on better than most to My Bloody Valentine’s alien side: that vaporous, synthetic quality that made Loveless feel untethered from familiar rock’n’roll touchstones and adrift in the direction of something new.The Shoegaze Revival Hit Its Stride in 2023Luckily, Belong are canny enough not to recreate My Bloody Valentine’s masterwork stroke by stroke. Dietrich and Jones approach the Loveless formula with intent, like detectives reopening a cold case and sifting the evidence in search of a new way forward. Where Loveless featured live drums—albeit sampled and extensively reassembled by Shields—Belong make use of drum machines, giving their rhythms a blockier, more mechanistic feel. And while Loveless’ lyrics are famously hard to parse, Realistic IX takes the spirit of obfuscation further still. “Souvenir” and “Jealousy” follow a familiar verse-chorus progression, but the blurred-out vocals are wholly unintelligible, deployed purely for their sound and feel. Indeed, you get the sense that Dietrich and Jones remain drone to the bone, seeking moments of epiphany not in the stuff of songcraft but in the careful manipulation of texture and tone.",Electronic,7.4
93,"The singer collaborates with Dahi for a genre-blending album that experiments within and beyond R&B—always guided by her expansive, cotton-candy soft soprano. Ravyn Lenae’s 2022 debut, HYPNOS, established her as a chameleon, adept at blending cushy R&B with her own futurist styles. While this approach placed the 25-year-old singer-songwriter among this generation’s innovators, her follow-up, Bird’s Eye, is a deliberate shift toward a more boundless exploration. For this album, Lenae and executive producer Dahi looked to create something new and formless, pivoting if the music ever felt, as he explained, “too R&B.” While HYPNOS showcased the fluidity of R&B, Bird’s Eye is more varied: Lenae experiments like she’s an alchemist in an R&D lab, trialing new combinations of downtempo guitar, gentle reggae-pop, and even a stuttering, Brainfeeder-esque beat.On Bird’s Eye, Lenae isn’t abandoning R&B altogether but rather discovering and rediscovering pockets for her evolving emotions. The production spans greasy electro zaps, swirling pop, and taut rock, like on opener ""Genius,” where her signature, sage-scented falsetto pierces through a strutting rhythm that’s like a distant cousin to “Billie Jean.” Lenae sings as if she’s whispering from another lifetime with the gift of perspective, explaining, “Paradise takes a little patience/Give it time.” Her music is contemplative, and Bird’s Eye reflects the slow-going part of her self-discovery journey. She’s still deciphering anxieties around love, grief, and self-doubt, but feeling more unconfined than ever.Realistically, growth happens in increments, with build-ups and setbacks. Along the way, Lenae challenges her partners and her loved ones to join her in pushing past discomfort. On the tough, grungy “Love Me Not,” she attends to her romantic desires, waffling between feelings for an ex (“Oh no, I don’t need you, but I miss you come here”). Its softer counterpart, “Love Is Blind,” floats over a supple drum beat and climactic sitar solo, elevating her voice into a pitch that sounds like a lonely witch casting a spell. On “One Wish,” a warm, lush ballad, she tries to blot out the stains of her father’s absence with clarion reflection: “Called me on my birthday/I thought you’d be on your way,” she sings, her wispy vocals drifting amid woozy strings as she speaks for her 10-year-old self. Childish Gambino steps in as a surrogate, crooning from her father’s perspective in brief Frank Ocean-coded blurts, offering a strange sense of comfort. The song is a gorgeous, tender paean to stolen connections, and her dad didn’t hear it until he filmed his appearance in the music video—a testament to Lenae’s willingness to allow her vulnerability to unfold in real time.Even in the album’s meekest moments (the slightly too slack “From Scratch”), it’s easy to get lost in her expansive soprano. On “Bad Idea,” she swats at a sweet-talker in speedy run-on sentences reminiscent of Bow Wow and Ciara’s “Like You.” Her sleek purrs sync beautifully with Ty Dolla $ign’s assured rasp on “Dream Girl,” like she’s Catwoman creeping through a field of glistening keys. The coy, ’80s-tinged track captures summer weekend-in-the-park bliss with slick, watery strings and guitar licks, while “Candy” pairs her lithe, cackling vocals with a lilting lover’s rock groove. Transitioning from those lighter moments into the deeper introspection of “Pilot,” the album’s penultimate track, Lenae searches for belonging beside a crackling fire, lamenting, “Maybe I’m contagious/The way that I can push anyone away.” These shadows of doubt give the album its quaint, mercurial feel, deepening Lenae’s quest for understanding. Bird’s Eye situates her as a consummate thrill-seeker with limitless curiosity, restricted only by the uncertainties in her own mind.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

94,"On an album filled with A-list producers and magnificent beats, the San Francisco rapper skates by with simplistic, autopilot rhymes. Has a rapper ever cared less than Larry June? For 15 years the San Francisco native has coasted on melodic G-funk beats—courtesy of either Cardo or one of Cardo’s many imitators—adorning them with autopilot rhymes and the most tedious ad-libs (“Oh my god!” “Goddamn!” “Good job, Larry!”) known to man. June cruises along on instinct, his casual affect reflecting his producers’ languid tempos. His penchant for luxuries great and small, Supras and smoothies, lends him something of an everyman quality, but even that’s contradicted by his insipid hustle-culture mantras. When he breaks into motivational platitudes (“Keep going, Larry!”), you find yourself bracing for an Herbalife pitch.Doing It for Me (who else would he be doing it for?) assembles the usual roster of A-list producers: Harry Fraud, Cookin Soul, and Jose Rios are all aboard. It’s some of the best music June’s compiled to date, further exposing his lackadaisical tendencies. “Magnum P.I.” weaves a fuzzy guitar, winding bassline, and purring synth into a lush, suggestive wash; June arrives in a Rolls-Royce sipping jasmine tea and clocks out in under two minutes. He’s here solely to fill space: “I’m all on FaceTime wit’ her, I’m kinda feelin’ this bitch/I love how that bitch talk, it’s so appealin’ and shit.” Anyone else would’ve considered this a reference track.Plenty of rappers owe their success to proximity, to being in the room whenever a great beat came on: Mack 10, Le$, any number of L.A. County weed-carriers who lucked into Battlecat tracks. (Jay Worthy can’t rap like Nas, but Nas doesn’t pick beats like Jay Worthy.) The job is to stay out of the way, and June has a rare talent for mucking things up. “Where I’m Going” and “Real Talk, Pt. 2” are aggravatingly simplistic, rhyming the same words for verses at a time. “Cleaning My Spot (Interlude)” is a three-minute humblebrag, June cataloging all the stuff in his house he has to dust. His bulleted diaries are static and repetitive, evoking uncanny solitude: He skims bank statements, sends a few texts, checks his oil gauge, and drinks orange juice. There isn’t a single guest across Doing It for Me’s 15 tracks—June has a house full of toys, and no one to play with.If he’s a lone wolf on record, June’s vacation-rap philosophy has been embraced by a growing cohort of rappers spanning the Gulf Coast through Texas and points west. Layering ’80s soul samples with 808 drums and semi-improvised lifestyle bars, they’re prone to stock imagery: palm trees, turn-of-the-century imports, and Diamond Collection sportswear. Producers Tavaras Jordan and DJ Mr. Rogers are disciples of Houston legend DJ Screw, adapting the woozy tempos and verse-hook structures of his ’90s work. But the movement’s origins date to 2004, when Lil Wayne boasted he was done writing rhymes—to hear him tell it, everything from Tha Carter on was a glorified freestyle. His protégé Curren$y seized the baton with an assembly-line approach, churning out low-overhead projects credited to individual producers, often just weeks apart.",Rap,5.8
95,"In a new collaboration with producer James Riotto, John Vanderslice strikes a fascinating balance between his art-rock inclinations and his newfound passion for exploratory electronic music. Four years after his first direct-to-computer release, John Vanderslice’s devotion to digital has not flagged. The artist whose commitment to analog recording and vintage gear got him profiled in the New Yorker has embraced the possibilities of Ableton Live with the zeal of a convert. And whatever Vanderslice’s Damascus moment was—in interviews, he’s alternately credited being stuck at home early in the pandemic and watching a friend DJ under the influence of Silk Road molly—the shift has been complete. Beginning with 2020’s eeeeeeep! EP, Vanderslice’s finely wrought songwriting went from sharing space with his plugin and programming experiments to ceding it to them. Last year’s CRYSTALS 3.0 was essentially deconstructed glitch, with a lone indie-rock track sticking out like a hacked webstream. Internet ephemera entered his vocab; he started giving his songs titles like “cracked pass words” and “riingtones (78 BPM)” and “sitemap/raytheon technologies.” One such title, from 2022’s d E A T h ~ b U g (credited to ORANGEPURPLEBEACH), summarized his stylistic about-face wonderfully: “admin reveal / take cover”.On Street View, Vanderslice finds a balance between his headlong embrace of electronic production and his longstanding art-rock inclinations. On previous efforts, he appeared giddy with newfound possibilities, like a teen working a cracked copy of FL Studio. With Google Earth—a collaboration with producer and longtime friend James Riotto (Jamie xx, Strand of Oaks, Ezra Furman)—experimentation is still key to his process, but now it’s lab quality. Street View originated as a series of glorified jam sessions in which Riotto and Vanderslice would run MIDI channels between paired Elektron Monomachines and Machinedrums, trying to spark happy harmonic accidents that couldn’t be replicable. There’s nothing shaggy about the results—in classic John Vanderslice tradition, the album clocks in at 35 minutes—but Street View maintains twinned senses of play and purpose.A good deal of that focus may come from Riotto, a jazz acolyte who trained as an upright bassist. His debut album, 2022’s Trailing Speed Lines, was like a sedate reflection of Vanderslice’s stylistic upheaval, fluctuating between chamber pop and sequencer workouts. Street View merges these approaches into a kind of third-stream folktronica, patiently developed and grandly austere. On opening track “deep sea leaks,” Google Earth are a pair of ECM post-boppers, teasing out a series of melodic figures before settling on a regal six-note motif, eventually joined by Nicole McCabe on alto sax. As the programming morphs from patter to pulse, they introduce drummer Jason Slota with the steady hand of seasoned tape splicers. The foreboding “tendril embrace” loads Slota into a capsule and dispatches him to a craggy ice planet. By track’s end, his real-time reporting has turned into distorted crashes; the synths fire up a distress signal before flatlining.",Experimental,8.0
96,"On a frenetic album that tests the limits of his trolling, JPEGMAFIA hints at the delicate balance of truth and fiction behind his confrontational mix of noise, rap, and punk. The exact moment that NBA player Dillon Brooks lost the mandate of heaven: After poking the bear of LeBron James in the 2023 playoffs, failing to live up to his own slanderous trash-talk while his aggressive style of play floundered on the court, Brooks unceremoniously hit free agency as the Memphis Grizzlies leaked that he wouldn’t be re-signed “under any circumstances.” Brooks’ story appears as an omen on “i scream this in the mirror before i interact with anyone,” the opening track on JPEGMAFIA’s fifth studio album, I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU. In the first lines, the 34-year-old Baltimore rapper—whose iconoclastic presence is forged on a confrontational mix of noise, rap, and punk—likens himself to a worse version of Brooks as cymbals titter in the background. It’s an initiation to JPEG’s caustic humor laced with a smidge of accidental wisdom: You can play the role of the tireless provocateur as long as you continue to deliver.On I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU, JPEG entrenches himself in the agitator role. The follow-up to his 2023 Danny Brown collaboration Scaring the Hoes is blanketed in frenetic energy, as if JPEG can’t decide where to aim first. At times his extremely online subject matter takes the bloom off his writing. But his innate ability to shift between breakneck flows amid chaotic production buoys the album.In a 2023 interview, JPEG said that he aspires to create music that “tears you out of yourself.” On I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU, it feels as though he’s tearing in 30 directions at once, incorporating a dizzying mix of genres seemingly at random. The imperfect marriage of a 2014 Future sample and a persistent whirring sound on “New Black History” registers as grating rather than electrifying; his chants and growls in “vulgar display of power” are eroded by a blistering rock backdrop. At other points his glitchy, staccato raps fit seamlessly with the production’s entropy: on “it’s dark and hell is hot,” a 170 bpm Brazilian funk production assisted by DJ RaMeMes, or over a staticky Jade sample on “I’ll Be Right There.” As it did on his 2018 release Veteran, JPEG’s ability to walk the line between distortion and discord permits the industrial chaos to feel somehow familiar—as if the only thing more jarring would be unified sound direction.No matter the subject, JPEG’s raps never shy away from confrontation (he described the Drake disses on “New Black History” and “it’s dark and hell is hot” as “throwaway bars”). On I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU, he continues to hip fire with an air of superiority: “Fake-plug-talkin’ Tubi rappers/Got a machine behind ’em, and still they can’t fill up capacity with they raps,” he spits on “SIN MIEDO.” There’s room to take aim at white people who act Black and shit-talkers with their own skeletons in the closet, all while keeping pace with a fun Denzel Curry appearance. His pop culture references are simple and high-powered: Calling himself the “Black Michael Phelps” is objectively funny. The nonstop airing of grievances is entertaining, but eventually it can feel like JPEG’s off-the-cuff trolls are reaching critical mass. There’s wanton carelessness in using “African booty scratcher” as an insult while also claiming that he scares people “that ain’t got no Black friends.” He’ll go and liken himself to the IDF on the five-minute opus “Exmilitary,” then name the next track “JIHAD JOE,” not bothering to adjust for the contradictions between his personality and political commentary.",Rap,6.9
97,"Four years after an unexpected comeback LP, the Los Angeles country-punk veterans return with their final album. They sound vigorous and assured, finding fresh inspiration in familiar sounds. Billed as the band’s final album, Smoke & Fiction is a fulfilling closing chapter for X, the pioneering band whose breakneck rhythms and turbo-charged rockabilly riffs came blazing out of Los Angeles’s nascent punk scene in the late 1970s. Forty-four years after their debut, 1980’s Los Angeles, the group sounds vigorous and assured, finding fresh inspiration in familiar sounds, emotions, and ideas.Chaos was central to X’s appeal in the early days. The intertwined lead vocals of John Doe and Exene Cerevenka suggested that the one-time couple were embroiled in an ongoing argument; guitarist Billy Zoom added to the frenzy, though he never forgot the swing of early rock’n’roll, even when chasing after the velocity of the Ramones. Inherently empathetic to the needs of his singers, drummer D.J. Bonebrake provided a steady anchor—though he, too, could occasionally get caught up in the band’s feverish excitement.The band thrived on tension, channeling interpersonal drama and clashes with the culture at large into a potent songbook that sustained them decades after they stopped writing new material. In 2020, following a succession of lineup changes, hiatuses, and reunions, the group unexpectedly returned with the sharp, lively ALPHABETLAND, its first album of new material from the original quartet in 35 years.The focus and urgency of Smoke & Fiction makes ALPHABETLAND look like a dry run. Part of that stems from the palpable sense that the band can feel the clock ticking away. Frustrated that they were unable to tour ALPHABETLAND, which landed in the early days of the pandemic, and keenly aware of their advancing ages—Cervenka and Bonebrake are pushing 70, while Doe and Zoom are over that line—X chose to re-run the play one more time. Teaming again with producer Rob Schnapf, who also helmed ALPHABETLAND, X knocked out Smoke & Fiction in a few days this past January—a working band working in the method that suits them. (To underscore the impending sense of finality, they’ve dubbed their new tour the End Is Near.)Clocking in at 28 minutes, roughly the same length as Los Angeles, Smoke & Fiction sounds as if X is drawing inspiration from its long history, purposefully recalling the kinetic rock’n’roll of the band’s early records for Slash. As Doe explained to the Los Angeles Times, “It’s not in our nature to reinvent things. We have a clear idea of who we are.” As robust as they sound, Doe’s and Cervenka’s voices show signs of wear, while the rhythms feel heavier than in the past, even when the tempos quicken. These elements lend natural grain to the music, adding depth to the tales of aging that riddle Smoke & Fiction.",Rock,7.7
98,"The old Jack White suddenly steps out from behind the curtain with 42 minutes of amp-busting blues punk. Even the last couple of White Stripes albums weren’t this stacked. Somewhere between his increasingly fussy solo albums, and certainly by the time he started policing audiences’ cell phones, it became clear that Jack White was not the uninhibited nonconformist he played so convincingly with the White Stripes. Since that duo disbanded in 2011, White has systematically sucked almost all the fun from his image, revealing that this avatar of effortless cool was actually bound by a complicated code of unwritten rules he was more than happy to lecture music publications about. It’s been a heel turn akin to watching the coolest senior in your high school return as the district’s biggest stickler of a substitute teacher.What a difference one record can make. Of all the considerable feats pulled by White’s raucous, ripping, unrelenting sixth solo album, No Name, perhaps the most remarkable is how cleanly it wipes the slate after a decade-plus of traditionalist scolding, divisive experiments, and creative misfires. No Name reconnects White with the primal impulses that made the Stripes so undeniable. It’s a comeback that instantly announces itself as a contender for White’s best solo record: 42 minutes of amp-busting blues punk that reveals the old Jack White was behind the curtain all along, hungry and undiminished, waiting for the right moment to make his reentrance.Thanks to savvy guerilla marketing, No Name arrives with its lore prewritten. It was surprise-released July 19 at White’s Third Man Records shops, where uncredited, white-sleeved pressings were slipped into the bags of unsuspecting customers. This wasn’t like the time White hid 7""s inside of reupholstered furniture, though. He wanted the world to hear and discover this record, and Third Man’s social accounts encouraged fans to “rip it” and share. The project’s raw immediacy initially suggested it might be throwaway, a palette cleanser before White resumed his usual studio tinkering, but its triple-octane riffage and seething, sticky hooks pointed to something more lasting and substantial. Even the last couple of White Stripes albums weren’t this stacked.The all killer, no filler ethos is a far cry from Fear of the Dawn, the absolutely gonzo solo record White released in 2022. Where that record invited listeners to marvel at its virtuosity and gawk at its sadistically counterintuitive creative choices, No Name leans into his most intuitive, meat-and-potato impulses. Opener “Old Scratch Blues” thrashes with the gravity of Led Zeppelin’s most titanic riffs, while “That’s How I’m Feeling” plays like a belated stab at one last great, aughts-style rock revival single. “Bombing Out” may be the most convincing two and half minutes of scuzzy hardcore you’ll hear from a 49-year-old this year.",Rock,7.6
99,"Backed by his live band, the rapper remixes and elaborates the autobiographical themes and gospel uplift of 2023’s Michael. Twenty years ago, Killer Mike was the upstart landing I’m-up-next spots on Jay-Z and Outkast records. His verse on Big Boi’s “Flip Flop Rock,” which features Jay, casts Mike’s good fortune as both salvation and destiny. “I foregoed the crime and I focused on rhyme/Focused on every word and line/Like a young Cassius Clay in his prime/I was born to talk shit and prove mine,” he raps with brio. This sense of deliverance has remained a fixture of his work, from the hopeful “gospel music for the ghetto” of his mixtape days, to the rowdy agitprop of R.A.P. Music and Run the Jewels, through last year’s ponderous bildungsroman Michael. He often likens music to a religious experience, zooming in on the ways his career has transported him mentally and materially to a better life.Michael & the Mighty Midnight Revival, Songs for Sinners and Saints continues this tradition. Part remix album, part somber coda to the gospel-influenced Michael, it burrows further into Mike’s formative memories, beliefs, and sounds. Backed by his touring band the Mighty Midnight Revival, and producers and guests from the many eras of his career, Killer Mike cycles through trap, gospel, and Memphis rap as he extols the virtues of staying the course. “I’m bearin’ witness,” he says on the intro, invoking the custom of Southern Black church testimonies. This is rap as outreach.The album comes six months after a whirlwind Grammy night during which Killer Mike won three awards and got arrested for an altercation with a security guard. He describes the evening’s whiplash on the bluesy “Humble Me,” likening his booking to the biblical story of Daniel in the lion’s den and boasting that he was proud to be handcuffed because he shares the experience with his civil rights heroes. After spending the night praying, he’s seemingly rewarded when the next day, his son is confirmed for a kidney transplant. Like many Killer Mike stories, the tale is dramatic and a bit self-aggrandizing—is getting cuffed at the Grammys really the same as being targeted by the FBI?—but Mike’s faith powers his performance. He raps with the conviction of someone who has been touched by the divine and feels newly attuned to its power.The production, mostly helmed by Cuz Lightyear, plays up the feeling of spiritual awakening. The slow, open arrangements use jubilant choir fills, warm keyboard and organ melodies, and swinging rhythms to channel gospel uplift. While a few songs boom and rattle, most sway with relief. “Slummer 4 Junkies” combines the Michael tracks “Slummer” and “Something for Junkies” into a slow-burning epic that swells with the Mighty Midnight Revival’s joyful harmonies and then contracts into a penitent elegy. The songs felt episodic on Michael, but combined they evoke the haze of memory, the narratives blurring together.",Rap,7.0
100,"The MPC wizard’s ethereal synths are the perfect complement to Harmony Korine’s over-the-top spectacle, playing up its impressionistic textures and humanizing its hallucinatory violence. It’s the end of the world, and everyone is fighting for loot drops. The chorister singing the requiem is Harmony Korine, who since Gummo has found increasingly kaleidoscopic ways to depict the beauty and horror of a society eating itself. If Spring Breakers vaulted his perverse visions into the mainstream bacchanal of red Solo cups and multi-floor EDM ragers, his latest film flips the script for a more isolated age. AGGRO DR1FT, shot entirely in eye-dilating thermal vision, is a nightmare of few words: Miami assassins hunt each other down, praying for an end to the violence as motion-capture demons haunt the skies above them. Cartoonish side characters dispense assignments with the mechanical exaggeration of Grand Theft Auto NPCs. Pole dancers spark firecrackers up and down their bodies while dissolving into a quagmire of robotic A.I. slush. Travis Scott shows up. Either you’ll think the whole thing is mind-numbingly tasteless, or you’ll find a sick truth in its garish absurdity.AraabMuzik’s voided-out score is key to the film’s hypebeast ego-death aura. Tapping the Rhode Island producer for a project like this may seem like a throwback—he hasn’t really seen the spotlight since his days sharing festival billings with Zedd and Clams Casino (even if his trance-meets-trap 2011 debut, Electronic Dream, still sounds as euphoric as ever). But listening to his music for AGGRO DR1FT, it’s hard to fathom that he and Korine didn’t link up sooner. AraabMuzik’s bottle-service transcendence clearly inhabits the same universe as Spring Breakers, a molly-fueled fantasy reaching longingly toward the heavens. Rather than sliding his usual rapidfire MPC finger drumming into the picture, however, AraabMuzik ventures into new realms, luxuriating in a pure synth soundscape that renders Korine’s dystopian hellworld one tone at a time.Drawing on the language of gaming and experimental film, AGGRO DR1FT deals mainly in impressionistic texture (it has more in common with one of Phil Solomon’s PlayStation elegies than the shoot-em-ups it pretends to be). AraabMuzik’s soundtrack similarly hits on the most basic sensory levels. Apparently texted to Korine in bits and pieces without seeing the movie, AraabMuzik’s score is collected as a series of loops often lasting a minute or less, alongside a handful of slightly longer tracks that take more room to stretch their legs. In the film, Korine slows these snippets down, speeds them up, and stretches them out until they glow like magma. Perusing them all at once creates the same sensation as scrolling through levels on a mission select screen.",Electronic,7.6
101,"Amid the rich textures and hushed production of this playful, soulful six-song EP, the San Bernardino native radiates sensuality—and fun. When Moses Sumney sings, “I am not a woman, I am not a man” in something close to his speaking voice on “Hey Girl,” I thought, Right on. He is himself and his artistic forebears too—namely, the Prince who offered a similar affirmation in “I Would Die 4 U” Then the kicker: “I am an amoeba.” The San Bernardino native of Ghanaian parents sings over squishy, squirrelly tracks whose post-Maxwell R&B foundations accommodate damaged rock rifflets and modest gospel overtones; you might imagine him practicing vocal runs in the bedroom before church. The six-song EP Sophcore—a curriculum vitae outlining his robust laryngeal resources—recaps Sumney’s achievements and sets up what audiences might expect from a new full-length statement. It’s a tease in the best sense.Four years ago, on his breakthrough album, grae, Sumney expressed the yearnings of a soul sonic force who loved being, as he sang on one of its most powerful tracks, “neither/nor.” That album’s “Virile,” a collaboration with industrial rock act Yvette, regarded masculinity as a land worth invading with a conquering army. To master such whisper-to-a-scream dynamics requires a sense of self that eschews bluster but is plenty assured.A collaboration with Portland producer Graham Jonson, who goes by quickly, quickly, yields Sophcore’s prettiest and liveliest moments. “Gold Coast” begins as a sensual, puttering thing indebted to Bjork’s Vespertine. Sumney’s chalky falsetto complements and works against the plucked guitars, distorted multi-tracked vocals, and synths; his impressionistic lyrics (“Talk in tongues, testify/Sunrise skin, color of clay”) say no thanks to coherence, bless them. A symphony of gurgles and music-box melodies cushions “I’m Better (I’m Bad),” in which Sumney recreates with louche delight a dialogue between himself and a feminized object of desire.Over Sophcore’s recombinant grooves, Sumney radiates a sense of fun. Confidence in his vocal talents doesn’t congeal into self-regard. Turns out he’s right: Trills and melisma suit arrangements that swell and contract like protoplasmic organisms. The finger-snapping rhythm track on the closing “Love’s Refrain” is almost an afterthought, a metronome to remind Sumney that his fascinations remain earthbound despite the stratospheric vantage point of his vowel experiments. “I was in my world, you were in yours too,” he coos, “so let’s refrain.” From what—independence or romance? Duetting with himself into infinity, he deepens the enigmas.",Rock,8.0
102,"On his first solo billing in six years, the guitarist—a member of Darkside and Taper’s Choice—bids farewell to NYC. These patient, wistful explorations are heavy on both melody and collaborative spirit. In 2019, Dave Harrington, lifelong New Yorker and stalwart of the city’s avant-garde jazz and improv scene, moved to Los Angeles with his partner. But before he left, the guitarist gathered some of the city’s best players, both contemporaries like bassist Spencer Zahn and longtime heroes like Steven Bernstein, and made one last New York record. Fittingly, Skull Dream is an album of patient, wistful explorations that seem unable to keep from casting their eyes California’s way, even as they celebrate a lifetime of rich musical relationships. The album is at times funereal and at times shot through with optimism; its generosity of spirit shines so brightly, its desire to be in two places at once so palpable that it blots out all boundaries—between places, between jazz and noise and Americana, but also between the songs themselves. If that means it gets a little same-y, well, so does a cross-country move.Harrington first came to prominence in Darkside, his collaboration with electronic producer Nicolás Jaar, where the hard slink of his stippling phrases—part soukous, part erotic murmur—dug creases in the otherwise placid surface of Jaar’s productions. Listening to his playing on their instant-classic 2013 album Psychic sometimes feels like watching someone run their tongue over black velvet. A regular at eclectic Lower East Side club Nublu, he quickly installed himself at L.A.’s ETA after the move, becoming a regular player in the surging local jazz scene. He also joined up with Real Estate’s Alex Bleeker and Vampire Weekend’s Chris Tomson, as well as keyboardist Zach Tenorio-Miller, to form the instantly beloved jam band Taper’s Choice, turning their mostly straightforward choogle inside out with effects-heavy leads that sometimes sound like they’re beamed in via choppy satellite.On Skull Dream, Harrington’s guitar tone is a little hoarse and a little spacey, and he often uses it to tangle notes into tumbleweeds, sounding like the 1980s version of Jerry Garcia trying his hand at some Duane Eddy and Link Wray. His last major release, 2019’s Pure Imagination, No Country, was credited to the Dave Harrington Group, and while Skull Dream’s solo billing might suggest a showcase for the guitarist’s grandest riffs and flashiest licks, he brings the same cooperation and composure to these songs as to his other projects, a collaborator in his own music.In opener “Dust String Peaks,” Harrington laces his patient lead through a sighing choir of saxophones and clarinets. It’s the kind of plaintive and plainly beautiful melodic line that sometimes made the Band sound like they were imagining their own funerals. The guitar and horns stroll over the patient strike of the drums with so much dignity, it feels valedictory, like the ensemble wants to sum up decades of accrued wisdom while it still has the time. Harrington occasionally allows himself a showy moment, as when the juicy horns of “Acid Western” give way to a guitar that sounds like a soprano sax, then an overdriven harmonica, and finally a wordless vocalist. But his instrument is largely beside the point, just one ray among many in the shifting light that shines and fades in what one track dubs a “Box of Sun.”",Electronic,7.4
103,"The Texas singer uses experimental vocal collages set against actual Lynchian backdrops to create a uniquely off-kilter kind of evanescence. The presence of director David Lynch’s name atop the new Chrystabell album, Cellophane Memories, will attract curious ears it might not have otherwise. After a few listens, however, you may wonder less about what Lynch brought to the table, and more about why Chrystabell, a Texas-based singer, is credited just once. Cellophane Memories should be attributed not to Chrystabell but to Chrystabells, plural. The greatest virtue of this beautiful album is how it layers her voice over and over—and over—again.The opening of“With Small Animals” is a prime example of this collage effect—her vocal lines spin free from their ambiguous origin point like threads of an ever-fraying fabric. On “The Sky Falls,” the effect is more strategic, vaguely resembling a classical canon; the pacing of overlaps is ambiguous but still calculable. A synthesizer backdrop lends it an almost irritating texture, giving this seeming evanescence a uniquely off-kilter quality.Cellophane Memories may be pretty, but it’s not easy. On “Reflections in a Blade,” the vocal bits are harshly clipped, providing a fractured view of an uncertain whole. They flicker by, the patterning delicious, forming a jumbled mess of voices. Behind the chorus a lone synth hums, interspersed with what sounds like someone breathing through a saxophone. The majority of the songs have just an instrument or two in the background, but each selection reflects exquisite decision-making. And each production element firmly reflects Lynch’s presence.As a filmmaker, Lynch suffuses his work with sound, from the lush scores that Angelo Badalamenti provided for Twin Peaks and Mulholland Drive, to the essential presence of pop songs, like those of Roy Orbison in Blue Velvet and Chris Isaak in Wild at Heart, all the way back to the radiator drones of his debut, Eraserhead. Lynch’s sonic hallmarks are everywhere on Cellophane Memories, from the earnest treacle of Badalamenti’s backing pads (the composer died in 2022, but is spiritually present here), to the tremolo-thick guitars of Orbison and Isaak, to the haunting rumble favored in his film sound designs. There are also mechanized rhythms—bone machine beats, à la Tom Waits—that bring to mind other Lynch pop forays, most notably his work with the late Julee Cruise, who died the same year as Badalamenti.Chrystabell doesn’t merely sing back-up for herself: The dovetailing of her vocals means you don’t always know what’s the main line, what’s an echo, and what’s an eerie backmasked premonition. Vocally, it’s clear that Cellophane Memories owes a debt to numerous gloomy and dreamy pop concoctions of the past, like Mazzy Star, Cowboy Junkies, Kate Bush, and Nico. There’s also a strong influence of art-pop forebear David Sylvian—whose dramatic, self-correcting melodic arcs she follows as if she wrote a dissertation on the subject.",Pop,7.3
104,"The rapper and visual artist’s debut compilation is an intimate opus of lo-fi sampledelia, a 50-song catalog of memories, half-thoughts, and moments of discovery. At a June event commemorating Anysia Kym’s Truest, DORIS rasped breathily over his own floor-rumbling tracks: a curious spectacle, considering that his “floor-rumbling tracks” are woozy bedroom ballads, less Mike Dean than Dean Blunt. Take “Usher,” the airy one-off single he dropped via MIKE’s 10k label three years ago. A languid Enchantment loop longs for “Gloria, my Gloria” while DORIS dawdles through the mix, chirping about weed—listen closely and you can hear him choking on the smoke. It’s beautiful in an unpolished way, like early Ariel Pink or R. Stevie Moore sending heartfelt prayers through hissing mics. Now picture him onstage, swaddled in feedback, speaker rattles, and the bitcrush of his own cranked-up backing track, no longer whispering but screaming through songs that lend themselves to silent weeping. Raw passion permeates even his breeziest, most distant dreamscapes. “Real and straight up,” he said in a recent interview: “That’s what I want to be, 100 percent of the time.”DORIS is Frank Dorrey, a Jersey-raised multi-hyphenate who first came to public attention as a visual artist whose uncanny portraits have adorned album sleeves and limited-edition skate decks. His few press appearances portray him as a cerebral recluse, happier to speak from a SoundCloud account than a soapbox. The statements he made from said SoundCloud account were surreal—fleeting fever dreams that rode the same psychedelic highs as his eerie, amorphous Picsart prints. He chose the name DORIS partly as an homage to Earl Sweatshirt: an artsy young introvert resonating with the mastermind behind I Don’t Like Shit, I Don’t Go Outside.Dorrey is still somewhat shy, but he’s stepping out more often. (Pitchfork caught up with him earlier this year at the opening of a joint art exhibition with Brayan Ramales.) He’s also gotten far more comfortable in his own voice—comfortable enough to drop a sprawling 50-track opus without stumbling across the same idea twice. Last month, he independently released Ultimate Love Songs Collection, a glut of lo-fi demos largely ripped from his SoundCloud. It scans a lot like other ambitious hard drive clean-outs, à la Roaches 2012-2019 or Sent From My Telephone, but manages to remain intimate—and wildly fun—where the “longform idea dump” genre so runs aground. Ultimate Love Songs Collection doesn’t feel low-effort or self-aggrandizing—it shares the cathartic release of singing in the shower. “I’m just riding on the beat, I just like the way it sounds,” a giddy DORIS admits on “Baby reign,” audibly lost in the sauce. Unlike much of underground rap’s young vanguard, he isn’t cosplaying his influences so much as performing simple passions: his own company, the songs he’s stoked on, and the weed he’s smoking while trying to loop his favorite parts. Deep as it sits within his universe, the music is familiar enough to nestle comfortably within ours.",Rap,8.3
105,"This invigorating compilation of African dance music from the 1980s and ’90s is a nostalgic snapshot of the Ugandan DJ’s youth—and a celebration of the selector’s ability to connect disparate sounds. Ndola, Zambia’s third largest city, is best known internationally for copper mining and the imposing Levy Mwanawasa stadium. On the evidence of A Dancefloor in Ndola, a new compilation from East African DJ Kampire, the city should also be celebrated for its joyful party vibes and cosmopolitan dancefloors, whose music is so riotously funky it threatens to shake the Levy Mwanawasa to its foundations.Kampire, born in Kenya to Ugandan parents, lived in Ndola from the ages of two to 18. A Dancefloor in Ndola is inspired by the songs she absorbed during this period—in particular, via her father’s record collection—including a range of music from Eastern and Southern Africa, from soukous to township bubblegum, drawn largely from the 1980s and early ’90s. There is a heavy emphasis on women singers, including Congolese heroes Pembey Sheiro and Feza Shamamba and South Africa’s V-Mash and Di Groovy Girls.The album isn’t mixed but it’s admirably constructed. Kampire, like any DJ worth their salt, is skilled at teasing out connections between disparate sounds. A Dancefloor in Ndola shows the art of the DJ as selector, joining the dots between musical trends in a way that flows effortlessly onto the dancefloor.Several years and thousands of miles lie between Princess Aya Sarah’s “O Wina Tienge” and the African House Party Project ft. Splash, Patricia Majalisa, and Dalom Kids’ “P-Coq,” the first and third songs on this compilation. But Kampire’s clever selection highlights the similarities between the florid, funky soukous of the “O Wina Tienge” and the rolling pop house of “P-Coq,” with sturdy kick-drum thump, call-and-response vocals, and late-’80s/early-’90s sonic palette running through both songs’ sinuous grooves. The way that “P-Coq” then gives way to V-Mash’s gloriously headstrong “Naughty Boy,” whose clubby production and vocal strut suggest a South African Madonna at her most Brat, makes for a jubilant extension of musical throughlines.This combination—bass-drum-heavy beats, time-stamped electronic instrumentation, and intricate vocal arrangements—dominates A Dancefloor in Ndola. The parallels with wider club culture are self-evident. Princesse Mansia M’bila’s “Ngoma Mansia” and Samba Mapangala and Orchestra Virunga’s “Mashariki” are absolutely pounding, repetitive and hypnotic in a way that will be familiar to anyone who has experienced Tanzanian singeli (or, indeed, emerged from a club into broad daylight). But there are enough exceptions to the rule for the compilation to breathe. The syncopated saxophone skip of Lady Isa’s “Djambo” provides blissful air midway through, while Founders Band’s “Kimbera” tops off the record on a less regimented note. Its fuzzy and slightly imperfect sound turns out to be the perfect way to end A Dancefloor in Ndola’s theoretical night out.",Strut,7.7
106,"Brian Leeds—aka ambient-techno maestro Huerco S.—presents a collection of dubby, foggy dance tracks where mystery feels like the main event. Six years ago, Brian Leeds—better known as the ambient-techno producer Huerco S.—invented a new alias, Loidis, for a one-off release. A Parade, in the Place I Sit, the Floating World (& All Its Pleasures) shared certain key characteristics with Huerco S. records. It was suggestively murky, dusted with dull glitter, propelled by four-on-the-floor beats that were more implicit than explicit. One track was 10 minutes long; another ran to more than a quarter of an hour, burbling away like an enchanted brook. It seemed to say, Dance or drift off—it’s all the same to me.The music’s dubby pulse and foggy sound design nodded to a particular set of Y2K-era influences—Basic Channel and their Chain Reaction kin, Jan Jelinek, Vladislav Delay—that were canonical though not, in 2018, particularly fashionable. In the intervening years, those sounds have crept back around, rediscovered by a generation that wasn’t there for the first wave. Artists like Purelink, J. Albert, and James Devane have all been toying with styles associated with the German minimal techno of the early 2000s. Many of these artists, following Huerco S.’s lead, seem inspired primarily by atmospheric qualities. But on Loidis’ new album, One Day, the Kansas City producer dials up the intensity. Leeds’ first full-length under the alias aims straight for the dancefloor with a collection of trippy, springy tracks that seem designed, like a candy-flipping Energizer Bunny, to thump away until long past sunup.A Parade, in the Place I Sit, the Floating World (& All Its Pleasures) was largely an ambient affair, but One Day’s opening track, “Tell Me,” arrives like a shot across the bow. Its quick-stepping kicks and hi-hats seem designed to match the energetic tempos of 2024’s notoriously demanding dancefloors. The hiccupping bassline pushes against the beat, like a sprinter trying to break out of the pack. In “Wait & See,” which follows, clicky hi-hats rush forward just as impatiently, tripping over their own feet in a headlong dash. “Tequa” is slower and more buoyant, in keeping with the lazy dub techno of 2018’s “A Parade,” but its forceful kick and plunging chord stabs telegraph a determination to dig in for the long haul. Track after track feels like a study in groove science—a little nudge here, a little drag there, and presto: a perpetual motion machine.Once you sink into the music, you start to notice strange things happening in the pockets around those elastic grooves. Little wisps of tone flicker and are extinguished, regular as clockwork. Whisper-soft percussive sounds duck their heads out from behind other, equally evasive sounds, like bashful voyeurs. The central feature of “Love’s Lineaments” is a set of dubbed-out chords that feel like hesitant answers to the up-for-it bassline. With every repetition, they slide a little bit further behind the beat, notes smearing across the stave. You could get lost in a detail like that, following them as they glide, trying to parse their tangled frequencies. Tracking their motions feels like cloudspotting, or trying to fix one’s gaze on a strange bit of flotsam coming around the river’s bend.",Electronic,7.9
107,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit the pop star’s singular 2007 album, her oft-misunderstood comeback and a defining cultural artifact of the dark, trashy, celebrity-driven essence of the aughts. A woman drives fast along the California freeway with the radio screaming, delirious with grief. She does this every morning, dressing quickly in her Beverly Hills home so as to leave no time to think. Changing lanes is like a dance the way she’s trained herself to do it, seamlessly and to the beat. She walks barefoot into gas stations, rinsing down pills with warm Coca-Cola and chatting mindlessly with the attendants. Her marriage is over. Her showbiz career is dead. Her child has been taken away. She is known to cry at parties or get carried home; close friends have come to believe she’s insane. It is only on the freeway, when the music is loud, that she can forget what’s become of her life. To fall asleep she imagines herself on the road: “The Hollywood to the San Bernardino and straight on out, past Barstow, past Baker, driving straight on into the hard white empty core of the world.”How chic the story sounds the way Joan Didion tells it in her 1970 novel Play It as It Lays. The woman is a trainwreck but a sharp and glamorous one, numbing out on pills as a critique of moral rot in 1960s Tinseltown. Books are great that way. Played out in real life in the year 2007, the tale loses its cool; now the woman is a punchline whose endless personal disasters keep a burgeoning new media economy afloat. It seemed that every week, or sometimes even every day, brought a hysterical new headline regarding the downward spiral of America’s pop princess. (“HELP ME!” “INSANE!” “OUT OF CONTROL!”) “We serialize Britney Spears. She’s our President Bush,” said TMZ founder Harvey Levin in a gruesome Rolling Stone cover story from early 2008, which began with Britney wailing in a San Fernando Valley shopping mall as a crowd closed around her with their Sidekick smartphones brandished. “I don’t know who you think I am, bitch,” 26-year-old Spears snarled to a shopgirl approaching for a photo. “But I’m not that person.”What had become of the Southern sweetheart was not a symptom or appraisal of a new century’s decay but the foremost emblem of it, or possibly its cause. A New York Times essay that summed up 2007 as the year of the trainwreck, in which “prominent figures from every arena of public life did harm to their reputations and livelihoods in devastating fashion,” led with a description of Spears’ lifeless performance at the VMAs that fall. “Is there any measurable way to prove what many of us feel in our gut,” the article went on, “that 2007 was the year when the excesses of our most reliably outrageous personalities finally started to feel, well, excessive?” Or was it that the billion-dollar gossip industry, newly powerful online, had willed this chaos into being? It was the dawning of the era of perpetual surveillance, and websites once considered too sketchy to break news were scooping the “real” outlets when it came to all things shallow and macabre.",Pop,8.1
108,"Captured in Chicago in March 2023, the singer-songwriter and his band achieve a sort of dream state, finding otherworldly new forms for familiar songs about rebirth and revelation. One of the words that Bill Callahan uses most frequently on Resuscitate!, a live album recorded in March 2023, is “dreams.” We’re coming in and out of them on “First Bird.” They’re places of transmogrification, danger, and in fact the ultimate reality on “Coyotes.” “Dream, baby, dream,” Callahan seems to ad lib on “Natural Information,” a song about pushing his infant daughter down the street, now reinforced with the greatest lesson this wised-up dad could ever teach her. It’s 11 years since Callahan released his 15th album, Dream River, a record he intended to be the last thing the listener heard at night, guiding them tenderly to their sleep state. Since then, marriage, fatherhood, and a new embrace of expansive thinking have taken the 58-year-old songwriter to a whole other metaphysical plane. I often think of beautiful coincidences as being like an eclipse—two celestial bodies lining up for just a second that you’re lucky enough to catch—and Callahan has become a stargazer for those moments in his writing, especially as he observes the habits of his young family; his melodies, too, have become more open, transcendent, reaching for something beyond.That night at Chicago’s Thalia Hall, Callahan and his band attained a sort of dream state, sounding generative and otherworldly. “The date was mid-point in the tour,” Callahan writes in the accompanying notes, “so I knew we’d be as hot as we were going to get. Not too green, not too brown.” (He also notes that he tries to work only with venues, such as Thalia Hall, outside the Live Nation/Ticketmaster nexus, and maybe that freedom wriggles in.) In opening song “First Bird” alone, Callahan, guitarist Matt Kinsey, tenor sax player Dustin Laurenzi, and drummer Jim White voyage further than most bands ever do in a whole set. It starts off sounding like a mysterious night on the plains, full of skittish life forms, prowling bass, flashes of woodwind. As Callahan grows more fervent, the instruments vibrate with anticipation, and then come to tumble in and out of sync with their leader’s mercurial, deeply felt phrasing. It peaks with Callahan cawing “Tall! Tall! Tall!,” as if he were that titular first bird; after six minutes, the squalling guitar propels a full-band tumbledown climax. Even though parts of this ensemble have been playing together for a long time—and any group with White as its center has magic on its side—the telepathy between them is astonishing.I saw Callahan in London at the outset of this run, in November 2022, and as a veteran fan, it was perhaps my least favorite show of his that I’ve seen. The setlist dwelled largely on his post-pandemic records, as this night in Chicago did, with scant exceptions. I love YTI⅃AƎЯ and Gold Record as much as the next person who loves joy, but why forsake your sweet Smog children! The playing was so digressive—the version of “Coyotes” on Resuscitate! lasts nearly 13 minutes, and many others run to around seven minutes—that I rued what felt like indulgence standing in the way of the old classics.",Rock,7.8
109,"The follow-up to the New York lyricist’s Def Jam debut is a stripped-back canvas for his searing, lived-in stories. His vision is clearer than ever. When Sage Elsesser first started anonymously self-releasing his music, listening to him felt like pressing an ear against a bedroom door, eavesdropping on a troubled man and his muffled prayers. Considering the community he’d sprouted from—fashionable Fairfax kids, skateboards in one hand and sponsorships in the other—his affect was markedly sober, a bare-bones hush that foregrounded little more than pen and paper, rhymes and loops. Since then, each of his albums as Navy Blue has been a study in self-interrogation, reckoning with the things closest to his conscience: family, spirituality, and the voices of his ancestors. All the while, his sound has been steadily evolving from the sparse, confessional-booth digs of his earliest days, branching out to accommodate his expanding worldview. Gradually, the microphone hum has faded, along with the scratchiness of the loops and the grainy languor of those grand piano swells: By last year’s Ways of Knowing, it didn’t sound like we were stealing secrets through a closed door anymore. Navy Blue was presenting a fully-produced snapshot of someone who had grown up.For all its existential baggage, this growth made Navy’s fourth LP feel like a cornerstone of his saga, a glimpse of how he could rap with more than just a distant snare in his headphones. Few moments passed where he was alone—there was constantly a fellow vocalist, a seductive melody, or an ornate live-band arrangement to keep him warm in the dusk of his turmoil. (“I can’t do this shit on my own,” he sang on “Freehold,” and it sounded like it.) Scaling back these accouterments makes Memoirs in Armour, his first release since being dropped by Def Jam, equally raw and rewarding. In a minimal record that elevates his voice, he ventures back into dusty early-career closets, commanding the no-frills confines he once found his footing in. Stripped-down as the music may be, his words carry more than enough weight to fill out the room. On Memoirs, he doesn’t seem nearly as interested in selling soundscapes as sitting us down and telling us difficult stories.Although Navy is rarely preachy, his raps can leave you wondering whether you’re going to hell. Part of this is the sheer mass, the brooding existential glare, of the matters he reckons with: the circularity of life, the looming specter of death, the cathartic gratitude that threads these things together. These are hefty subjects in their own right, though Navy’s message is fortified by his disposition, the steely cadence he’s long wielded to synthesize his heaviest burdens. Stern and unflappable, he spends Memoirs staring you in the eye, daring you to avert your gaze. Fittingly, there’s only one track here (“Running Sand”) that eases his onslaught with something close to a chorus; even then, he’s grim, as if reading his lyrics from a crystal ball: “Conceived, you born, you live, you die/My mama said don’t rush it, I can’t function with my pride.” He’s right—it isn’t pride that lines his voice, but reverent longing, stripping the walls of his past selves then studying the debris.Memoirs in Armour draws from a deep bullpen of guest producers, including the soulful Budgie (“Take Heed”), who worked extensively on Ways of Knowing, and Chuck Strangers (“Boulder”), who shares Navy’s meditative East Coast stomping grounds. For all the prowess they pack on their own, it’s compelling to see them take a backseat, parting the Red Sea for the rugged prophet at center stage. It’s even more compelling to watch Navy navigate the dry earth. “Time Slips,” a jarring eulogy of his sullen past, opens with quite the candidate for Introspective Hip-Hop’s pledge of allegiance: “This is the first time somebody would ever say this on a rap song, but can you turn me down?” Somber as he may sound, his vision is as clear as ever. “Depression was the birth of Navy Blue,” he raps. “My message is to serve a greater you.” He’s talking to us, but he could just as well be talking to himself.Correction: A previous version of this review stated that Navy Blue left Def Jam. It has been updated to reflect that he was dropped from Def Jam.",Rap,7.8
110,"On his first album in 15 years, the trailblazer cedes the spotlight to a roster of spiritual disciples. There are flashes of magnetism, but the visionary rapper we know and love is mostly missing in action. The accepted narrative of Rakim’s solo career—the exacting auteur who couldn’t get out of his own way—makes him an easy scapegoat for his catalog’s shortcomings. Dr. Dre offered the Get Rich or Die Tryin’ beats, but Rakim wasn’t interested; Rakim fled Aftermath with his masters, opting to churn out soggy, unmelodic odes to his own resume. In hindsight, Don’t Sweat the Technique, his final full-length with Queens DJ and producer Eric B., serves as a bookend in more ways than one. The duo dissolved months after its 1992 release, a moment when hip-hop swelled from an underground movement into a global, commercial force. Rakim laid the groundwork, and never quite cashed in.G.O.D.’S NETWORK (REB7RTH) doesn’t upend that version of the story, but it suggests a few complicating factors. Rakim’s spotty solo run (three albums in 32 years, for those keeping score) is blighted by lumbering dirges credited to no-name producers; G.O.D.’S NETWORK countervails the latter pitfall, at least in theory. Rakim produces everything himself, a quixotic endeavor exposing nearsightedness and structural defects—the metronomic drums are too loud for the mix. It might’ve been a torch-passing exercise, but most of the featured guests are 20 years past their primes. Rakim aims for moguldom, but lands closer to mixtape DJ.Rakim shoulders the hooks, but only raps three verses across seven tracks, meaning he’s MIA for large swaths of his own album. Still, the posse cuts are pretty good. “Now Is the Time” signals distinctive taste: The transcontinental lineup of B.G., Hus KingPin, and Compton Menace suggests Rakim and his assembly-line A&R are plugged into regional scenes and attuned to stylistic contrasts. What “Love Is the Message” lacks in novelty, it makes up in the magnetism of its contributors. Fresno veteran Planet Asia’s grizzled plea gives way to a double-time showcase from L.A. rapper Louis King; Rakim exhumes an old Nipsey Hussle verse for good measure.This tape should prompt inquiry into Rakim’s lost decades—he is, after all, an architect of the modern rap album. If he wished to transition into an executive-producer role, mentoring protégés in his image, what stopped him? Somehow, G.O.D.’S NETWORK lays blame at his doorstep. The tempos are plodding and the samples familiar: It’s literate punchline rap for and by middle-aged men, with all that entails. La the Darkman goes full anti-vax on “Pendulum Swing,” seemingly unaware that Fred the Godson, dead of COVID at 35, appears one track prior. “Sign of Se7en” features Sacramento rapper X-Raided, an actual convicted murderer. The curation is prone to hagiography—DMX and Prodigy appear from beyond the grave, along with a voice note from Snoop Dogg that may as well have been purchased via Cameo—without gesturing toward any future.Projects like this, aimed at a built-in audience of true-school crusaders, tend to be received in hushed, appreciative tones: Rakim’s reputation is hardly at stake. What’s curious is that Rakim can’t find anyone to produce or release his music. It’s no secret that hip-hop, as a genre, fails to look after its elders, and the flipside of the equation is that legends have bills to pay. Common just got an album’s worth of vibrant Pete Rock beats; Buckwild and DJ Muggs are Rakim’s age, and more prolific than ever. G.O.D.’S NETWORK positions Rakim as a passable producer instead of an elite MC, but he did it his way.",Rap,5.9
111,"The English and French musician makes crystalline electro-pop songs about mistakes, heartbreaks, and relationships that never got far enough to be either. Oxford and Lyon musician Julia-Sophie makes music about the temptation to relive your past: the more regrets that remain, the stronger the gravitational pull. Julia-Sophie dates several of her own regrets back to Little Fish, a short-lived garage frock’n’roll duo she led at the turn of the 2010s. Little Fish toured with Hole, Blondie, and Juliette Lewis (2010 was a time)—names splashy enough that, over a decade later, interviewers still ask about her stint in the band, thirsty for anything that might resemble Courtney Love goss. There are stories—a book-length mythology of this band exists, called Fuck the Radio, We’ve Got Apple Juice—but years later, Julie-Sophie remembered her time as a twentysomething industry scrapper not with rock bravado or “happy to be here” tact, but as a life that “broke [her], both as an artist and a human.”Julia-Sophie spent the intervening years learning to unbreak herself—and to reconstruct her music. Little Fish sounded about what you’d expect from triangulating Hole, Blondie, and Juliette Lewis: solid, in a kitschy sort of way. Julia-Sophie’s next project, pop-adjacent collective Candy Says, similarly sounded about what you’d expect from a band that recorded a dark electro cover of “Running Up That Hill” for a Netflix movie. Then she went mostly solo, working with a collaborator credited only as “B,” and her music got stranger. Julia-Sophie and B share an affinity with downtempo artists like Four Tet and Nicolás Jaar for heady sounds and studio work engineered like a puzzle box. Percussion sounds like nervous flutters; arrangements sound like the claustrophobic interiors of bathyspheres.“I feel like it’s been pretty intense listening to Julia-Sophie so far,” Julia-Sophie told The Quietus in 2021. Basic themes can be extrapolated from the titles of her past EPs, y?, but the levity doesn’t extend past these cutesy winks at heartbreak and existential questioning. She hinted that the follow-up record might be “warmer”; that didn’t happen. forgive too slow is as grueling a listen, and as good an introduction, as either EP: songs, crystalline like teardrops, about mistakes, heartbreaks, and relationships that never got far enough to be either.On paper, this doesn’t sound much different from the tastefully emotive pop that can be heard every week on BBC Radio 6. (Her singles have also been playlisted there.) But Julia-Sophie’s confessionals actually confess things. “Numb” makes a statement with a Depeche Mode synth-throb that goes past “chilly” to “unforgiving” and an equally self-lacerating monologue: “Instead of loving you back, I cheated and I lied, I lost myself in drugs and I lost myself inside.” The track derives its power not from raw emotion but from the dispassionate tone of a disaster surveyor itemizing wreckage. Preceding this is “Lose My Mind,” an electro track with an arrangement that sounds like it’s periodically overclocking and a mood heightened to the point of horror. Preceding that is “I Was Only”: a withering melody, a repeated shuddering chord, and a cocoon-like arrangement tuned for maximum 3 a.m. languishing.",Electronic,7.2
112,"Five albums in, Cults sound just as eerie and cheery as ever but struggle to transcend the fleeting pleasantries of paint-by-numbers pop. Joe Meek had an ear for greatness and a brain hellbent on destroying it. Often considered the British counterpart to American pop production legend Phil Spector, he composed most of his biggest hits holed up in a three-floor Islington flat above a leather goods store. He was fascinated with early electronic music and esoteric necromancy in equal measure; he famously dismissed the talents of a young Rod Stewart and called the Beatles “rubbish.” When he had enough of his landlady’s pestering about the ruckus he was making upstairs, he turned a shotgun on her, then himself. After his death, archivists found thousands of recordings he deemed unsuitable for public release, including songs he created for David Bowie. In his quest to create a sound bigger than himself, Meek sabotaged his success in the name of his own exacting standards.When Brian Oblivion and Madeline Follin first formed Cults over a decade ago, the two bonded over a shared interest in Meek’s musicality and madness, the way the first begot the second. Since their 2011 debut, the New York City duo has channeled that influence into girl group gems with a sinister underbelly, writing songs about haunted houses that went down easy thanks to Oblivion’s twinkling piano and Follin’s helium-high vocal harmonies. On their latest album, To the Ghosts, Cults lean into the bleak beauty of Meek’s story, attempting to channel the darkness in his DayGlo melodies. Five albums in, Cults sound just as eerie and cheery as ever but struggle to transcend the fleeting pleasantries of paint-by-numbers pop.Lest we forget their influences, the album opens with an echoing bell reminiscent of Spector’s biggest hits with the Ronettes. That song, “Crybaby,” does little to advance the band’s sound: From rhymes about an immature lover so facile they approach parody to synth melodies that feel recycled from previous albums, it sets the predictable tone of the record. When their songwriting does venture to new territory, it usually runs into an awkward metaphor, as when Follin waxes poetic about apoptosis on “Cells” or contemplates why onions make her cry on “Onions” (it’s the sulfur).The repetitive palette highlights why Spector’s groups transcended the march of time while Cults sound dated on arrival: Follin’s voice simply doesn’t carry the texture or technique of singers like the Shangri-Las’ Mary Weiss or the Crystals’ Dolores “Dee Dee” Kenniebrew. Across the album’s 13 songs, her voice strains against the band’s layered production (helmed by Follin and Oblivion, along with producer Shane Stoneback), fighting a losing battle against a particularly dense guitar riff on “Leave Home” and rushing to keep up with the propulsive electronics of “Behave.” Layered vocal harmonies prevent her voice from falling into the background completely, but her parts often feel like an afterthought.To the Ghosts is most promising when Cults veer from their girl group inspirations and experiment with dissonance on songs like “Eat It Cold,” with its descending minor scales, fluttering synths, low kick drums, and twisting vocal inflections. Ironically, the band constructs the most engaging potential future on a song that speaks literally of retreading one’s past. As a guitar plucks out a winding melody in its final third, the band recalls the spellbinding sounds that made Joe Meek’s productions so instantly memorable. But with too few new ideas, Cults risk simply embellishing on the well-trodden melodies of their inspirations, too consumed by creating an immortal pop song to let it live in the moment.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

113,"The underground rap vet caps a prolific mixtape run with a full-length DJ Muggs collaboration that’s loaded with the life experience to go with beats that bring to mind late-’90s Queens. The thing about road trips is that I remember a lot more about the aux cord arguments and hot take debates along the way than I do snapping photos of the Grand Canyon. Admittedly, my biggest flaw as a rap fan is not taking that lesson to heart: I’m so caught up in what’s next that I forget that getting there is the best part. One rapper I wish I’d paid closer attention to is Raz Fresco, who got his start as a Brampton teenager in the early 2010s with a laid-back swag that resembled Wiz Khalifa if he were in the A$AP Mob. Eventually, he fell into the orbit of Atlanta’s DJ Holiday, and then Philly’s Don Cannon, releasing a string of solid, versatile mixtapes full of streetwise smoker’s anthems.Somewhere in the middle of the decade, Raz Fresco fell off my radar. In that time he got deeper into his studies of the Five-Percent Nation, went to jail, had a near-death experience, and kept tinkering with his music. I wasn’t drawn back in until the pandemic, in the midst of his mixtape series Magneto Was Right, titled after an X-Men comic book fan theory that holds that the antihero Magneto’s idea for a violent revolution to free the mutants was more rational than Professor X’s philosophy of peace. In a little more than a year, Raz Fresco put out nine of these tapes, finding a real groove in the process. It wasn’t radically different from the music he’d released as a teenager, but it was headier and loaded with the life experience to go with beats that brought to mind late-’90s Queens. (I’d now place his music somewhere between the hard-nosed nostalgia of Griselda and the new age flyness of Mutant Academy.) He’s been prolific ever since, leading up to The Eternal Now, a satisfying joint project with reliable production OG DJ Muggs.Over 15 slow-mo tracks, Raz Fresco uses his buttery flow to weave together hard-earned life lessons, five-percenter lingo, comic book references, and a sense of disillusionment with the commercialization of hip-hop. On “Smoke & Mirrors,” backdropped by Muggs at his dreamiest, Raz name-drops the creator of Spawn, calls someone a “pussy” and “a slave to the charts,” and reflects on his artistic morals: “You can’t get your soul back or reverse the hour hand/This is how it lasts.” Less thoughtful writing sometimes undercuts his message, veering into cliché with the repetition of “Who own the dollar own the country” on “Bloody Money” or repeating tired hip-hop talking points on “Fake Beef”: “Used to paint the walls, now it’s they fingernails.” Save those out-of-touch gripes for the old heads with a YouTube channel.",Rap,7.1
114,"The South London experimental musician shifts from her usual leftfield electronics and avant-garde R&B to an album of blistering guitar noise. She has a few more tricks up her sleeve, too. More than once, the shapeshifting experimental musician Klein has joked with interviewers that her next move will be toward the mainstream—a hip-hop album, a drill album, signing to Roc Nation, moving to L.A. to become an Oscar-winning actress. And every time, she’ll return with a record that sounds like a church organ gaining sentience in a Category 3 hurricane, or something just as dubiously marketable. It’s a revealing setup, though, because the South London artist has consistently positioned herself as an outsider to the walled-off world of the avant-garde, more schooled in Hot 97 hits than the underground artists—Dean Blunt, Mica Levi—to whom she was initially compared.Eight albums into Klein’s discography, that claim gets harder to back up. She’s performed at London’s Barbican and ICA, adapted her own stage musical into a film, and has Björk’s number saved in her contacts. And yet, as her brilliantly weird live performances attest, Klein still defies categorization. On marked she doubles down, restricting herself almost entirely to a palette of blistering guitar squall that you’d more likely associate with the anti-rock extremism of Wolf Eyes and Aaron Dilloway. Technically, she’s explored this sound before. “top shotta,” from 2022’s Cave in the Wind, could be a lost bootleg of an Einstürzende Neubauten soundcheck; “grit,” from 2020’s Frozen, sounds like a far-off cement mixer munching down on a Telecaster. But on marked, almost every minute is claimed by Klein’s guitar, distorted to oblivion and shuddering with feedback.Overdriven riffs burn holes in the VU meter on “gully creepa,” opening a portal to a nightmarish loop that’s half dub soundsystem, half doom metal. Muddy drones are juxtaposed against trebly scrapings and blown-out drum machines on “Blow the Whistle”—a leap into heavy new territory for Klein, but one that will feel familiar to fans of JK Flesh and Dreamcrusher. It’s tempting to interpret the mood as one of anguished introspection. On “more than like” she goes swimming in an inky pool of piano, sinking into the sustained low notes, despondent. That’s followed by the extended circular drones of “enemy of the state,” where serrated chords are slowly mulched into one enormous slug of noise, à la Glenn Branca’s guitar orchestra.Klein’s signature flamboyant vocal runs are largely absent from the album; ditto the patched-in supporting voices that often populate her dreamy narratives. Exceptions come near the end on three a cappella fragments: the voice-note R&B of “frontin,” an off-the-cuff mini-duet with La Timpa titled “neek,” and the closing “exclusive.” Flipping the script on the entire album, “exclusive” is pure, unmistakable Klein—hyper-melismatic vocals, a pitch-shifted loop over ticking trap drums, a snotty rap (repurposed from “black famous,” on last year’s touched by an angel): “I just look around and what do I see/Another mini me,” she spits through crackling Auto-Tune, “Sweet girl big dreams/They call her fleabag.” The contrast with the previous 45 minutes is like pressing a bag of frozen peas against a bruise.",Experimental,7.1
115,"The Austin quintet’s debut fuses grimy post-punk, agit-jazz, and warped disco into a unique, oblique, and cheeky sound of their own. Thom Waddill, frontman of Austin rock quintet Font, summons his lyrics in semi-conscious fits of instinct. Dream recall and automatic writing; scrawled poems and nonsensical muttering. Waddill seems to live among towers of haphazardly stacked pages—Cormac McCarthy essays and dog-eared Dostoevskys—clipping from them like a scissor-happy kid. The angular, polyrhythmic outbursts from his bandmates are just as reflexive, often built from the drums up during improvisatory practice sessions. On their debut album, Strange Burden, Font fuse grimy post-punk guitar, combustive percussion, and blazing synth riffs, committing roughly three years of evolving live sets to tape. They lose nothing in the process. Strange Burden is meticulous and crackling—a concise, gripping record that sparks and sizzles like a kinked spike of lightning.Font is populated by multi-taskers; most members dart between strings, synthesizer, or a sampling pad at any given moment. During gigs, bassist Roman Parnell and guitarist Anthony Laurence swap machinery with Waddill at the front of the stage, while Font’s two drummers, Jack Owens and Logan Wagner, dish out dueling rhythms in the back. Wagner stands while performing, and of course, also plays a sampler. This kind of dexterity only aids Font’s teeming arrangements, which dissect and reanimate a pile of hyphenated genres. But trying to identify Font’s music is a slippery business; post-punk, art-rock, dance-punk, noise-pop…they are all accurate but insufficient descriptors.Font have been pretty up front about their influences: Talking Heads, LCD Soundsystem, and Radiohead have all been name-checked. But they are also channeling the warped disco of Ian Dury and the Blockheads, James Chance’s agit-jazz, and prog fuckery à la Squid and Black Midi. Font’s earliest singles are stirring and pushy. “Sentence I” is a twisted punk sermon spurred by Parnell’s elastic bass licks and Wagner’s thwacked cowbell. On “It,” Waddill contorts his voice between breathy yelps and ragged shouts, as Laurence’s guitar screeches like a circular saw gnawing through steel. The song is an early instance of Waddill’s absurdist humor:It comes through the bodyIt opens the doorIt crawls up my leg while my mom’s at the storeIt insults my dadIt calls out for GodIt suns on the deck with abandonThis faceless “It” is at first menacing, suggesting some kind of hostile, inhuman species. But the sudden swerve into a grocery store, and then a porch chair where “It” tans “with abandon,” feel like cockeyed portraits of the mundane. Most of Font’s songs modulate tension in this way, and Waddill is keen to conjure hyper-specific, mismatched visuals—as if he’s playing a solo round of Exquisite Corpse.",Rock,7.8
116,"Banjo player Nathan Bowles, double bassist Casey Toll, and drummer Rex McMurray reunite for a spacious jam session informed by Appalachian folk and modern minimalism. What constitutes a jam band? Do you need guitar solos that last the length of an Adult Swim show? Do you need concert attendees huffing balloons and taking LSD? Do you need to hire a lighting designer so sick that Justin Bieber steals him? Not to sound like the old hippie approaching hour five of the campfire lecture, but it’s all about the groove, man. The Nathan Bowles Trio’s Are Possible renders these questions moot by stripping this music of all frills and signifiers. This is three people in a room, conversing through instrumental mastery.Bowles, who plays banjo, doesn’t need squawking solos or balloons or drugs or a light show. He doesn’t need vocals—hell, he doesn’t even need a guitarist, though sometimes the instrument adds a nice flavor. On Are Possible, Bowles reunites with double bassist Casey Toll and drummer Rex McMurry (of CAVE) for the first time since 2018’s Plainly Mistaken, and though the sound is more direct now, the message remains the same. Plainly Mistaken foregrounded experimentation, pushing further into free improvisation. Here, the group digs deeper into the core melodies from which the songs are built. Great jams need not be heady or flashy: These exercises are live-time encapsulations of the awe invoked when one idea perfectly informs the next.Despite the spontaneity that exists between Bowles and his bandmates, the trio relies on a few tricks to move its songs from one section to the next. Opener “Dappled” immediately sets Appalachian folk music in conversation with jazz and modern minimalism. The song’s groove is contoured by Toll’s dexterous bass. Throughout the album, Toll, who plays with Jake Xerxes Fussell and Mount Moriah, serves as a counterpoint to the music’s mesmerizing repetitions. He provides the rhythmic and melodic tension, as he does on “Dappled,” where he riffs off Bowles’ banjo progression and dips between the pockets of McMurry’s groove.This practice is best illustrated on the album’s emotional centerpiece, “Gimme My Shit,” which stands out thanks to the joyous nature of the hook. A bouncing banjo riff contrasts with the comforting warmth of snare drum clicks; rhythmic chords occasionally give way to a shining melody, like sun slowly emerging from clouds. As the song marches along in 6/8 time, Toll provides the steady anchor, allowing Bowles to hint at the main refrain before finally landing on it. The eventual release is all the more powerful, as the duo engage in a descending phrase highlighted by a cymbal crash that creates the album’s most powerful musical motif.Banjo-led instrumentals that pay homage to Appalachian folk music is a hyper-specific niche, but Bowles and his band never allow their preferred sounds to hem in their experiments. This music leads in all directions, unfurling with patience and reserve to reveal the balance between repetition and deviation. Are Possible shows that rural folk, cosmic new age music, and hard-charging rock aren’t only relatable, but can be inextricably linked. The jam is only the beginning.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

117,"The Los Angeles quartet reinvents its sound on its sixth album, building on the cosmic post-rock improvisations first teased on 2022’s live Spiders in the Rain. The West, to quote the Lizard King, is the best. In the years since Jim Morrison committed that bit of boosterism to wax, the synecdoche between a few hundred miles of California coast and our whole hegemonic civilization has only become more darkly involved. Thankfully, this same ballyhooed complex of energy, spectacle, and violence offers a handy template for processing ongoing developments on its political, aesthetic, and psychic frontiers: aptly, the Western.Vertigo, Wand’s sixth studio album, is undoubtedly a Western—albeit in the contemporary style. Like the cinematic interpretations by Monte Hellman and Jim Jarmusch, it’s a meditation on inner frontiers, where borders constrict, identities shift, and maps go blank. Once upon a time, the Los Angeles quartet excelled at music fit for touring Mulholland Drive on research chemicals. Vertigo, by contrast, beats its vagabond retreat to the desert—to a Llano del Rio or Spahn Ranch of the mind. Its pleasures, consequently, are furtive and indirect, scattering like reptiles from an overturned stone.At the heart of Vertigo is not a narrative so much as fugitive guideposts through life’s fractured final cycle. From out of a haze of electric guitar texture, opener “Hangman” shuffles the mandala mid-tempo that will sustain much of the album. Frontman Cory Hanson’s voice is somber, shell-shocked; the tale a sketch without fixed subject or object. “Somebody’s trying to disappear/I guess I will find out/I’m gonna see you here tomorrow/I’m gonna be left out…” A dream before dying or the memory of a blackboard guessing game? The hangman carries out his sentence, but he also eases us on our way. In this sludgy fever’s subsidence, extended coda “Curtain Call” suggests a soul’s ascent, its destination still uncertain.Vertigo, too, emerges from a moment of uncertainty for the band. A four-year recording hiatus saw the departures of keyboardist Sofia Arreguin and founding bassist Lee Landey. Hanson, in the meantime, notched two formidable solo albums (recorded with help from Wand guitarist Robbie Cody and new bassist Evan Backer) whose energetic blend of folk, power pop, and progressive rock threatened intermittently to eclipse the main event. Ever resilient, Wand have conscientiously retooled their sound, crafting songs that seem excavated instead from the kind of cosmic post-rock improvisations first teased on 2022’s live album Spiders in the Rain. The result is a second debut of sorts, an act of self-definition in negative, at once a settling in and a shearing away.Gone is their past material’s giddy, lysergic bounce; instead, drummer Evan Burrows pours a spacious, continual foundation where melodies rise through repetition, and rich details (with string and wind arrangements courtesy of Backer) slither and swim. The members of Wand would probably be first to acknowledge that this is ambitious stuff—something akin to the tabula rasa of Pygmalion or Spirit of Eden, a whole of metamorphic parts—and thus not without pitfalls. The glistening, incantatory back half of “JJ” must still overcome a somewhat muddled takeoff. Elsewhere, atmospheres can linger indistinctly; at length, you come to miss Hanson’s mischievous persona and the old band’s monster-movie licks.",Rock,7.3
118,"The Kenyan artist’s new release is a stunning portrait of the electromagnetic sounds and hidden noises of his hometown. In its swelling electrical currents lies a thesis about the richness and drama of everyday sounds. Every city has its own sound—literally. Beyond whatever music might get played there, every place on earth emits a set of frequencies that is completely unique. For Joseph Kamaru, these identities are as distinct as skylines. “Soundscapes reveal a lot about how people think and behave,” he Resident Advisor. He notices them when he goes somewhere new and explores them in his music. Often, they make him think of his home city, Nairobi.Kamaru moved to Berlin in 2020. Since then, he’s recorded over a dozen records that position him as a master of esoteric sound: a blend of ambient, drone, noise, and field recordings, defined by tactile sound design and an emotional palette that runs from haunting to serene. In 2022, he composed what would become As Nature, a live show inspired, as he put it in an email, by “the electromagnetic sounds and hidden noises in Nairobi that are so present that the inhabitants of the city become connected with them.” He played it again and again at experimental events across Europe, tweaking it until he formed an intense bond with the music. “I became it,” he says.Natur, which arrives on the UK label Touch, is the album version of that performance. In its attempt to capture ineffable qualities of his home city, it is also a personal record. It is, like much of Kamaru’s music, subtly political as well, shifting the focus to an East African city in an art form dominated by Western bias. More than anything, though, it shows his unique way of hearing the world around him in extraordinary detail, and shaping those impressions into a surreal musical work.A single, 52-minute piece, Natur bobs and weaves through crackling noise and balmy ambience. For Kamaru, the sound of Nairobi at night is all about electricity, from the hiss of open transformers to electrosmog—sounds inaudible to the naked ear but captured by Kamaru’s electromagnetic microphones—all set against a darkness deep enough to be broken by low-lit iPhone screens. In its calmer sections, Natur serves up whispers, birdsong, footfalls and muffled crowds, humid drones and barely-there melodic loops. In its more chaotic sections, frequencies wail, whoosh, and crash. Above all, they buzz. At times the album feels like a gallery of the countless distinct forms electrical buzzing can take.Ambient as much of it is, the result is the opposite of background music. Natur is a voltaic odyssey, a ghost train rumbling, twisting and floating through this aural rendering of Nairobi at night. Kamaru has written about what he calls “activated listening,” a closely intentional form of listening that Natur demands of its listeners from its opening section, a swelling wave of electrical currents that crests just before it short-circuits. Perhaps because it took shape as a live performance, this is a dynamic, ever-evolving composition, one that moves through a sequence of scenes as distinct as they are abstract.",Electronic,8.0
119,"Tucker Pillsbury’s second album turns to folksy sincerity, recounting a celebrity breakup in songs that feel competent, cutesy, and almost believable. Tucker Pillsbury sure looks like a pop star. He’s got the movie-star good looks, a collection of trendy tattoos, and an eccentric Fashion Week wardrobe. The 27-year-old Maine native nearly landed a role in HBO’s Euphoria but was passed up for Dominic Fike, another suave, tattooed singer. Like Fike, Pillsbury has struggled to channel his on-camera charisma into compelling music. Since 2017, he’s released room-temperature pop as Role Model, portraying himself as a sweet-natured yet mentally tortured heartbreaker. He’s clearly inspired by alt-pop heroes Frank Ocean and BROCKHAMPTON, but his music mostly resembles Shawn Mendes if Mendes were a mediocre singer. “I want something on the radio,” Pillsbury told GQ in 2022. Shuffle through his catalog and you’ll hear an artist desperately searching for a star-making moment.Pillsbury’s second album, Kansas Anymore, is a step in the right direction. It’s a compact, confident, and well-produced pop-rock record about breaking up with one of Gen Z’s most influential stars, Emma Chamberlain, who has served as Pillsbury’s muse two records in a row. Rx, his 2022 full-length debut, was a frictionless and frequently excruciating collection of lyrically bland, Imagine Dragons-indebted love songs. While Kansas Anymore has shortcomings—cutesy choruses, unadventurous melodies, middling vocal performances—its personality and songcraft are more mature and palatable than any of Pillsbury’s past work.Though it makes a few bids for radio singles, Kansas Anymore seems less concerned with landing a hit than it does building a sturdy home to hang out in. Pillsbury and executive producer Noah Conrad draw from a folk-pop playbook of Fleetwood Mac and Kacey Musgraves to pen a selection of sunny, sentimental songs. “Look at That Woman” is pleasantly arranged with bright acoustics, slide guitar, and grand piano, and Pillsbury maneuvers well within his vocal range, cruising through plainspoken verses before stretching into a faint falsetto hook. In slower moments, like on the beautifully raw “Slut Era Interlude” or the silky Lizzy McAlpine duet “So Far Gone,” he winds his way into genuinely moving melodies; when he croons “I don’t want you but I want you to spend the night,” it sounds like he really feels what he’s singing. It’s a first for Pillsbury: He elicits a sincere emotional reaction, and he’s not playacting.There is definitely some playacting on this record, though. Pillsbury’s stomp-clap pivot feels slightly forced considering the recent success of artists like Zach Bryan and Noah Kahan. (“The Dinner” is a full-on Kahan rip—or Mumford & Sons, blame whoever you want.) Still, the role of cowboy-hatted songwriter suits Pillsbury better than the swaggering bad boy character he sought to cultivate on Rx, where he sang “I’d die for my bitch” with the conviction of a boy-band backup. In this softer, more contemplative mode, he’s an occasionally deft writer: “If I was younger, I’d take a downer/Lay on the carpet, pills on the counter/If I was lonely, I’d call up Rachel/Be there in twenty, jeans at her ankles,” he sings on “Slipfast.” He’s still prone to a weak chorus—the punchline on “Superglue” is a wincer—but Kansas Anymore proves Pillsbury to be a sensitive and competent songwriter, even when the G-C-D-major chords and verse-chorus archetypes wear thin.Despite some biting moments, the album-wide breakup narrative also loses intrigue. Pillsbury admits to masochistically reveling in disillusion, embracing “the feeling of letting it all burn down.” But voyeurs looking to get a documentarian view into his and Chamberlain’s private lives—and the album’s marketing certainly alludes to this possibility—will be disappointed. For all Pillsbury’s claims that he’s a “scumbag,” he’s quick to a cliché, and even quicker to a cheery silver lining. He wants what’s right for her; he tried his best; maybe they’re still meant to be? Without show-stopping talent or anything that truly differentiates him from the gaggle of guys who hope to blow up like Zach Bryan, he remains stuck in pop star limbo. He looks the part, but the role may already be filled.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

120,"The Bronx rapper’s full-length debut leans into a hard-nosed drill sound and features some of her most dynamic and abrasive bars to date. Ice Spice has described the year and a half between “Bully Freestyle” and “Munch” as taking “forever,” but things have moved a little faster since her breakout single: trending on TikTok, charting on Billboard, PinkPantheress collab, Nicki Minaj collab, Barbie placement, Taylor Swift collab, four Grammy nominations. All of this has happened on the back of startlingly little music—last year’s Like..? essentially tripled the size of Spice’s discography with its 11-song deluxe version—but those songs have generally pointed towards a smoother, more emotive strain of NYC hip-hop, equally influenced by the Bronx and Top 40. Whether barrelling through a soul drill beat in her On The Radar freestyle or swooping and floating in AutoTune over the sparsely whirring “be a lady,” Ice Spice has mixed boilerplate tough talk with tossed-off vulnerability, positioning herself as relatably aspirational (or aspirationally relatable).Where Ice Spice has so far been happy playing the wide-eyed protagonist of a raunchy teen movie, Y2K! suggests that perhaps she’s been waiting to get mean this whole time. Save for a pair of DayGlo singles, these diabolical tracks thump, roil, and seethe their way into testing the limits of your subwoofer. Gone are the coyly romantic maneuverings of “Boy’s a liar pt. 2” and “Gangsta Boo;” ditto the softened ambient grooves of “In Ha Mood” and “Actin a Smoochie.” Following in the footsteps of “Munch (Feelin’ U)” and “Deli,” the instrumentals on her debut album are abrasive and unapologetic, and Ice Spice attacks them with her most dynamic vocals to date: whispering and barking, shouting and sneering. Having earned her pop laurels, Ice Spice comes across as totally uninterested in convincing her unbelievers or even feeding her fans: She just wants to drill.Incredibly, Y2K! succeeds even though her much-maligned “lyricism” has only gotten worse. Ice Spice has always been able to sell groan-inducing punchline bars (“I’m standing on shit like a floor mat” or “He eat it up like Pac-Man”) through committed delivery, but her fixation on a new nickname pushes the limits. Scatological rhymes are pretty blase for hip-hop, but “I’m Miss Poopie but I never smelt” and “I’m Miss Poopie like I need a diaper” are the sort of claims that would get you laughed out of daycare. Spice has said that she wants her lyrics to be “super simple” and “digestible,” but that can veer into insipid repetition, whether on interminably chanted hooks (“Oh Shhh…”) or recycled rhyme schemes (“clappers” and “slappers” is a go-to). Three-quarters into the album, she throws off the clunker, “Bitches switchin’ but they wasn’t trans.”",Rap,7.6
121,"The Vermont indie-rock quartet’s debut album pits airy dreamscapes against raw realities, frolicking in the tumult of uncertainty. Tell a teenager that their 20s are for “living,” and they might envision flashy movie montages: rooftop parties, sloppy smooches, city lights whizzing by through back windows. Tell the same thing to that same person once they’ve actually reached the age, and they may sigh. Fleeting youth must fight fledgling adulthood at some point—just ask Robber Robber. Since co-founders Nina Cates and Zack James ditched Brattleboro for big-city Burlington, they’ve taken to pitting airy dreamscapes against raw realities, scoring the havoc with searing, expansive indie-rock stompers. On Wild Guess, the Vermont four-piece’s debut album, the carnage is supercharged: Rough-edged songs melt into soupy squalls, with alien truths nestled in heaps of amorphous noise. It’s hectic, bumpy, and full of treasures that reveal themselves over time. It sounds a lot like what growing up feels like.Robber Robber tread a thin line between hearty indie and rough-edged post-punk, melding the former’s airiness with the latter’s angst. Back in the 2010s, teenaged Cates and James played in a short-lived group called the Snaz, in which off-kilter garage rock buttressed precocious tales of teenage girlhood. Since their departure, the two have made notable additions to their sound—among them, guitarist Will Krulak and bassist Carney Hemler—though Wild Guess confirms they haven’t left any of their scrappy bite in those small-town rehearsal rooms. Perched somewhere above the havoc, Cates wanders through hypnotic epics with an aloof hush, like Trish Keenan testing microphones in the middle of a crowded Guitar Center. Perhaps the best example is “Seven Houses,” a torrential onslaught of downpicking, cymbal crashes, and bass fills that grumble like a starving Godzilla’s gut; for all its tension, there’s respite in her delivery, a wispy narrator frolicking in a bad dream. In the final minute of “Until,” a charming guitar ballad that bridges Crazy for You and Pod, Cates drawls, “Hold on,” until all that remains is a single sickly string obeying her directive to the bitter, distorted end. It’s one of several moments where you feel like you’re in the room with them.The longer you sit with Wild Guess, the more it might seem to exist in a funhouse, where time and space are freakishly malleable. While Cates deadpans from the corner, her bandmates rumble at the fore, churning out foreign grooves that tick like broken clocks. It’s a disorienting dichotomy, but a rewarding one, too—often, it feels as if the band is inviting you to eavesdrop, to peer behind the mic and pick apart the musical assembly line. This is particularly fun on a track like “Dial Tone,” where guitar and drums make spirited conversation while Hemler’s bass occasionally interjects, a shy friend raising a shaky finger. It sounds like dinnertime in a dysfunctional household—that is, until the overdrive clicks on, and all interlocutors are rasping in unison, holding it for a few fiery seconds before hushing as if nothing happened.",Rock,7.3
122,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit Daddy Yankee’s breakthrough album, the unforgettable year of “Gasolina,” and how the Puerto Rican rapper helped make reggaeton a global sensation. Maybe you were at a basement party, grinding with a pimply crush in low-rise flare jeans and a belly button ring you couldn’t stop staring at. Maybe, if you were a little older, you were driving around your city with too many friends in the backseat. Maybe, if you were in the Caribbean, you were at a party de marquesina learning what your hips and ass could do. Maybe you heard it at a middle school dance and felt compelled to engage in the ritual of a preteen dancefloor tryst. Maybe you bought it as a ringtone for your brand new hot pink Motorola RAZR flip phone.Maybe you were in East Harlem, or Humboldt Park, or Santurce, or a suburban strip mall town in middle America. No matter where you lived, there’s a strong chance that at some point between 2004 and 2005, you heard Daddy Yankee announce his arrival in the U.S. mainstream with a crystal-clear introduction: “Who’s this? Da-ddy Yank-ee!”  “Gasolina” was ubiquitous back then: That shouted hook, revving engine, and indelible, blistering pre-chorus blasted from every boombox, every passing car window, and every iPod Mini.“Gasolina” was the dawn of an empire. Barrio Fino, the album it appeared on, was the first reggaeton LP to debut at No. 1 on Billboard’s Top Latin Albums chart, spending 24 weeks in the top spot. In 2005, it won a Latin Grammy for Best Urban Music Album. Within a year of the record’s release, Daddy Yankee had landed a $20 million record deal with Interscope, a sneaker collab with Reebok, a Pepsi sponsorship, and a controversial modeling gig with Sean Jean. If reggaeton was going to go global, Yankee was going to squeeze every cent he could out of it. After all, the man got an associate’s degree in accounting so he wouldn’t be cheated “out of money.”This is the enduring image of Daddy Yankee: genre pioneer, business tycoon, reggaeton king. On Barrio Fino, Yankee presents himself as the commander of a movement that was poised to assume market dominance. But beyond its commercial impact, which is just one benchmark of its influence, Barrio Fino is also a document of a genre in a moment of transformation. This is an album that carries the knotty histories of reggaeton within it—from its origins as a form of protest poetry, to its transition into a moneymaking global force, to its role in affirming the imagined identity of Latinidad.Daddy Yankee, born Ramón Ayala, said he imagined Barrio Fino in part as an antidote to reductive portrayals of life in the projects. “The news you see everywhere is always marginalizing [the barrio], or blaming it for things that aren’t its fault,” he said in a 2005 interview. The barrio in question was Villa Kennedy, the caserío, or public housing project, where Yankee cut his teeth freestyling at 13 years old. At 16, he started recording his own mixtapes, hawking bootleg cassettes for $5. In the early ’90s, reggaeton hadn’t quite consolidated into the genre we know it as today; one of its precursors was known as underground, and Yankee was one of its preeminent practitioners. The Puerto Rican government used the music as a scapegoat for the proliferation of gangs, petty crime, and drug addiction. Then-Governor Pedro Rosselló implemented an anti-crime campaign that also targeted underground artists, leading to police raids of record stores that sold their cassettes in February 1995.",Rap,9.3
123,"Taken from a rousing 2023 reunion show, the UK stalwarts offer another souvenir double-live album filled with aged and elegant takes from the core of their songbook. Blur’s latest resurgence came crashing down at Coachella 2024, where the reunited quartet encountered an audience indifferent and ignorant to the very notion of Britpop. It was a far cry from the crowds Blur found at Wembley Stadium a half year earlier. Early in July 2023, just weeks prior to the release of their comeback album, The Ballad of Darren, Blur played a pair of shows at the iconic London venue, greeted by punters primed to revisit the glory days of Cool Britannia.The cavernous confines of Wembley may have been new territory for Blur but reunions are commonplace for the band. In the waning days of the 2000s, they mounted their first return, regrouping not much later to play a Hyde Park concert aligned with the closing ceremonies of the 2012 London Olympics. Both of these events were commemorated with the release of a souvenir double-live album, as is the 2023 show in the form of Live at Wembley Stadium, which is also accompanied by Blur: To The End, a feature-length documentary chronicling the band’s comeback. Available in a plethora of formats, Live at Wembley Stadium is best heard in its double-CD/triple LP incarnation which contains the entirety of the Sunday show, the second and final concert Blur played during its Wembley stint, a performance that carries a tangible sense of triumph: This is a band eager to commune with its devoted followers.Those listeners were ready to indulge in nostalgia, anxious to bellow “Parklife!” the moment Phil Daniels hit the stage to once again reprise his starring role from 1994. From a certain angle, that’s precisely what Blur delivered, devoting their set to the hits and album cuts that comprise their core songbook. No less than 16 of its 30 songs were also featured on Parklive, the album commemorating their 2012 performance, confirmation that the Blur canon is fairly entrenched. As commonplace as these tunes may be, the music feels considerably different than Parklive, a record that now plays like a jubilant relic of pre-Brexit Britain. Tempos are slower, particularly on such breakneck rockers as “Popscene” and “Advert,” there’s evident gravel in Damon Albarn’s voice, and Blur on the whole seems heavier, thanks in no small part to an added ballast in the rhythm section.Such subtle differences are part of aging; individual bodies change, as does collective chemistry. Blur certainly sounds older on Live at Wembley Stadium than they did on their previous live albums, yet those scars lend poignance to these familiar songs. The erosion in Albarn’s voice diminishes his impishness, adding a sense of empathy to his cultural observations. This is especially true in “Tracy Jacks” and “End of a Century,” songs written by a twentysomething wondering about “getting past 40” and how “the mind gets dirty as you get closer to 30,” now delivered with a wistful air by a singer on the far side of 50. Instrumentally, Blur accomplishes something similar. They still can play “Song 2” with burly credibility yet they seem mightier summoning cascades of psychedelic noise on “Trimm Trabb,” “Oily Water” and “This Is a Low” in versions that feel earthy and elegant.It helps that, unlike many modern live records, Live at Wembley Stadium actually feels alive. Albarn fumbles lyrics on “Beetlebum” and “Country House” and becomes overwhelmed with emotion singing “Under the Westway,” an elegy to London. Graham Coxon’s gnarly guitar runs ramshod over the vocals, while the bass of Alex James careens across the steady rhythms of Dave Rowntree. The quartet seems thrilled by the clamor they conjure and they’re able to channel that energy into the ballads, providing a nervy counterpoint to the middle-aged melancholia that underpins The Ballad of Darren. Where that studio affair offered a long meditation on maturation, the concert setting here prevents extended reflection; there’s a crowd to consider, after all. Blur nevertheless brings the bittersweet pulse to the forefront, particularly in the closing stretch that pairs recent single “The Narcissist” with “The Universal,” a song whose premonition of a numb, narcotized 21st Century has come to pass. That shift in the culture isn’t acknowledged outright but it’s felt, providing a wistful undercurrent on an album that’s a ripping entertainment.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

124,"The one-time EDM superstar’s production has never sounded shinier or sugarier, but beneath the maximalist synths and peppy rhythms lurk more complicated, bittersweet feelings. Porter Robinson thought he was ready to have fun. After the probing vulnerability of his 2021 album Nurture—wrung out after years spent trying to complicate the candy-painted sheen of his experiments with EDM—the North Carolina-raised musician set out to reconnect with the pleasure-seeking that informed his earliest work. His new album SMILE! :D is garishly nostalgic and unrepentantly joyous, full of maximalist synth leads that glimmer like a Blingee gif and tender-hearted vocal melodies that vibrate with the youthful abandon of songs overheard in suburban skate shops.On one level, it’s a cathartic release, a relieved exhale after a creative block that led to his last album. With a guest spot from the alt-pop pranksters in Frost Children and a torrent of silly stunts to promote the album’s singles, he signaled his goofy intentions. (At a pop-up event for “Kitsune Maison Freestyle,” he vibe-checked each fan that showed up and gave away clothing from his own closet.) But what’s actually in the songs is more complicated and emotionally raw than his reckless abandon implies.For the first time, Robinson reveals more of his sense of humor—“Bitch, I’m Taylor Swift,” he deadpans in “Knock Yourself Out XD”—but underneath the vivid colors and silly jokes, he’s wrestling with heavier themes. “Cheerleader,” though built around a synth lead as sickeningly sweet as the dust at the end of a roll of Smarties, grapples with the dynamics of parasocial relationships between fans and artists. Appreciative but anxious, lighthearted yet lacerating, the track’s tone is a tightrope walk made all the more dizzying by the confectionary rush of its instrumentation, which recalls both the impossibly glossy emo pop of late-aughts Warped Tour staples like Metro Station and the post-hyperpop experiments of singer-songwriters like glaive and aldn.Throughout, Robinson reflects on getting older and becoming an almost-pop star and ever more public figure. Even when he wraps his thoughts in colorful, caffeinated trappings, they hit hard. On “Year of the Cup,” he sings of a desperate, self-lacerating urge to be liked: “I can’t go to sleep/’Cause my mind keeps ringing with times that I laid out everything wrong with me up on stage/It’s embarrassing.” “Easier to Love You” mulls the loneliness of aging, finding disappointment in the distance between the person you are and the person you thought you might become. All the while, he favors arrangements as bright as he’s ever programmed: Tempos remain high, and chiming guitars float skyward in the mix.The energy is never more striking than on “Russian Roulette,” a peppily bittersweet song that grapples with career exhaustion and suicidal ideation—and takes a tongue-in-cheek swipe at an infamous joke review from Pitchfork’s early years—before ending with one of the most cutting moments on the whole album. After an emo-fueled chorus—“I wanna live/I don’t wanna die”—leads to a bouncy trance outro, a primitive computer-generated voice lectures about dance-music cliches (“The kick drum and bass suggests the song is coming to a close—that’s the format we’re used to”) before scolding, “Don’t kill yourself, you idiot.” Amid such stark contrasts in tone, the sudden vulnerability is strangely affecting.The split between effervescent sound and downcast mood is jarring. Robinson has been smiling through the pain at least since the loopy yet apocalyptic “Sad Machine,” but something feels different on SMILE! :D, as though he were under less pressure to make sense of the grand, sweeping emotions. He’s willing to be chaotic and a little all over the place, and though that does occasionally result in moments that are hard to process, Robinson proves that he’s as adept at wringing moving moments out of pop tropes as he is conjuring alien worlds.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

125,"The debut from the UK pop singer is a proficient study of her influences but can’t help but feel like there’s a lack of personality to the songs. On 11 May 2021, a minor pop schism occurred. It was the first Brit awards in the pandemic, delayed a few months from the ceremony’s usual February date. That night, two young stars who made their names in lockdown had massive debuts: Olivia Rodrigo’s first-ever live performance, of “drivers license,” and the British pop songwriter Griff’s second ever, of the very Gotye-like “Black Hole.” Backstage, that year’s Global Icon winner Taylor Swift held court in her dressing room, inviting the two self-proclaimed Swifties to share chips and take goofy selfies.Not two months later, it emerged that Swift had been awarded 50% of the writing credit for Rodrigo’s song “deja vu,” which had a faintly similar bridge to her song “Cruel Summer,” leading to an obvious distancing between the two. Meanwhile Swift has continued to shout out Griff and invited her to support a recent Eras date in London, praising her from the stage as “so creative on every single level.” What’s curious about the continued support, given the apparent reason for the estrangement of Swift and Rodrigo, is how profoundly indebted Griff’s debut album, Vertigo, is to Swift’s sound.This year’s The Tortured Poets Department watered down the boom and sheen of Swift’s 2014 album 1989, which is further diluted by the eminently tasteful pop songs of Vertigo. The racing pulses never risk causing alarm. The bubbling synths would barely disturb the surface of any pond. The martial drums are more ceremonial than primed for battle. There’s a cavernous, momentous glow to the production that reminds me of how the 1989 portion of the Eras tour echoes around the stadium every night. The quieter songs, like “Into the Walls” and “Everlasting,” immediately evoke the tenderly plucked strings and twig-snap beats of Folklore and Evermore.Obviously none of that suggests that Griff should be held liable for taking inspiration from a formative songwriting hero (she’s said her earliest musical memory is getting an iPod loaded with Fearless and playing it on repeat) or that creativity should be litigated that way. It’s just one aspect of how oddly derivative this long-gestating debut is. Tilt it this way and you hear the formal liturgies of London Grammar (soppy ballad “Astronaut,” piano courtesy of Chris Martin); that and the long tail of the excitement over 2010s Scandi pop that never really anointed any proper pop stars (the desperate, cathartic splash of the appealing “Miss Me Too” has Robyn in its DNA). Here’s a little MUNA (the gently punchy and ecstatic “Anything”); here’s quite a lot of the 1975 (the snapping “Hiding Alone,” the surprisingly loose dance breaks of “Cycles”).",Pop,5.8
126,"Decked out in wind synths and fretless bass, the L.A. trio’s debut album lovingly invokes new age and ambient jazz at their most opulent. It’s a heartfelt argument that smoothness is not a crime. Los Angeles’ Nicky Benedek and Alex Talan may not live in the past, but you can bet they have summer houses there. Benedek—who in 2011 cited Zapp and Roger Troutman as influences, making him one of the most clued-in college juniors in the history of higher education—got his start making sleek, ’80s-inspired boogie that sounded like it had been swiped from the cassette deck of a vintage lowrider (another major influence: West Coast G-funk). When he graduated to a broader amalgam of R&B, new age, freestyle, and deep house, Benedek’s music remained steeped in analog warmth and tape hiss. Talan, aka Coolwater, has shown similar crate-digging instincts on his NTS show Cool World West, favoring artists like Joe Zawinul, Bill Laswell, Haruomi Hosono, and also Talan’s late father, a filmmaker and bedroom synth player. Coolwater’s eponymous 2020 debut EP sounds like a distillation of all those influences, a kind of L.A. jazz noir with a Blade Runner soul. In the new trio Total Blue, which includes their friend Anthony Calonico, they dim the lights and deliver an even more enchanting simulacrum of outernational jazz and big-budget new age.The three musicians previously worked together on Coolwater’s EP, which in retrospect looks like a trial run for Total Blue. Their debut album takes similar sounds and influences—fretless bass, muted trumpet, racks of outboard effects—and distills them into a dreamier, more ethereal fusion. “The Path” opens the record on an aquatic scene: A liquid electric bass melody glistens like oily water beneath the docks; a gentle marimba rhythm clinks like rigging against sailboat masts. It’s chromatically lush, a feast of augmented chords and burnished accidentals; halfway through, a keening wind-synthesizer melody carries the song to its logical smooth-jazz conclusion. “Corsair” picks up both the maritime metaphor and the retro sensibility: Everything, from the flanged guitar to the LinnDrum thwacks, seems designed to evoke a specific era and spirit of digitally abetted jazz production. Back in its heyday, this was an expensive sound to create; Total Blue pay tribute to those studio bills of yore with sumptuous chords and arrangements that sound like a million bucks.If you didn’t know the backstory, it would be easy to assume from the album’s glistening sheen that it was a reissue of an ’80s new-age relic. Even the evocative, globe-trotting titles sound like something from a Windham Hill or Private Music laserdisc: “Heart of the World,” “Chaparral,” “Jaguarundi.” It’s not just the sound design that feels opulent; so do the songs themselves, which stretch out with an almost extravagant sense of leisure, bass glissando and ersatz reeds mirroring each other in slow, sensuous motions. No matter how many times I’ve listened, every time the trio pivots to a particularly juicy chord, it feels like triple cherries coming up on the slot machine.",Electronic,8.0
127,"The Cleveland band puts thrills front and center on its second album, slotting monster riffs into gruesomely switchbacking arrangements. Fun isn’t necessarily one of death metal’s chief attributes, but it’s one of the defining characteristics of 200 Stab Wounds; you don’t name your songs “Skin Milk” and “Stifling Stew” if you don’t enjoy playing around in the grotesque. (They say that the title “Release the Stench” was inspired by a bandmember slipping off his shoes in the van.) The Cleveland quartet’s 2021 debut, Slave to the Scalpel, was an immediately accessible album of gritty riffs and sinewy grooves in a cartoonishly gruesome sleeve, and it established 200 Stab Wounds within a new wave of death-metal bands like Creeping Death, Necrot, Undeath, and fellow Ohioans Sanguisugabogg—bands that use hardcore’s relentless forward thrust to power traditional death metal in the vein of genre heroes Cannibal Corpse and Bolt Thrower. The music is dark, ugly, compact, and covered in grime. If Blood Incantation’s brainy sound explores the cosmos, and Tomb Mold’s visionary approach pushes aesthetic frontiers, then 200 Stab Wounds’ sinister, concentrated music plumbs the Zodiac Killer’s basement.Slave to the Scalpel was recorded before 200 Stab Wounds began playing live, and its songs occasionally suffered from not having been road tested; there’s a fine line between relentless and monotonous that not even the nastiest riff can overcome. In the years since, they’ve toured ceaselessly with death-metal legends like Obituary and Dying Fetus, and it’s clear that hearing songs like “Slowly We Rot” and “Born in Sodom” every night for weeks—and discovering how their own music fared before a skeptical crowd—helped 200 Stab Wounds figure out how to turn a great riff into a great song. On Manual Manic Procedures, they chop their sound to pieces and sew it back up into meticulously arranged music played with speed, precision, and obvious glee; they’re inflicting all those wounds as efficiently as possible, but you can sense them enjoying each and every thrust of the knife.Right from the start, it’s clear that Manual Manic Procedures has been built to keep a crowd on its toes and a pit in perpetual motion. After an intro that recalls both “South of Heaven” and “For Whom the Bell Tolls,” the rhythm of opener “Hands of Eternity” changes five or six times in the span of a minute, from head-banging piston-pumping to thrashy swing to ’90s jock metal and back again; later in the song, they shift from a gallop into D-beat into a nu-metal drag. It’s nothing new for a metal band to combine subgenres, but making such a show of presenting the menu at the beginning of the meal shows the band’s fresh intent: Here are all the ways your body can and will respond to this record.",Metal,7.6
128,"Layering disaffected vocals over glitchy beats, the duo’s second LP is a deadpan testament of the terminally online. It’s both mundane and disorienting, irritating and soothing. New York are masters of anhedonic pop. The drolly named duo—26-year-old Estonian performance artist Gretchen Lawrence and 24-year-old Senegalese-American visual artist and model Coumba Samba—ostensibly draw from club music and hip-hop, but you can’t imagine their second album, Rapstar*, giving anyone the energy to lift their feet from the ground. It’s remarkably dead-eyed music, characterized by Samba’s sardonic deadpan and chilly minimalist glitches that sound like the Sheffield experimental duo snd as covered by the girls from Gossip Girl. The most excitable that the two musicians sound on Rapstar*—which is not very excitable at all—is when they splice their voices together on the title track to deliver a terse, twisted assessment of modern life: “The government will fuck you/And claim you deserve it.”Where so much prototypical “Gen Z music” uses maximalism to capture a sense of overwhelmed disaffectedness—think Babyxsosa beginning a song by yelling and ending it as if she’s been distracted by her phone—New York take a different tack. Rapstar* is both mundane and disorienting, down to its format: On Bandcamp and streaming services, it’s been inexplicably split into two volumes, subtitled Side A and Side B, meaning that you’ll have to make a playlist of all the tracks to listen in one go, or otherwise fiddle with Spotify halfway through, as if you’re flipping a record. On “bronx,” Samba repeats the phrase “In the Bronx I walk” until it takes on the character of Sisyphean struggle; on “no bra,” New York–based performance artist No Bra mutters about “Making out with no dress” over a subliminal, mutant footwork beat and improvised piano, making for an unpleasant but resolute answer to the question, “What does a sex jam sound like for a generation that reportedly hates sex?” It is frequently irritating music, but if you’re someone who’s frequently irritated by the world around you—who, for example, wants to scream about the fact that there are two Blank Street Coffees within 100 feet of Tottenham Court Road station—it can feel kind of soothing, a representation of modernity that depicts life as neither distorted and maximalist nor gloomily dystopic, but somewhere in the middle.New York’s debut, 2022’s darkly funny No Sleep Till N.Y., leaned enough into electroclash and ’00s signifiers—skinny jeans, the aforementioned Gossip Girl lilt of Samba’s voice—that it could broadly be tied into a broader reappraisal of “indie sleaze” and blog house, an idea furthered by last year’s “night n day,” on which they flipped the hook of Ladytron’s “Seventeen” into something even creepier and more depressing than the original. Rapstar* still kind of sounds like “Shoes,” particularly on “kicks,” on which Samba recites lyrics about shoe addiction over an IDM hum, but it also feels less indebted to the past than previous New York music.",Pop,7.3
129,"The Stuttgart producer Michael Fiedler’s debut album under a new moniker distills ambient dub into a wispy, wraithlike form. Back in 1994, tasked with curating the fourth volume of Virgin’s ambient series, Kevin Richard Martin coined a new subgenre when he dubbed the compilation Isolationism. Less a hard-and-fast category than a general air of desolation that might crop up in any number of contexts—drone, post-rock, industrial, and more—isolationism cast a long shadow across subsequent decades of dark ambient. Yet Martin himself didn’t linger there. Though he has made many different types of music under many different aliases over the years, he became most closely identified with the industrial-strength dancehall that he records as the Bug. That range makes Michael Fiedler a natural fit for Martin’s Pressure label. Using aliases like Tokyo Tower and Jah Schulz, the Stuttgart producer has been turning out dub reggae for nearly two decades. But in 2020 Fiedler began putting out a series of drone-driven ambient albums under his own name, tapping into the claustrophobic dread that haunted the original Isolation comp. The two sides of his musical persona now come together on his debut album as Ghost Dubs, a distillation of ambient dub into a wispy, wraithlike form.Fiedler has been moving toward this sound for a while. On 2020’s Dub Over Science, he slowed his tempos and muffled his bass, luxuriating in the murk. But on Damaged, he takes that process to new extremes. This is dub compressed to the point of abstraction, everything extraneous stripped away. A uniform palette carries across the album: ultra-low sub-bass pressure, hi-hats sanded down to silvery streaks, an omnipresent crackling fizz. Monochrome chords slosh back and forth like water in a bucket; whatever they began as—guitar? keyboard?—now they’re just fleeting smudges smeared across the tape. The bass is remarkable—even at a relatively low volume, it seems to vibrate the walls, turning the room into a larger-than-life speaker cabinet. Yet Ghost Dubs’ sound is also remarkably refined, accentuating the contrast between crystalline details and a swollen low end that wants to devour everything in its path.This is by no means an original sound—but then, things associated with reggae rarely are. The most obvious antecedent is the music that Basic Channel’s Mark Ernestus and Moritz von Oswald made as Rhythm & Sound, shifting from the club vestiges of their Chain Reaction label—home to ethereal recordings from Porter Ricks, Vainqueur, Vladislav Delay, and Shinichi Atobe—to a more vaporous vision of ambient dub, which gradually abandoned the “techno” half of dub techno. There are also echoes of Deepchord Presents Echospace’s The Coldest Season, a canonical ambient dub album from 2007; Pole’s alternately lilting and lurching studies in throb and crackle; and Andy Stott albums like Passed Me By and We Stay Together, whose air of Sisyphean effort anticipates the trudging uphill gait of Ghost Dubs’ agonizingly slow-motion grooves. Where Ghost Dubs stands out is in the intensity of his productions. Lots of people have tried their hand at this tradition, but few have achieved the heaviness, or the strangeness, of Ghost Dubs’ best work.",Electronic,7.4
130,"Donald Glover’s final album under this moniker features eclectic and adventurous rap and R&B, but the big swings never really connect. When I was 14, I was introduced to Childish Gambino through his 2010 mixtapes I Am Just a Rapper and I Am Just a Rapper 2. This was when he was a sitcom star first and a rapper second, rapping with a glut of pop culture references, getting off punchline after punchline in a congested voice that made him sound like Urkel doing Da Drought 3. I liked them because they were satire, or maybe not, and maybe that was the point. If anything, the mixtapes were endearingly corny, nerdy, and goofy—he played with a rap character he was forming and hinted at the racial insecurities that would make 2011’s Camp a pop-rap disaster.All these years later, Childish Gambino is merely a side project of Donald Glover, who has worked tirelessly to shift the perception of himself from nerdy, goofy, and insecure Black artist to a cool, layered, and serious Black artist. I think of his 2018 New Yorker profile in which he said, “I learn fast—I figured out the algorithm,” and described his “superpower” as getting people to believe whatever he wanted them to about him if he tried hard enough.He did try and it worked. “Awaken, My Love!” from 2016 was essentially his Parliament-meets-Maxwell funk project. It’s nowhere near as soulful or groovy as he wanted it to be (I’ll give it up for “Riot,” though), but it did infuse his music with the stamp of Blackness he was thirsty for. Then there was the song and video for “This Is America,” more vague and less radical than its reputation, but it instantly gave his songs the aura of importance. And, oh yeah, there’s this television show he created called Atlanta, one of the best shows of the 21st century, the thing that makes good on his desire to make exceptional Black art. Through dark comedy and the hyperlocal lens of his hometown, the show blurs the lines between persona and reality, a thought he was veering toward on the 2013 project Because the Internet. And yet the greatest achievement of Atlanta is much more straightforward: It was funny as hell.There’s not much of a sense of humor on Bando Stone and the New World, billed as Donald Glover’s final album as Childish Gambino. The reason he gave The New York Times? “It’s not fulfilling. And I just felt like I didn’t need to build in this way anymore.” You can feel that in how he seems burdened with the pressure of living up to the perception he has molded for himself. It’s a strained album that so badly wants to end the Childish Gambino experiment with a bang, that wants to be a middle finger to everyone who ever thought he didn’t have the range to pull off whatever he set his sights on, that wants to be the kind of vulnerable record that lasts because a new generation of teenagers see themselves in his music. That’s fine and all. Atlanta had similar ambitions baked in. But also, the best episodes featured something you had never seen before in your life, and it was exciting to watch Donald and his writers’ room subvert the expectations of TV. Meanwhile, Bando Stone and the New World is a familiar slog, and the swings feel algorithmic rather than experimental.",Rap,5.8
131,"Congolese singer Makara Bianko and French producer Débruit craft polyglot techno-punk with a bustling, metropolitan atmosphere. The first sound on KOKOKO!’s Butu is the sound of bustling traffic. It takes about a minute for the outline of the opening song, “Butu Ezo Ya,” to emerge from the hubbub, as siren synths and shouts that could be mistaken for those of drivers and angry pedestrians reveal themselves as the sound of the band and their instruments. Maybe it’s second nature for a group formed in Kinshasa, the most populous French-speaking city in the world, but this ostensible party music suggests an almost Untrue-like level of metropolitan density. Stereogum’s Tom Breihan said that Usher’s “Yeah!” sounds like it’s playing in a club, no matter where you encounter it. I thought something similar while listening to Butu: This music could turn anyplace into a teeming street corner.KOKOKO! started out as an unconventional quartet making twitchy techno-punk with objects like typewriters and oil barrels—a workaround for the high cost of gear in Kinshasa. Now the duo of Congolese vocalist Makara Bianko and French producer Débruit, the band brings a polyglot perspective to a long lineage of paranoid electronic rock. Both collaborators come from the dance-music universe, yet Bianko’s sweaty shouts and Débruit’s tarnished production impart an unmistakable whiff of punk; fans of electro-punk upstarts Special Interest and Lip Critic will find plenty to love here.“Butu” is a word for “night” in Lingala, one of several languages used by Bianko on the record. Butu’s aesthetic is often associated with clubs and bars, and producer Débruit—a DJ since the late 2000s—flexes his house muscle here, setting Bianko’s voice against irregular snares and overdriven basslines. Sometimes Bianko sounds like a rapper, as when he slips into an impressive triplet flow on “Telema.” Other times he’s a shirtless hardcore shouter, an arch goth crooner, or a relentless human sample. Cloaked in an evocative swath of reverb, Bianko’s competing layers of shouts and ad-libs create the impression of a small posse rather than a single singer.The illusion of continuous chatter and conversation is compelling enough even if you don’t understand any of the languages spoken therein. The band performed in Devo-like hazmat suits early on, and like Devo, KOKOKO! like catchphrases that double as party chants and political statements: “Donne-Moi” (“Give Me”) can refer either to the give and take between a performer and the audience or the exploitation of the Congo’s musical and natural resources by foreign intervenors. “Move the world,” Bianko entreats listeners on “Mokili.” Maybe he’s talking about dancing, maybe political involvement—either way, the tumult of humanity KOKOKO! conjure on Butu sounds capable of shaking the planet off its axis.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

132,"The Hot Chip member’s third solo album proffers empathetic pop-house as the cure to what ails us. But in a divided world, politeness only goes so far. Feeling down? Weary? Out of sorts? Hot Chip’s Joe Goddard has got you covered on Harmonics, the London producer’s third solo album and a record so relentlessly empathetic it can feel like getting smothered by a pack of golden retrievers.Goddard has history here. Hot Chip, the group he co-founded with Alexis Taylor, are known for their arm-around-the-shoulder melodies, while his project the 2 Bears, with Raf Rundell, once released the charming “Bear Hug,” a song that literally promised to take you in its arms. Goddard’s 2011 single “Gabriel,” meanwhile, is such a beautifully rendered, deeply felt pop-house song that it almost managed to escape from the charred emotional void at the core of VULTURES 1’ “Beg Forgiveness,” where Ye flipped its chorus into a defense of Chris Brown, of all people.But Harmonics really is a festival of warmth, from its cordial name down. Goddard designed the record, he says, to be “loving, romantic - and fun,” and this approach extended into Harmonics’ production; Goddard tried not to force meaning onto the music or his collaborators. Certainly, it all sounds very welcoming: The beats largely bounce along at an inclusive 125-ish BPM as the music takes a soothing stroll through the dance styles that have long dominated Goddard’s work, namely house, garage (both UK and U.S.), funk, and soul. The synths shine persistently bright and a stream of guest vocalists pour their hearts out on songs that are heavy on tales of romantic intrigue.Still, Harmonics isn’t really a happy album—more a wistful one, with a deep strain of “chin up mate” encouragement. Goddard’s melodies tend toward the doleful, and an understated melancholy runs through Harmonics like late-summer nostalgia. Sure, there is romance, but we are far from the happily ever after. “Why do we love then in this world/Why must we try again, hurt ourselves,” Goddard ponders on “Follow You,” a vaguely gothic rock-soul number. The album’s guests don’t sound in much better humor: “Deep inside I know just what to do/But how do I find healing in the song?” Milan-based singer-songwriter Fiorious croons on the gospel house of “New World (Flow)”.This melancholy dance format produces some beautiful moments. “On My Mind” is the kind of ruminative 2-step that Jamie xx wishes he could achieve, while “Summon,” with former Wild Beast Hayden Thorpe, is a Larry Heard-esque fantasy of deep-house beats and disco introspection. At times, though, the relentless march of default mode boom-tish house and bittersweet synth melodies gets a little stifling—less comforting than simply comfort zone.What’s frustrating is that there is a more adventurous album trying to escape from beneath Harmonics’ house-y shroud, one where Goddard’s more intrepid collaborators really take the lead. “Miles Away,” with Guinean vocalist Falle Nioke, and “Progress,” with Ibibio Sound Machine, both touch on Afro-house; “When Love’s Out of Fashion,” with British rapper Oranje, detours into hip-hop; and “Revery,” with Alabaster DePlume, has a touch of Underground Resistance-style space jazz to its saxophone groove.That these are among the best songs on the record is no coincidence. Goddard’s compassionate attitude is a welcome antidote to our divided world, and it does often bear fruit. But little truly great art is made by committee. Harmonics’ collection of relatable songs and interesting ideas could use a stronger hand on the tiller to reach its intended destination.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

133,"The Berlin-based producer’s new album is a spellbinding fusion of atmosphere and texture, forever on the point of mutating into new shapes. For as long as he’s been putting out music, ZULI has stayed two steps ahead. The Egyptian producer switches up styles not just from record to record, but often from song to song. His debut EP encompassed noise-rap beats, lo-fi techno, Detroit-inspired futurism, and crickets chirping over bell tones. The leaps between releases are even greater: After the extreme abstraction of his moody 2018 LP Terminal, in which hip-hop and footwork were pulled apart at the seams, ZULI sank his teeth into a set of no-holds-barred breakbeat smashers on 2021’s ALL CAPS. A Cairo native, the artist born Ahmed El Ghazoly spent much of his childhood in London before returning to the Egyptian capital, a double displacement that he says gave him his sense of restlessness. “I think the move between countries instilled an urge to rebel against my surroundings,” he told an interviewer in 2021. He was talking about his preference for “niche” sounds over popular styles, but he’s just as reluctant to relax into a niche of his own making. Now, on Lambda—his first major release in six years—he changes course yet again, jettisoning the rhythmic force and focus of his previous records in favor of a spellbinding fusion of atmosphere and texture that spills over with nebulous emotion.Lambda opens like a sunrise over a ruined city, vast chords of cinematic scope and symphonic grandeur swelling and morphing. A lurching electro rhythm rises and fades, speeding and slowing before abruptly falling silent, but what really drives the action are the tiny vibrations rippling across the surface of the music, a riot of unpredictability. ZULI’s productions have always felt unstable, but they’ve never been more precarious than they are here. His chords are a swampy morass; his textures shudder like ground liquefying in an earthquake, minuscule particles suddenly gushing in streams and bursts.This palette—a thick slurry of buzzing synths and blown-out distortion—carries across the breadth of the album, lending a feeling of uniform intent that makes it the most cohesive release in his catalog. Despite the extremity of the sound design, Lambda frequently feels like ZULI’s attempt at pop. In “Trachea,” a heavily processed voice groans and gurgles over chords that gleam with the imposing majesty of Jean-Michel Jarre; in “Syzygy,” UK-born, Hamburg-based performer MICHAELBRAILEY’s shrill falsetto soars above a shapeshifting backdrop of synths and piano that’s reminiscent of Arca’s mutant assemblages. The majority of the album’s tracks feature some sort of singing, usually woven deep into the gelatinous mix. “Syzygy” kicks off an interconnected three-song suite in which voice and synths alike are ground to dust; in “Plateau,” a highlight, Abdullah Miniawy’s mournful incantations twist like smoke, twined with melancholy clarinet and a tremolo figure that delightfully, however accidentally, recalls the Smiths’ “How Soon Is Now.”",Electronic,7.9
134,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit Ashanti’s assured blockbuster debut, a lynchpin record for the new era of pop and R&B at the dawn of the century. By the early 2000s, every rapper, producer, and label with a weekly Billboard subscription had a new formula for a Top 40 hit: Get a rapper and a singer together to make a song for women. Murder, Inc. arguably had the slickest cheat code, pairing the label’s flagship artist Ja Rule’s surly love-laden raps with a sweet R&B voice like Christina Milian or a soulful gospel tone like Lil’ Mo. Around this time, a 19-year-old Ashanti met Murder, Inc.’s excitable co-founder, Irv Gotti, who, back then, didn’t want an upstart singer from suburban Glen Cove, Long Island, on his hardcore rap label. Instead, he enlisted her as an in-house songwriter and guest vocalist. Despite what Gotti told her in their initial meeting—that he wasn’t “an R&B dude”—he kinda was. His breadwinner, Ja, was a cosplaying 2Pac moonlighting as millennial rap’s Keith Sweat. His new secret weapon was an affable former high school track star who softened Ja’s aggressive balladeering.Ashanti spent her early Murder, Inc. days writing for her life at Crack House Studios in Manhattan’s SoHo, surrounded by dice-rolling men—the little sister among “a den of wolves,” as Gotti described. She was the sweetie in a room full of so-called gangsters. Her voice wasn’t all that soulful or acrobatic. It was featherweight and more coy than cool, never at risk of overshadowing a song’s lead, which made her the perfect companion for rappers aiming to create sticky street anthems.Millennial pop soon alternated between two distinct sounds: Ja Rule’s freaky outbursts and Ashanti’s gentle coos. She got her big break singing the hook on Big Pun’s posthumous 2001 single, “How We Roll.” From there, it was a full-on blitz. She sang background vocals on Ja’s monster Jennifer Lopez duet “I’m Real,” a summery jam built on a sample from Rick James’ 1978 weed ode “Mary Jane.” She backed Fat Joe’s crowing serenades on “What’s Luv.” Ja Rule plucked Ashanti again for his sophomore album’s second single, “Always on Time.” His semi-mushy, gaslight-ridden version of romance opens with Ashanti’s soft vocals setting up a toxic love story, complementing Ja’s bearish declarations about swinging dick and running on belated Jesus time. The song peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and set Murder Inc.’s low-key young hitmaker up for a smooth transition from utility player to solo star. The charts might’ve belonged to Ja, but he was no Ashanti.By the time Ashanti’s self-titled debut dropped in April 2002, she was already a household name. The combination of her breakthrough solo single, “Foolish,” hitting No. 1 for 10 weeks, and “What’s Luv” at No. 2 made her the first woman to simultaneously occupy the top two spots on the Billboard Hot 100. The pop landscape was eager for a voice as sleek as Aaliyah’s after her death, and Ashanti thrived in the mid-tempo zone. Sometimes, too mid. Shortly after her debut dropped, over 20,000 people signed an online petition against her winning Soul Train’s Lady of Soul Award, citing her lack of “singing ability and stage presence.” Her vocals weren’t striking enough to blow out stadiums, but with no major rivals in her path and Beyoncé’s solo debut still a year off, Ashanti sat comfortably on her perch as America’s sweetheart.",Pop,7.2
135,"With a sci-fi concept and a psychedelic sensibility, the NiNE8 Collective member brings a mix of funk, ska punk, grunge, dance, and indie that’s part London, part L.A. On Lava La Rue’s jangling new-wave jam “Push N Shuv,” the future collides with the past. La Rue’s vocal takes, recorded when the artist was 21, are a time capsule marking the exact moment they sowed the seeds that would become their debut album. The vocals intertwine with a piercing flute melody, which adds a dash of sci-fi surrealism to the otherwise retro funk groove. On STARFACE, the record that arrives five years after those vocals were recorded, La Rue continues to catalyze the old and the new. The result is a glistening mixture of psychedelic funk, ska punk, grunge, soul, and indie rock.La Rue—whose stage name is an anagram of their birth name, Ava Laurel (also spelled Aiwa Laurel)—was born in west London in 1998. Raised primarily by their Jamaican grandmother, they entered foster care in their teen years. Surrounded by the punk heritage of the West London estates they lived in, they started a DIY band of their own named the West Borns, which they’ve described as an aspiring “all-girl band version of the Clash.” Later, in school, they met fellow musicians Lloyd Macdonald and Jess Smyth—now known by stage names Mac Wetha and Biig Piig—with whom they formed the NiNE8 Collective. NiNE8 represent a radical proposition in a world of nepo babies: independent, working-class Gen Z artists who insist on splitting all profits equally between them, prioritizing community and collaboration above solo success. Alongside their work with the collective, La Rue has collaborated with artists including Clairo, Deb Never, and Vegyn on their own music—releasing a clutch of EPs blurring their indie, punk, and rap influences since 2017—as well as directing visuals for other artists, including Wet Leg.Lava heralded a hallucinogenic new era with their 2022 EP Hi-Fidelity, a mellow collection of breezy, trippy funk. On STARFACE, they lean further into that psychedelic sensibility, this time with bolder, braver melodies and a flair for the dramatic. The record hangs around a concept—an alien lands on Earth and learns about the destructive nature of human relationships (or as La Rue puts it, a “lesbian Ziggy Stardust”)—but following the narrative isn’t really necessary to enjoy the record’s plush, omnivorous sonic world. Written and recorded between London and L.A., the record has its feet on the rain-spattered concrete of La Rue’s childhood homes and its head in sunny California skies: Flecks of drum’n’bass and ska bump shoulders with soul, funk, and R&B.In keeping with La Rue’s collaborative spirit, STARFACE is full of features. Their NiNE8 peers take turns offering uneven but spirited verses on the bass-driven “Fluorescent Beyond Space”; Biig Piig’s feather-light delivery over a rush of Tame Impala-style synths makes a particularly dreamy impression. La Rue also looks outside the collective for creative input, conjuring a queer fantasy with K-indie star So Yoon on “INTERPLANETARY HOPPIN,” and romantically reimagining pirate-radio sounds with Malaysian-Irish artist Yunè Pinku on “Second Hand Sadness.” Meanwhile, on the muscular “Poison Cookie,” La Rue recruits New Jersey rapper Audrey Nuna for a rock anthem with real superhero fight montage energy.",Pop,6.9
136,"Self-funded, self-released, self-produced, and self-referential, the Welsh rock band’s seventh album has a big-tent sound with all the requisite wit and panache. It is unquestionably the ultimate Los Campesinos! album. How does one best measure the Los Campesinos! experience—in years or albums? Sexual humiliations or World Cup disappointments? Pints of lager or mouthfuls of vomit? Whichever you prefer, they’ve come a long way to reach a recognizable form of “maturity.” All Hell, the Welsh band’s seventh album, ends with a solo acoustic guitar, musings on the afterlife, and hushed backup vocals that make it kinda sound like a late-period Blur song. True to form, it’s also called “Adult Acne Stigmata.”If the embarrassments of adolescence have become badges of honor in adulthood, well…there’s probably a Los Campesinos! album to which you have an unhealthy attachment, so I won’t dishonor that by calling All Hell their best. But it is unquestionably the ultimate Los Campesinos! album. Self-referential, self-funded, self-managed, self-released, and self-produced, All Hell is a triumphant validation for the coalition Los Campesinos! have amassed in two decades of wandering the margins: emo-curious indie adults, indie-curious emo kids, DIY scenesters and Genius annotators, avid consumers of hard cider and hard-left politics, obsessives of European football and American Football alike.To call All Hell a form of fan service is hardly a slight, since that’s been the entire point of Los Campesinos! from their very beginning—from their early zines to the “Blood Pact” badge to the “Doomed” football jerseys to their listening party bingo cards or even just the socialist leanings inherent in their name. Throughout their new record, Gareth David pledges allegiance to Hunt sabs and ACABs, secular girls with Catholic guilt, backbreakers of the spineless, cheapskates with costly words. Conversely, the ever-present “them” in positions of authority are anonymous and off-screen, interested solely in protecting their power. “Tell me how many hours in any single dull day/Can I pray to a league table but still it don’t change?” he sneers on “Long Throes,” a perfect expression of the existential dread that comes after years believing that outcomes in politics, sports, or the supernatural could actually be changed by the average person.Maybe there’s a German word that captures this feeling, but until then, Gareth does his best with a series of truly one-of-one metaphors. As ever, the dizzying array of football, video game, and wrestling references illuminate rather than obscure the syllabus of “adult friendship…drinking for fun and drinking for misery…the heart as an organ and as a burden…climate apocalypse.” The grim jest of life is a “cavalcade through antemortem, terminal suburban boredom,” ground-level organizing is “pooling pennies for the coin-op guillotine”; lust is rendered as familiar greed (“You’re a million bucks and I am avarice”), whereas the climate apocalypse might come before finding true love (“You and me, antipodes/The Earth’s collapse, we finally meet”).",Rock,8.5
137,"The UK dance producer’s effervescent debut glows from within, powered by nostalgic ’80s synth and a stacked guest list that includes Rina Sawayama, piri, and Empress Of. Cars and pop music: They’re quite literally built to go together. Enter True Magic, the Ninja Tune debut from Manchester-based producer salute. Engines roar to life and cheers crescendo with each lap as producer Felix Nyajo shifts effortlessly across French touch, glitchy house, jungle beats, UK garage, and soul samples. Traversing genres with a pop sensibility alongside a heavy roster of collaborators, True Magic recalls Settle, the career-defining debut by Disclosure (who are featured on “lift off!”). salute and longtime friend and executive producer Karma Kid inject each track with LED-lit momentum and joyriding ease.salute’s first full-length has been a decade in the making. In 2014, Nyajo relocated from Vienna to the UK, immersing themselves in the British club scene at a moment when the robust, metallic rhythms of future bass pioneers like Hudson Mohawke and Rustie dominated. That tectonic purple sound influence—chip-tune buildups pieced together with sludgy bass hooks—was audible in early salute releases. Since then, Nyajo has ironed out the aggressive drops, smoothing their style into what they’ve called “fast and soulful house music.” They’ve performed for Boiler Room crowds and worked alongside modern-day pop hitmakers (the 1975’s George Daniel) and fellow rising producers (DJ Boring, DJ Seinfeld, Barry Can’t Swim). Four Tet is a fan.True Magic demonstrates the extent of salute’s evolution. Its songs are sculpted around glowing ’80s synthesizers, nodding to modern nostalgists like Daft Punk, Alan Braxe, and Kavinsky. The sleek, Weeknd-esque “Maybe it’s u,” featuring vocals from Scottish producer Sam Gellaitry, has the propulsive punch of Discovery and some of Ratatat’s cheese-grated guitar. Blending gritty bloghouse with elements of UKG, drum’n’bass, and jungle, salute emulates the aura of past hits without ripping them off. The results showcase their curatorial skill, fitting each track to their guests’ strengths. Empress Of’s satin vocals are the perfect vessel for romantic longing on “one of those nights”; piri’s cherubic tone in “luv stuck” is matched to bubblegum house on cruise control.Nyajo locates True Magic’s inspirations in vintage Japanese car advertisements, a colorful, frictionless style of clip that matched shiny new automobiles to sentimental pop soundtracks and fuzzy graphics. A sample of the Japanese jazz fusion group Casiopea’s song “Asayake” on the intro nods to a similar time period, but salute doesn’t linger: They swiftly transition to the rubbery bass of “saving flowers,” with Rina Sawayama. It’s as satisfying as running a series o f green lights. The front half of the album’s French house tilt is abruptly (and thrilling) interrupted by “go!,” featuring Japanese rapper Nakamura Minami, whose high-energy, hyper-animated style previously landed her work in the racing game Need for Speed.",Electronic,7.5
138,"The New York singer’s smoldering, sophisticated songs get a little more cosmic while retaining their characteristic wit and charm. In March 2022, Cassandra Jenkins was laid up with COVID at a Homewood Suites in Aurora, Illinois, Wayne’s World while her tour bus drove on without her. It was a terrible time to get sick. Not long before, the lifelong musician had been ready to give up music altogether—or at least jettison hopes of ever making a real career of it—when her second album, 2021’s An Overview on Phenomenal Nature, unexpectedly connected with fans and critics. Now, quarantined in her hotel room, her mind spinning with worst-case scenarios, she began writing a song to keep anxiety at bay. “You know I’m gonna keep at this thing if it kills me/And it kills me,” she sang, in an early version of what would eventually become “Aurora, IL,” one of the standouts from her new album, My Light, My Destroyer. Determination and its flip side, desperation, are nothing new in Jenkins’ work. (“Give yourself a few years… None of them like you, dear,” she sang wryly on her solo debut, Play Till You Win.) But here, they take on almost cosmic dimensions, providing the backdrop to some of her most revelatory—and carefully rendered—songwriting yet.“Desperation,” in fact, is the sixth word we hear on the whole record, in an opening line in which Jenkins tells us, in no uncertain terms, just how desperate she is. She recounts an existential search, nonspecific yet unmistakably real. As she reaches a climax in her quest, she sings, “And I felt my arms rise light as feathers,” her alto warmly reassuring over a sweet approximation of Van Dyke Parks-esque ’60s pop. But everything gossamer suddenly turns hard and brittle: “And the clock hit me like a hammer/And my eyes rolled back like porcelain/And the breeze cooled me like aspirin/And I cried.” You can practically feel each one of the objects she invokes beneath your fingertips.The album is peppered with similarly dazzling images and unexpected counterpoints. In the slippery heartland rock of “Aurora, IL,” her sickbed spell leads her gaze upward, to planes crisscrossing the sky, and then even higher, to a vision of William Shatner circling the planet, weightless in one of Jeff Bezos’ rockets. Shatner weeps upon re-entry. Juxtaposed against this, she spins humdrum worry (“How long can I stare at the ceiling/Before it kills me?” goes the line in the final version) into a meditation on the precarity of the human condition.She’s also just plain funny. Jenkins has always had a sneaky sense of humor—look no further than her fondness for unexplained Easter eggs. (After her debut album ended with “Halley,” a song about the comet, she slipped “Hailey,” a tribute to her friend Hailey Benton Gates, the actor/journalist/model, into the penultimate slot on An Overview on Phenomenal Nature; the new album closes with a lilting instrumental outro called “Hayley.”) On “Clams Casino,” a smoldering rave-up about loneliness inspired by her grandmother’s death, she contemplates leaving the hotel bar and driving out to the ocean, leading to an unexpected punchline. “I heard someone order the Clams Casino,” she sings. “I said, ‘Hey, what’s that?’ They said, ‘I dunno.’” It’s a joke so anticlimactic, you can almost imagine Stephen Wright intoning it in his trademark deadpan. Yet there’s tenderness here, too—the empathy of someone who knows what it feels like to be let down in a moment of need.",Rock,8.0
139,"The California singer and producer’s whimsical alt-pop bounces between disco beats and reggae grooves, 1960s soul and 1990s indie folk. Remi Wolf begins Big Ideas with “Cinderella,” a Soul Train-inspired disco-funk number about her everyday mood swings. Bursting with jazzy horns, triangle dings, and chirpy whistles, it’s the feel-good chromatic commotion we’ve come to expect from the Palo Alto artist. The opening track and lead single is saturated with her signature brainworms (“Cinderella making babies on the company’s dime”), but Wolf finds space for the first of many existential questions she poses on her second album: “Is there something wrong with the way I am designed?”Following in the footsteps of her 2021 debut, Juno, “Cinderella” leverages danceable beats and one-liners to mask an undercurrent of vulnerability. The rest of Big Ideas scales back the gimmickry but maintains the infectious energy, mixing Wolf’s DayGlo disco pop with detours into ’60s soul, ’90s indie folk, and psych-y prog rock. “Wave” ebbs and flows between a reggae-ish groove and emo-rock eruptions. On the surface, it comes across as a moody love song, but the Flaming Lips-inspired chorus plunges into Wolf’s anxious mindset. The heart of Big Ideas comes to light in the outro, where she verbalizes her greatest fear: “If I get too fucked up, if I get drunk all night, will you still love me?” The question could be meant for a loved one, an old flame, or even herself: Nothing cuts deeper than self-disappointment.Wolf peppers her songwriting with confessions and anecdotes, like the taste of someone she kissed at Chicago’s Empty Bottle on Halloween (“Cherries & Cream”). She’s refreshingly frank on subjects like sexuality, mental health, and sobriety. “Alone in Miami” recounts a hazy Art Basel week in Miami, cluttered with crypto bros, cocaine, and Cubano sandwiches. In “Toro,” Wolf lets her freak flag fly, spinning unflattering images like “I’m drooling like a rabid dog” into sexy come-ons. It’s no “Eating my ass like the human centipede” (from “Quiet on Set”), but it still hits.“Motorcycle” stands out as a soulful ballad that elevates a mundane premise to the stuff of fantasy. Wolf cosplays as a modern housewife who yearns for secret escapades on her Harley. “I love my motorcycle/It gets me around this funny town,” she sings, syrupy vocals floating over slow, bluesy guitar, “Pass the chaos by in this great big world/Where no one knows what they’re talking about.” Torn between the comfort of stability and the thrill of escape, Wolf ends the song on a poignantly unresolved note.Big Ideas plays like an eclectic compilation of scattered thoughts from her journal. Songs grapple with big questions but offer few answers: “Are you fearful? Do you regret?” she seemingly asks a paramour at one moment. Even “Toro” carries a tinge of melancholy, hinting at the imminent end of a euphoric night. But weaker moments can feel like half-baked ramblings (“The thing about the chase is it plagues the human race”) mistaken for storytelling. “Frog Rock” and “Pitiful”—which sounds like the Teletubbies’ version of “Buy You a Drank”—come off as lightweight goofs.If Juno was a hallucinogenic wonderland that painted the self-declared “Sexy Villain” as a comic figure, Big Ideas works to humanize Wolf’s music without sacrificing its theatricality. Closing disco fever dream “Slay Bitch,” allegedly a bonus track, is the pick-me-up to counteract all the album’s nerves and insecurities. Wolf sounds like she’s commanding you to vogue through your own dress-up montage, somersaulting through the melody with the whimsical attitude of a young Cyndi Lauper. She’s a little bit scattered, and she sounds right at home.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

140,"On an album inspired by the psychological effects of trauma, the Detroit techno pioneer and science-fiction storyteller pursues his search for new frontiers that lie far from the dancefloor. In techno, Jeff Mills is one of one, and he continues to move further from the genre norm. A remarkably prodigious icon who remains deeply associated with Detroit (though he splits his time between Paris and Miami), the 62-year-old DJ/producer is unwilling to be bound to the sounds and ideas that once defined him. A long-time sci-fi adept, he continues to use the language of techno—much of which he almost single-handedly pioneered—to comment on present-day dystopias or suggest new potentialities for anyone still willing to listen.Though Mills’ time as a turntable wizard, Underground Resistance co-founder, and techno’s ultimate ambassador and autodidact informs every inch of his music, the context of his work has stretched beyond dance culture into something wider and headier. Mills’ compositions are humanist and often highly collaborative, and created in a self-imagined environment (Black American future music gone global, fluent in advanced technology and showing Borgesian comfort with the boundlessness of storytelling), with an eye to continuously revolutionizing the milieu they came from. He remains a dance festival headliner (though, pointedly, very rarely in America), yet the stimulation behind his vast recorded output seems more focused on the mind than the ass.The EyeWitness, Mills’ second album of 2024 and one clearly reflecting the dark night of today’s human soul, is a good opportunity to hear how an electronic- and dance-music originator pushes the fruits of his legacy toward a more imaginative discourse. (It’s also one that’s easier to hear, period: After years of being unavailable on streaming platforms, the full-length releases on Mills’ Axis Records are now an easy click away.) It is a set of listening techno that, according to Mills’ liner notes, addresses the effects of shock and trauma on the contemporary condition. That The EyeWitness may have (almost) nothing to do with dancing reflects Mills’ belief that techno’s purpose and history are grounded in principles of future freedoms, intellectual mysteries, and cosmological phenomena, rather than mere physical reaction.The EyeWitness’ reaffirms Mills’ marriage of thematic narrative, psychology, and sound, and it has plenty of precedents in the producer’s recent work. His second (!) score for Fritz Lang’s classic 1927 silent film, Metropolis, released in 2023; the exploration of feeling and knowing of 2021’s more rhythm-driven The Clairvoyant; his six-part 2018 radio series The Outer Limits, made with NASA for London’s NTS Radio about the universe and astrophysics—each is a spectacular piece of musical sci-fi storytelling that questions known life’s governability, and brings to mind Samuel R. Delany more than any electronic composer or producer. Yet at their shared musical center rests what may be Detroit techno’s most crucial contribution to modern sound: layers of musical tension without release, chord patterns that don’t resolve, beats that keep unfolding, a music that embraces mystery with no clear ending. It’s a strategy that stands in direct opposition to EDM’s almighty drop and pop’s built-in limitations. It’s also a great metaphor for one way that Mills and the techno culture he represents regard the composition of a track and a set, and what they intuit the payoff to be.",Electronic,7.2
141,"On his second album, the Nigerian star pays tribute to Benin City and its history with spring-loaded rhythms and gleeful provocations. At the O2 Arena in London last November, Nigerian Afrobeats star Rema came onstage riding a glowing red-and-black horse and wearing a mask inspired by Queen Idia, a cultural icon dating to the 16th-century Kingdom of Benin. The musician hoped it would be a devastating statement on the UK’s continued hoarding of African art, including famous sculptures of Idia. Elsewhere in the show, he performed atop a giant bat, referencing a familiar sight in the skies over Benin City. But the theatrical tribute to Rema’s hometown and his people’s history was met with reactions ranging from confusion to conspiracy theories questioning whether he was part of the Illuminati.The colossal international success of Rema’s 2022 single “Calm Down” accelerated the rise of a feather-ruffling new voice in Afrobeats, one keenly aware of his potential to ascend to the level of the genre’s big three—Burna Boy, Davido, and Wizkid. That fateful show in London spurred the creation of Rema’s second album, HEIS, a record that kicks back with spring-loaded rhythms and gleeful provocations and brings the defining elements of his city front and center.Up until now, Rema was often spotted with a cuddly human-size teddy bear. On HEIS, the 24-year-old artist adopts a roguish anti-hero character, represented by a bat, who flexes with the grandiosity of a U.S. rapper: Rema as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Alexander Wang, icy wrists, and Richard Mille all wrap around the beat of the wordy yet contagious “Yayo”; on the chorus of “Hehehe,” he unleashes a cartoonishly sardonic laugh. He’s in Venice sipping Henny on the Miami bass-inspired “Azaman,” which sounds like he’s winking at you from what could be the top deck of a yacht.Rema hadn’t touched base in Benin City since 2018, having moved to Lagos before launching his career with breakout first single “Dumebi.” HEIS reconnects with his home city’s energy: Percussion moves in unbreakable clusters, dusty guitars are swapped for laser-gun synth, and strings outline the album in an ornate gold frame. “Black Bentayga, smoking a reefer,” Rema begins the title track, with Arabic strings rising around him as though Amaarae’s Fountain Baby is filling the Bentley’s speakers.At just 28 minutes, HEIS moves with ceaseless hustle. Where Rave & Roses opened with a cauldron of sentimental chords and guitar, HEIS begins with four blunt bars of 16-bit synth stabs before springing into uninterrupted action. “Follow me run, you tear your ACL,” he raps on “Azaman.” Far from the chiseled stylings of Asake and Wizkid, Rema opts for an antsy stream of consciousness with the momentum of a Ferrari. Just as the pace threatens to slow, “Ozeba” stages a blind date between snapping kuduro and the sort of deep-voiced vocal inflection Playboi Carti has toyed with recently. The chemistry is immediate.The final moments of HEIS tease a full-on heel turn. The penultimate “Villain” samples the featherweight piano of Lana Del Rey’s “A&W”—itself a song that cycles through characters and states of moral alignment—and turns it into a sinful amapiano body-winder. “Please don’t be mad at the fact that your baby na my baby don’t take it personally,” Rema sings through a Cheshire cat grin. “Now I Know” snaps out of this fantasy to touch on raw wounds. “All of my childhood I lost ’cause I wan feed family,” he cries, thinking of the struggle of caring for his loved ones after the death of his older brother at 15. It’s a moment of revelation from an album of blood-pumping madness. In going back home, Rema recasts an act of defiance as a thrilling character arc and a snapshot of his home city. It’s as exhilarating as a street race, as gothic as the bats flying above him.",Pop,7.8
142,"On his fifth album and first for Fat Possum, the Southern folk singer finds ingenious ways to pull old obscurities into the anxious present. Not so long ago, Jake Xerxes Fussell was in a hurry. The son of Southern folklorists, Fussell took his family inheritance—that is, an invaluable intimacy with customs and cultures far beyond the mainstream of his ’90s youth—and immortalized it with his earliest records. Fussell played spirited and relatively faithful versions of rather obscure old songs. Sometimes, he sped through them, though, as if he were some folk-festival stenographer, putting down what he’d heard in his own hand before it was all lost to the future’s sweep.But near the last decade’s end, on his third album, 2019’s Out of Sight, that seeming impatience began to erode, replaced by the desire to transform that inheritance into something truer to his own life and time. With his rhythmically idiosyncratic guitar and his golden mean of a folk singer’s voice, as inviting as a Sunday picnic, Fussell stitched together bits of those old tunes in ingenious shapes. It was as though Fussell finally realized just how much of his source material had made it online, ostensibly digitized forever; that work done, he could now tell his own story by using that source material in his own way and his own time, as slowly as he’d like.Fussell has never been as patient—or, for that matter, as graceful or compelling, curious or inclusive—as he is on When I’m Called, his fifth and best album. Produced by kindred spirit James Elkington and played by a cast that includes Blake Mills, Joan Shelley, and Joe Westerlund, When I’m Called foregrounds Fussell’s ability to take songs moldering in university archives or reissue label stacks and locate another meaning within them, to imagine some new way to interpret that inheritance.Fussell’s field of play is broad here, from a 1994 cassette by Maestro Gaxiola, who turned his life into a sort of anti-industry piece of performance art, to an English nursery rhyme about animals that dates at least to 1744 and may be an allegory for a half-dozen historic events. In conversation with what has come before, Fussell creates a space where our own modern malaises, whether loneliness and anxiety or political instability and social suspicion, feel less like our burdens than those of humanity at large. Fussell finds mostly forgotten songs to sing, less now to preserve them than to connect to a past we still share.Much of When I’m Called is a survey of indecision, or at least of not knowing what is supposed to come next. Most obvious is “Leaving Here, Don’t Know Where I’m Going,” a century-old Georgia lament about needing to part from home to get some work. (Another of Fussell’s folklore mentors, the late Art Rosenbaum, captured it for Folkways 40 years ago.) Framed by gentle acoustic guitar that trickles like a country creek and horns that sound like soul-baring sighs, Fussell’s tragic rendition is an existential wrestling match in slow motion. Why does pursuing what we need so often cost us what we love, like “Alabama water that tastes like cherry wine”?",Folk,8.0
143,"A concept album about killing his alter ego can’t save the impishly clever Eminem from the same tired, dated, developmentally arrested material. Eminem used to be reckless and thrilling. In the early days, he was a cruise missile slicing through the sky with the names of his targets spray-painted on the side. He aired grievances with a bullhorn, scaffolding crude insults with dynamic turns of phrase and flashy internal rhymes. Eminem could be arrestingly clever, sometimes issuing a line as meticulously written as it was shocking, but you’d never accuse him of being subtle.That was 22 years ago. A generation removed from The Eminem Show, his last great album, Eminem is a shadow of his former self. His lithe and menacing flow now feels antiseptic and strained. The high-pitched, manic tenor of his voice gave way to an ever-ratcheting growl; any East Coast groove or nervy West Coast slink in his beats was replaced by chintzy Casiotone melodrama. He became blocky and unwieldy, careening through tracks with the grace of a Cybertruck crashing into a ditch.His anger and defensiveness never dissipated, though. By the time he dropped his second album, The Marshall Mathers LP, his early screeds yearning for a colorblind hip-hop meritocracy had already lost their impact—by that point, Eminem was an unavoidable cultural force. Those diatribes sound even whinier now. He remains one of the biggest-selling and most-streamed artists in the United States, but Em’s perpetually on a back foot, like a wealthy barbarian at the gates working as hard as he can to convince his critics he’s worthy of praise. His music still clearly strikes a chord for a sizable audience, but he seems to look past them, more concerned with convincing someone—anyone—that he’s the deadliest to touch a mic.Seldom does a blockbuster album sequel recapture that initial magic; The Marshall Mathers LP 2 often felt like trying to draw the original from memory with expensive crayons. Em honed his technical skills so sharply—the lightning-speed flow on “Rap God,” the precision syllable-matching on “Legacy”—that it rendered everything sterile. Notably, he tried to distance himself from his Slim Shady character, using several songs (including the smash hit “The Monster” with Rihanna) to destroy—or at least explain away—his trollish persona. Ten years and three middling records later, he’s back to kill off his alter ego for good. The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce) is his attempt at Jungian shadow work, opening the closet for a knock-down drag-out screaming match with the skeletons.It begins with the sound of a hocked loogie. It could be Marshall Mathers trying to rid himself of the taste Slim Shady’s words leave in his mouth. Or it could just be a warning shot: This is gonna be gross. “Renaissance” functions mainly as a list of Eminem’s bona fides, comparing himself to rap legends like Big Daddy Kane and spitting lightly chuckle-worthy double entendres like, “Soon as I quit giving a fuck I started to sell a bit.” Near the end it devolves from a brash pen exercise to an attempt to shield himself from the criticism he can already feel coming. You get the distinct feeling we’ve been here before: “Premonition,” which opened Music to Be Murdered By, covered the same ground. It’s a grim harbinger that we will be exploring no new territory for the next hour.",Rap,4.8
144,"The Detroit rapper teams up with the Missouri producer on a muted album that plays out like a nostalgic travelogue. Despite his laid-back delivery, James’ verses burble with conflict and regret. A few years ago, superproducer and frequent Boldy James collaborator the Alchemist discovered that the rapper likes to write in cars. “Not even a moving vehicle,” Alchemist told Complex; “he’s just parked up with the lights on, and he gets his mind right.” That habit fits with the alert repose of the Detroiter’s ruminative drug rap. James’ music is still and relaxed, yet taut as a wound spring. At any moment, violence or emotion might erupt from the calm, like a parked vehicle charging into traffic.Boldy’s meditations have become a cottage industry since 2020. Every few months, he’ll huddle up with a single producer—like Alchemist, Jay Versace, or Nicholas Craven—and emerge with another casually prismatic street chronicle. It’s shocking how seldom he repeats himself, even as his collaborators tap similar loop-based beats. Working with one producer seems to allow Boldy to zoom in on a particular moment in time—be it the aftermath of a devastating car crash or the stressful prologue to his rap career—and capture every racing thought. On Across the Tracks, a team-up with Missouri producer Conductor Williams, Boldy sifts through recollections of life on the road and on the grind. The album is a travelogue of memories, each song grasping at some distant locale or experience.The title, which plays on producer Conductor Williams’ name, suits the music’s pensive and peripatetic mood. Conductor, one of the pillars of Griselda Records’ luxe and wavy sound, specializes in dreamy beats built around yawning samples, and this collection is his strongest. He seems to loll his samples rather than chop them, stretching sounds like taffy and then arranging drums and melodies around their elongated shapes. “Flying Trapeze Act” starts with a gorgeous vocal loop and bleeds into a star stream of percussion and chords that flicker in and out of focus as Boldy waxes about close calls. “Used to feel trapped in the ghetto, tryna to break free/On a 30-year run, I feel like an escapee,” he says with relief. Rappers often turn reflective and defiant on Conductor beats; his arrangements have the transportive sparkle of reveries.As if daydreaming, Boldy spends Across the Tracks teetering between the past and the present. He is dazzlingly limber on standout “The Ol Switcharoo,” bouncing off the clomping downbeat as he recalls life on the go. “East, west, running back and forth tryna run his money up the long way/Stepped on it like a bunion, had a run-yun for the mun-yun/Sold more circles than some Funyuns, all eyes on me through the tollways,” he raps, stretching his words to fit the soothing beat’s languid cadence. His use of directions rather than specific places reinforces the feeling that he is never at rest.",Rap,7.8
145,"Through decayed beats and gothic atmospheres, the musician formerly known as Aristophanes transforms sexual desire into an existential threat. For 潘PAN, the body is a bomb about to explode. On the 2015 Grimes track “Scream,” her voice fluttered across Mandarin lyrics about howls packed deep in the lungs like gunpowder; between delicate rap verses, she let those subdued screams erupt. The Taiwanese musician born Pan Wei Ju, previously known as Aristophanes, has toyed with the boundary between composed beauty and volcanic monstrosity ever since. On Pan the Pansexual, her first full-length release since renaming herself, 潘PAN turns her attention toward the existential threat of sexual desire, and how its satisfaction can liquefy one’s sense of identity just as easily as it can crystalize it.In 2017, 潘PAN followed her indelible Grimes feature with the mixtape Humans Become Machines, a lively, populous release that showcased a wide range of vocal moods: playful, introspective, frenetic, furious. It was a colorful affair. By contrast, Pan the Pansexual crouches in an unrelentingly bleak corner. Its beats lurch and scuttle, decaying out of time, drumming up echoes of 2010s goth records like Gazelle Twin’s Unflesh.On “Embers,” 潘PAN raps in Mandarin and sings in English over a jazzy loop whose swung rhythm scrapes against the oppressive atmosphere. The skittering cymbals hint at levity, but the synthesizer washes and pained lyrics hover in the gloom. “If I somehow die in my endless depression, I want all my beautiful illusions keep alive,” she sings in a breathy upper register while a minor-key piano figure twinkles deep in the fog. On “Reborn,” one of two tracks produced by cloud rap phenom Clams Casino, 潘PAN braids together wordless keens that call to mind Jarboe’s solo work. Here, she envisions new life emerging from violent death: “Choke me slowly with your old scars/Make me bloom once again with your blood,” she sings right before a string interlude injects a sense of old-world gothic romance into Clams’ digital static.Similar tensions simmer throughout the album. When they do resolve, they pour forth in a fury. On “FNGRMEHRDR,” over a bassline descended from Le Tigre’s electroclash classic “Deceptacon,” 潘PAN sings about a voracious desire that belies deeper longing: “I never, ever felt this lonely/Fuck it, finger me harder.” Her Mandarin lyrics, delivered at a more agitated clip, depict a totally alienated sexual encounter. “My bones are soft like mud now, my consciousness collapses, when you kiss me like the way flood spreads,” she raps. “I turned out to be a lonely person since I met you... you are making me incomplete.”Pan the Pansexual arrives during the summer of Chappell Roan and Billie Eilish, two artists who sing about queer sex as neon relief from uncertainty and repression. Roan’s “Red Wine Supernova” is an outpouring of sensual joy, while Eilish’s “LUNCH” hits like a long exhale at the end of a breath held for years. 潘PAN’s own grappling with sexual identity traces a more tortured path. What if pursuing your secret hunger didn’t calm the incalculable questions writhing in your mind, but only deepened them? What if getting off didn’t actually mean getting out? That’s the fear weighing heavy over this album—that it’s not always so easy to come home into your own body. Sometimes the bomb goes off and the question hangs in the air, unanswered.",Electronic,6.5
146,"The country crossover star’s excellent songwriting is raw and evocative, and though he continues to hone his sound, the total emotional experience of the album sometimes wears a bit thin. Some songwriters have a direct line from their open wounds to the pen on the page, and then there’s Zach Bryan. His 2019 self-produced, self-released debut album, DeAnn, was named after his mother, who died of complications related to alcoholism when Bryan was 20. Recorded during his time as an aviation ordnanceman in the Navy, its ragged songs detail grief and regret, devotion that leads to violence, family curses and hard-won redemption. Bryan’s passion and pathos garnered him a cult following that turned him into a stadium-filling superstar, and though he now records and travels with a full band—not to mention guest stars like Maggie Rogers, Bruce Springsteen, and the “Hawk Tuah” girl—his work still carries the stark intensity and emotional bareness of a heart-to-heart with a stranger after one too many beers.His new album, The Great American Bar Scene, adds to the Zach Bryan formula by taking on a wider lens, weaving his personal struggles and triumphs into the greater legacy of lost souls and camaraderie found in America’s watering holes. This can lead to exciting new lyrical territory for him, like on “Oak Island,” a tightly wound character song about a railroad worker whose brother’s gotten into trouble with some boys from New Jersey. His protagonist, Mickey, also appears on the title track—this time as a nod to malt liquor—in a story that starts off with getting played by a bookie from Philly, winds through a police chase in Cheyenne, and ends with swaying to Johnny Cash with some sweet young thing under neon lights. In the background, you can hear the ambient sound of balls clanking in a game of pool, timed to the strums of the guitar.It’s all very Nebraska, a comparison that’s hung over Bryan since his early lo-fi releases. He even tries to get ahead of the punchline here, with references to “State Trooper” and “Reason to Believe” and a duet with the Boss himself on “Sandpaper.” Ironically, the sound of Bar Scene is the most full-bodied of Bryan’s career, building upon the heartland rock that he explored in his 2022 major-label breakthrough American Heartbreak and the self-titled follow-up from last year. Bryan makes the kind of production choices here associated with someone gaining a lot more money and creative control in a short amount of time, deploying mariachi horns, gospel choirs and, yes, a John Mayer guitar solo to complete his vision. They mostly work, though maybe not surprisingly, Bryan’s folksier instincts shine the most: the moments of lonesome pedal steel and guitar-pickin’, the skilled harmonies with Noeline Hofmann on “Purple Gas,” and the showstopping harmonica on “Pink Skies.” That song, an account of DeAnn’s funeral, is so meticulously constructed that you can see exactly why, against all odds, it was picked as the album’s lead single.",Folk,7.0
147,"The indie rock vet’s intimate songwriting comes to life in blossoming arrangements seemingly plucked straight out of a vintage California bachelor pad. Chris Cohen writes songs so gentle and sweet they seem to practically nuzzle up against you, but he hasn’t always intended to be a steward of comfort. “I think that there’s something in my music that people misinterpret as like, contentment or being chill,” he told Flaunt in 2020, lamenting the times he’s noticed his laid-back bedroom pop crop up as background music in restaurants or at Urban Outfitters. “It might be something that I’m not succeeding at as a musician that makes people think that I think the world is fine and we should just feel good,” he said. “That’s like, the last thing that I want people to get from my music.”Cohen’s curse may just be that he’s too adept at crafting gorgeous, heavenly little songs. If there’s one throughline between the various projects he’s been a part of—be it Deerhoof, Weyes Blood, Ariel Pink’s Haunted Graffiti, or the Curtains—it’s this sense of him tapping out cracks in the edges of soft pop without ever letting it shatter. “Damage,” the opening track off Paint a Room (his first new album in five years) puts this dichotomy front and center: As Cohen, dismayed, sings about how abuses of power manifest in society, a summery bed of horns courtesy of Jeff Parker envelops his dread in a pastoral calm. “Somebody’s love was shot down again,” he coos, just moments before a smooth saxophone solo swirls into view.Paint a Room is full of these types of frozen-in-time vignettes, as Cohen’s intimate songwriting comes to life in blossoming arrangements seemingly plucked straight out of a vintage California bachelor pad. Inspired by Uruguayan and Brazilian artists like Eduardo Mateo and Milton Nascimento, who pushed their folk pop to proggy, boundless new places in the ’70s and ’80s, Cohen lines his songs with flutes, congas, and Clavinets that instill a psychedelically tropical lilt. At times, the subtly pretty haze can threaten to dissipate into thin air, but its highs demonstrate why Cohen remains one of indie rock’s most quietly wondrous songwriters.Cohen’s melodies convey everything his songs need completely on their own (he typically plots out all his chords and phrasings well in advance of figuring out what to actually say). His hooks can feel so simple and intuitive that it’s as if they’ve always been there: The central piano motif in “Dog’s Face” materializes as gracefully as a mist unspooling over the Bay, before a lightly dissonant guitar riff begins to pulse like distant thunder. The ghostly keyboard riff in “Randy’s Chimes” creeps around as if it were solving a mystery, while “Physical Address” cruises on a playful bossa-nova groove that glides up and down like a kid riding an elevator. When Cohen does attempt to say something more concrete with his lyrics, his concerns tend toward searching for hope in the modern day. On the radiant “Sunever,” he speaks to a transgender child about the future: “Up and up you climb, soon you’ll leave us far behind,” he murmurs tenderly, promising them that “you’re gonna find a way” and letting a joyous fiddle paint the path.",Rock,7.4
148,"On its fourth album, the Oakland duo uses disco-fueled dance grooves and gently psychedelic atmospheres as vehicles for introspection. A solid groove can be a gateway to the sublime. When the rhythm section locks in just right, it triggers a profound physiological response: As your hips move and head bobs, cortisol levels drop, replaced with a blissful rush of dopamine. Time may start to lose its shape, marked only by the throb of a kick or tick of a hi-hat. Songs throughout the ages have spoken to the ecstasy of getting lost in music, celebrating the ways that dancing can make one’s troubles vanish and wipe the emotional slate clean.Brijean Murphy understands this transformative power. She’s long been an in-demand live and session percussionist, bolstering the pulse of artists like Mitski, Toro y Moi, Poolside, and U.S. Girls. After years of playing for hire, Murphy realized that the freelance life was losing its sustainability. With the encouragement of friends and her partner, multi-instrumentalist and producer Doug Stuart, she began recording her own songs. Since 2018, the duo of Murphy and Stuart (operating under Murphy’s first name, à la Sade), has been making warm, lightly psychedelic dance music that weaves together bits of tropicália, Latin jazz, house, disco, and dream pop, placing emphasis on Murphy’s command of undulating rhythms. Macro, their fourth and most ambitious album, is a seductive invitation to boogie on the astral plane.Brijean’s debut, 2018’s Walkie Talkie, was set deep in the tropics, but they’ve never stayed in one place for long. On each successive release the duo has sharpened its pop instincts, adding instruments and collaborators, and widening its scope beyond easy genre tags. Macro’s swooning arrangements bloom and bend, revealing a band comfortable with experimenting within the boundaries of a certain sound. The Vancouver bounce of “Counting Sheep” morphs into stoned lounge music with the addition of a syncopated triangle. A sound collage briefly interrupts the ’60s mod swing of “Bang Bang Boom,” setting up the swirling psych of the song’s jammy coda. They’ve maintained a mimosa-and-CBD-gummy chill that gently nods at the sun-drunk, day-glo jams Murphy’s collaborators in Poolside make, but Brijean’s work has more depth. Even at their most billowing, these songs maintain a slight edge, an understanding that it’s easier to get to a place of cathartic release when your muscles are already tense.Twenty-five seconds into “Euphoric Avenue,” Murphy coos a sincere concern: “All I know is time moves much too fast.” Lightly picked guitar, synthesized strings, and ringing chimes run together as her words descend, leaving a vapor trail of reverb in their wake. Such a definitive, almost anxious phrase seems at odds with the pleasant instrumental fog that surrounds it, but as soon as Murphy intones the word “fast,” a waltzing bossa nova drum beat snaps to life, bongos rippling behind it. On “Breathe,” a plea for slowing down, Murphy asserts that she wants “to do more things that don’t take currency.” Her silvery voice uncurls over the lush but jittery breakbeat soundscape; the song is governed by an existential tug between ecstatic abandon and the looming dread of waking up the same as you ever were.",Electronic,7.5
149,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit the 2000 album from one of the most famous and influential musicians in South Asian history, a spare, heart-rending, spiritually transcendent experience. You’d think that one of the greatest vocalists of all time might have some notes for rising musicians. But as a judge on the 2012 reality singing competition Sur Kshetra, famed Pakistani Sufi singer Abida Parveen was often exceedingly neutral. When asked in an interview why she avoids sharing criticism despite being appointed as a judge, she responded with her typical wisdom: “Because it’s music, not war.” The journalist interviewing her followed up, asking who she hoped would win the competition. “I pray Allah makes a good decision. That’s all.”Parveen’s humility and diplomacy are almost comical given her position as one of the most famous and influential musicians in South Asian history. When she was 5, her father chose her over her brothers to become his successor in their family practice of Sufi singing, and by the age of 23, she was named the official singer of Radio Pakistan, the national public broadcaster for radio in the country. Now 70 years old, Parveen, who is often referred to as “the queen of Sufi music,” has released over a hundred albums, received the Nishan-e-Imtiaz—Pakistan’s highest civilian award—and is credited with helping popularize Sufi music and culture among young people in South Asia and around the world.Parveen’s modesty despite her immense success is part of her religion. She makes music in the tradition of Sufism, a mystical, philosophical expression of Islam that began in the 10th century. Sufism prioritizes spiritual purification, a divine, intoxicating connection with God, and a sense of humility that comes from prioritizing that connection above all earthly desires. In interviews, Parveen often deemphasizes her importance as a person, instead positioning her performances as a means for communing with God. “The truth doesn’t need to be told,” she said in an interview in 2001. “It can only be experienced. Remember, I’m not performing. He is singing through me. It is His song, and it sings by itself.”Sufism also specifically deprioritizes the role of the singer in music-making. The Sufi practice of sama’—listening to music with the intention of achieving closeness to God—instead privileges the listener. The concept of sama’ has inspired artistic movements across the globe from Turkey’s whirling dervishes to Morocco’s Gnaoua music, which has had an outsized influence on jazz greats in the West like Ornette Coleman and Pharoah Sanders, to name just a couple.On stage, when Parveen channels the greatness of God, she transforms completely. She sometimes hallucinates while on stage, or brings the audience to tears by singing just a few notes. Nowhere is her singular vocal talent clearer than on her excellent 2000 album Raqs-e-Bismil. The album title translates to “Dance of the Wounded,” and on the record, Parveen conveys burning desire and yearning for God through the subtleties of her singing: the poise with which she delivers a single note, the husky, smoldering tone of her voice, her interplay between precision and fervor. She’s often compared to Nina Simone, whose shows have been described as “having the aura of sacramental rites.” The two artists sing with such dynamism and heart that when you listen to them, you feel transported beyond the limitations of your body and individual perceptions and into a spiritual realm of infinite possibility.",Folk,9.3
150,"Interweaving spiritual jazz, thumping rhythms, and contributions from a tight-knit group of collaborators, the Nicaraguan Canadian musician imbues his fifth LP with the warmth of human connection. A simple tenet guides Brandon Miguel Valdivia’s music as Mas Aya: “The more personal you can make music, the more interesting it is.” He does just that on his fifth album, Coming and Going. On “Be,” the Nicaraguan Canadian percussionist and producer passes the mic to his young daughter, Martina, and Valdivia’s partner and co-parent, Lido Pimienta, appears throughout the album—as she did on 2021’s Máscaras—softening Mas Aya’s twitchy, organically textured beatscapes to the point that they feel like the fruit of a family jam session.Spending an afternoon with Valdivia and Pimienta sounds like it must be enchanting, considering the duo’s vast range of experiences, credits, and collaborations—from remixing Run the Jewels to starring on a children’s television show with Beverly Glenn-Copeland. Keeping busy throughout pandemic purgatory, Valdivia and Pimienta not only became parents, but moved from cosmopolitan Toronto to the comparatively suburban London, Ontario. Coming and Going was initially composed around field recordings that Valdivia collected at his parents’ house, drawing upon Buddhist spiritual practices to create a sense of tranquility within the frantic beats, like Arthur Russell after listening to Traxman.Coming and Going boasts a patient, panoramic sound that embraces a lifetime of disparate cultures, communities, and influences. Valdivia welcomes house music’s pulse under spiritual jazz’s sprawling tent; the album gathers together a village of guest players, such as Afro-Cuban percussionist Reimundo Sosa, trumpeter Nicole Rampersaud, and Josh Cole on bowed bass. “Dora” and “Windless, Waveless,” the album’s bouncy opening songs, flash back to folktronica-era Four Tet and Caribou. “Ocarina” is anything but a reference to The Legend of Zelda, wrapping Rob Clutton’s luminous electric bass in rustling percussion and Rampersaud’s bright streaks of horn. Pumping pianos reminiscent of Mas Aya’s labelmate Scott Hardware echo throughout “What Shattering!” and the astonishing “No Trace,” an oasis of jazzy ambient bliss with vocals from fellow Toronto musician Isla Craig.By the time he reaches closer “Abre Camino,” Valdivia has stretched all the way out, filling nearly seven minutes with shimmering synths, wooden flutes, and rhythms piled upon rhythms. Miraculously, these kinds of densely crisscrossed threads soothe instead of stress, drifting deeper into the ambient dimensions of Mas Aya’s music. On Máscaras, his music’s spiritual dimension masked political subtexts that were revealed in samples of street protests and revolutionary poets. This time, the personal is political. Alongside the warmly tactile sounds of the album’s innumerable interwoven instruments, the loving presence of the two primary people in Valdivia’s life, and an even larger chosen family of close collaborators, creates a human connection so strong you can feel it. One way of pushing back against injustice, he suggests, is simply existing in the here and now with your loved ones—an action so potent it needs no words to resonate.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

151,"Sturgill Simpson’s outstanding album under a new stage name expertly balances cosmic and outlaw country and reintroduces himself as the premier Nashville outsider. Who the fuck is Sturgill Simpson? Folks have been asking that question ever since A Sailor’s Guide to Earth was surprise-nominated for the 2016 Grammy for Album of the Year alongside Beyoncé, Drake, Justin Bieber, and eventual winner Adele. It became a meme for a few months, with Sturgill even selling T-shirts and sporting a new one at Bonnaroo that read, “Who the fuck is asking?” It all seemed like a good joke at the time, maybe even a pointed commentary on how talent goes unrecognized in Nashville, but the question sums up Simpson’s career; nobody has been asking more than the man himself. He posed it repeatedly on his first three albums, which, in retrospect, form a loose trilogy about losing and finding himself—in Nashville (2013’s High Top Mountain), in the cosmos (2014’s Metamodern Sounds in Country Music), and on the high seas (Sailor’s Guide).Since that Grammy nomination, however, Sturgill has become much harder to pin down, for himself and for us. He seemed to get lost in different roles: first the guitar shredder on the 2019 manga soundtrack SOUND & FURY, then the bluegrass auteur on not one but two acoustic albums, and finally an outlaw troubadour on the song cycle The Ballad of Dood & Juanita. After rupturing his vocal cords in 2021, he announced his retirement from touring, then unretired for a short tour earlier this year. But he is still making good on his promise to record no more than five albums of new material, which represent “the traditional Christian narrative of the journey of the human soul.” The bluegrass records don’t count because they’re almost entirely retreads of older songs. And his latest is not technically a Sturgill Simpson album.Credited to Johnny Blue Skies, Passage du Desir is simultaneously two things that seem completely contradictory. It’s the first album Simpson has released under a pseudonym, and it’s also the true follow-up to A Sailor’s Guide to Earth. In addition to ditching his given name, he chucks most of the R&B horns and Bakersfield riffs that punctuate his previous songs in favor of percolating percussion, cosmic string arrangements, and bluesier guitars. This is country music caught between earthiness and spaciness, and it reintroduces him as one of Nashville’s oddest artists, who understands and subverts both the square mainstream and the outlaw fringes of country music. It’s been only three years since Dood & Juanita, but Passage still feels like a comeback.",Folk,8.5
152,"The Australian producer and vocalist tells stories of anguished romance over crisp drums and crystalline melodies. When she’s not dragged down by bland hooks and generic beats, she glitters. As KUČKA, Laura Jane Lowther makes moody electronic music that flickers with angst and glee. After breaking through as a background vocalist on LongLiveA$AP and cutting her teeth on the Perth, Australia live circuit, she made her name as a singer for club-ready rap and dance tracks. Her diaphanous voice can slink through or float over a mix, a quality that has landed Lowther placements on madcap beats by SOPHIE and Flume, and on mellower arrangements by Mount Kimbie and Andrei Eremin. On features, many of which are uncredited, KUČKA’s singing tends to function more as a texture than as a centerpiece—but in her solo work, she pushes against that reputation.“Absolutely no vocal features,” she declared as she prepared Wrestling, her 2021 debut album. The mostly self-produced record showcased the anguished romantic beneath the ethereal voice, its misty and brooding beats bringing out a sensuality and tension often muted in KUČKA’s guest spots. She sounded less like a manic pixie dream girl—or an “alien, sexy space lady” as regular collaborator Flume once more colorfully described her timbre—and more like a person navigating life’s ups and downs. Follow-up Can You Hear Me Dreaming? has a similarly corrective mission, showcasing KUČKA’s takes on synth-pop, R&B, and dance while emphasizing narrative. If Wrestling was a waking dream, this album is a lucid one.KUČKA again handles most of the production, assisted by Flume, sauna6, and pnkblnkt. The beats vary in style but generally feature crisp drums, crystalline melodies, and lots of negative space. The minimalism somewhat recalls Jessy Lanza and early SBTRKT, but KUČKA’s low ends aren’t as deep, nor are her synth melodies as syncopated. As an arranger, she’s more concerned with clarity than propulsion. Even the brisker songs feel inviting, their breezy arrangements as beckoning as a body pillow.Leaning into this cozy mode, KUČKA structures these songs around stories of intimacy and romance. Opener “Wasting Time (til the end of the world)” centers on a fault that emerges in a relationship as a pair tries to outrun the apocalypse. “We got the music blasting along the motorway/But nowhere left to go/Why can’t you understand?/Look at me I’m serious,” KUČKA sings with irritation. The shuffling garage beat ups the tension; the couple might bottom out before the world does. Other lovers mentioned across the album fare better. The earnest narrator of chippy single “Cry Cry Cry” is brought to tears by the accepting gaze of her partner. And “Heaven,” a minimal R&B track flecked with icy synth melodies and chimes, turns vacation planning into seduction. “Nothing but our sweat and our own skin/We don’t need a week on an island,” KUČKA sings, her voice both pleading and affirmative.",Electronic,6.9
153,"Claire Cottrill’s third album sinks deeper into a soft-rock sound as her songwriting takes on an understated new confidence. On the final track of her third album, Clairo finds herself at the pier, “playing out moments when there was a touch.” Just a touch: more intimate than pining from afar, sure, but not a kiss or even so much as an embrace. These kinds of experiences—when the memory of a tiny gesture captures the entirety of your attention—are hallmarks of Claire Cottrill’s best songwriting, like the flushed cheeks of “Bags” or the objectifying glances of “Blouse.” On Charm, she retains her attention to these fleeting touches, but pairs them with a lush, rich production, sinking deeper into a soft rock sound that is at once smoldering and whimsical.Charm is not a dramatic shift in the manner of Clairo’s second album, 2021’s Sling. After she achieved viral fame as a teen on the strength of her sweetly lo-fi YouTube uploads, Clairo released Immunity, her impressive Rostam Batmanglij-produced debut. Then she took a left turn. She moved to upstate New York, teamed with producer Jack Antonoff, and holed up in the woods to make Sling. Where Immunity showed off Clairo’s kinship with bedroom pop darlings like Frankie Cosmos, Sling worshiped at the altar of Carole King—a pastoral, folky album that seemed entirely uninterested in chasing her past or reaching for new pop hits.To make Charm, Clairo worked with another new producer, Leon Michels, known for his work in the El Michels Affair and as a member of the Dap-Kings. Together, they dug deeper into the ’70s palette Clairo developed on Sling and crafted arrangements dense with Wurlitzer, mellotron, piano, and organ. “Slow Dance” ends with fluttering flute and clarinet; “Terrapin” is filled with piano flourishes. If Antonoff’s production on Sling sometimes felt cool or atmospheric, Charm emits a palpable warmth. Plus, most of these songs groove. Clairo’s vocals remain, by and large, hushed, but thanks to the golden-hued production, her voice comes across more like a murmur in a crush’s ear than a sheepish mumble on a first date.The intimate experiences that Clairo examines on Charm have to do, she’s said, with “fleeting moments … where I’ve been charming or have been charmed” and the fantasies such moments can produce. It’s a mood Charm’s sensual confidence and retro propulsion readily conjures: “You make me wanna/Go buy a new dress,” she sings on “Juna,” “You make me wanna/Slip off a new dress.” On “Sexy to Someone,” a cozy song about wanting to be wanted, Clairo’s feather-light voice sways atop playful production you could almost call funky. Even in more downcast moments—when Clairo sings of mourning a love while “all alone upstate,” or describes how she’ll “pull on the string/That binds me to memories of/The way I loved you”—the music never wallows.Rarely do these songs stray from this sophisticated palette. It suits her well, but it marks Charm as yet another successful but polite soft-rock outing, a format with somewhat diminishing returns. One song towards the album’s end breaks away gently from the rest: “Echo,” a spacey highlight where psychedelic synths and Clairo’s droning delivery bring it closer to Broadcast than Carly Simon. It’s a strange tune about a love that “goes nowhere,” whose musical gestures enhance its lyrical ones. These are the quotidian details and the tiny imperfections that make Clairo’s music uniquely alluring. It’s a new kind of Clairo song, but it has what makes the best Clairo songs so unforgettable.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

154,"At once telegenic and slightly tongue in cheek, the Montreal composer’s ersatz chamber music is proof that you can love something and poke fun at it at the same time. Imagine this: you’re watching an actor in his mid-fifties playing a politician—a tall white guy with a good head of hair and a crisp blue suit, who greets his adoring public after a successful rally. Think a very special episode of Scandal. People cheer, they wave signs of support. Our great nation beholds its benevolent leader. And then, entering from the side of the screen comes a scary freak dressed in dark clothes. He has a gun! Pop, pop, pop. Screams, commotion. As the camera pans out to take in the bedlam, the music enters, just as you expect. An orchestral piece scaled down to computer size, its patriotic flattening uncanny. This is the music of a real crisis in a fake nation. Will our country survive? That is the question being urgently asked by d’Eon’s imagined score. On “The President Has Been Shot,” the song with the most appropriate title of all time, the oboes are distressed, the cellos are deeply upset, and the violins pump fast enough to match the speed of our racing hearts.Though Montreal producer Chris d’Eon always leaned toward a telegenic brand of miniaturized chamber music, at first it seemed like that predilection was an accent, not the focus itself. On 2011’s Darkbloom, a split LP with then-fellow underground Canadian producer Grimes, his sacramental trilling was blended with an instrument largely absent from his new music: drums. The use of percussion, largely owing to various forms of Chicago dance music, from house to footwork, was the least interesting part of the music, but the most prominent. Dropping the propulsion to focus on warped melodies has created a new lane, one in between the avant-garde and the heavenly, the classical and the canned. In the past decade, he’s released several volumes of fairly straight-ahead liturgical music via his Music for Keyboards series, though in the context of his much more fulsome new album Leviathan, those records seem more like a dare to see if he could do it, a mastering of mimicry along the way to truly finding his own goofier voice.Much of the music on his new album, like “The President Has Been Shot,” is dramatic, but, importantly, self-knowing. Yes, you can love a thing and make fun of it at the same time. This is music that sits somewhere between religious and hold music, where purgatory is both subject and experience. Two other tracks, in addition to “The President,” describe an action: “Climbing the Overhang” and “Installation of the Cisterns.” The former takes a playful approach with bloopy ’80s digi-funk synths, like climbing an overhang is an accomplishment that might have happened on The Jeffersons. The latter, with digital zither and bells giving the track a MIDI-gamelan feel, is ceremonial but a little sinister. These cisterns might end up as a part of a zany plot in Oceans 14.",Electronic,6.9
155,"The California producer’s next-gen dubstep rolls shards of digicore, hyperpop, shoegaze, and ASMR into elaborately pixelated clouds of chaos. For a moment in the early 2010s, dubstep was the delirious new sound of the electronic world. The laser-bright synths and vomity wubs of sub-scenes like brostep and riddim took over from the stark, murky UK style of the aughts and set the festival circuit ablaze. We all know how that ended, but the style never really died, and now the kids who grew up mainlining music from Monstercat and Trap Nation are throwing up their own futuristic insanity and calling it dubstep. Perhaps the most thrilling new-gen producer is Syzy—a virtuosic sound designer whose new album, The weight of the world, is the genre’s most intoxicating debut in years.The California producer has worked in the shadows for a while now, dropping a couple of ear-lacerating dubstep EPs and experimenting with madcap side quests in the SoundCloud underworld. They made dariacore mashup weirdness and internet-fried Jersey club as a member of the anarchic collective TwerkNation28; cult streamer iShowSpeed hijacked one of their beats for an infectious viral hit. The weight of the world combines these zany impulses with pristine technical know-how. It’s an artful take on a genre often reviled as mindless carnage.These songs feel like gazing at pixelated constellations where synth shards glisten between dark clouds of bass fog. Syzy stacks the songs’ sumptuous intros and outros with vocal slivers, infernal burbles, and ASMR-soft twinkles. Ornate drops feel less suited for raving than paying close attention. “HEART123” sparkles madly, as if a glacier could be stretched like an accordion. The ecstatic climax of “Caught up (in circles)” is like seeing color after a life of monochrome. “Get a grip!” deftly ratchets up the tension, then pops two drops in quick succession: The first is gnarly but it’s a pump fake compared to the fantastically feculent second, which resembles a robot-monster puking a torrent of neon-green bile.The weight of the world feels so immersive partly because Syzy didn’t intend it to be purely functional. Rather than macho bass or daredevil drops, the artist cites hyperpop and homespun alt-rock (like twikipedia’s “seams”) as primary influences on this record’s emotionally vertiginous sound palette. The eruption of chattering noise on the intro smacks of Jane Remover’s “kodak moment.” The kitschy “Eureka!” sample motif is redolent of something off an Underscores tape. “In your face!” shivers with Rustie-shiny synths, as if bass wizard G Jones took a course in PC Musicology. The five-minute outro to “Experience (HIGHER)” is so packed with blurred bleeps and pixelated mist it’s like shoegaze for cyborgs.",Electronic,7.2
156,"The singer-songwriter’s second album sharpens the darkness of a romantic estrangement into glittering pop gems. Apollo is still full of longing, but he’s ready to show his claws. On his second album, God Said No, Omar Apollo wields his heartbreak like a butterfly knife. On “Done With You,” an airy, brass-assisted pop song, he cloaks moments of devastating vulnerability with a protective layer of detached cool. In the shrugged-off chorus, he insists that he’s done with his lover—a toughness that stands in stark contrast to his earlier, velvety pleas for them to let him go. The video matches this energy, depicting the star as he alternates between waving blades at the viewer and running them painfully along his jawline. It’s a fitting visual representation of a record where Apollo sharpens some of his darkest moments into glinting pop gems.God Said No originated from three months Apollo spent in London in 2023. Following the release of his debut full-length Ivory in 2022, tours with SZA and Billie Eilish, and a nomination for Best New Artist at the 2023 Grammys, the Mexican American singer-songwriter was riding a professional high, but privately nursing a broken heart as he surveyed the wreckage of a relationship. Working with familiar collaborators Teo Halm (here as executive producer), Carter Lang, and Blake Slatkin, Apollo first sketched out the 14 songs in the prestigious Abbey Road Studios, later finishing the album in the U.S. With his biggest hit to date being the gut-wrenching “Evergreen (You Didn’t Deserve Me at All),” Apollo already has something of a reputation as a heartbreak aficionado—as he recently Complex, “my natural state is always longing.” But on this record, he paints that emotion with every shade on his palette. God Said No stretches far beyond downbeat balladeering; Apollo weaves his sadness, anger, and self-doubt through a collection of anthemic choruses and disco-tinged pop tracks.On “Less of You” and “Drifting,” Apollo recalls Robyn’s style of tearful dancefloor anthem, the former combining Giorgio Moroder-esque vocoder melodies with a eulogy for a relationship that’s slowly evanescing, and the latter sprinkling Apollo’s romantic disillusionment over a breezy, Balearic-type beat. These shades of understated Europop are a new element of Apollo’s sound, brooding where once he might have belted. But his voice remains the star of the show, particularly when he’s trading gorgeous, tumbling melodies with Sudanese Canadian singer-songwriter Mustafa on the plaintive “Plane Trees.”While they are often luxurious to listen to, Apollo’s ballads represent the album’s least compelling moments. “Empty” and “Dispose of Me” meander drowsily, doing little to distinguish this record from his previous bedroom R&B releases. A meditative voice note about grief from Pedro Pascal also wears thin on repeat listens. The album is more arresting when Apollo knowingly leans into the more unhinged aspects of heartbreak. Take the rousing lead single, “Spite,” where, with a hook that bristles with delicious fury, Apollo walks a razor-thin line between loving and hating the partner who’s keeping him hanging on. Over sulky licks of guitar, he brings the confusing loneliness of a situationship to life through bittersweet vignettes of dying flowers, unread text messages, and long flights taken alone. Elsewhere, he howls an embittered and desperate hook on the expansive “How,” his anger as coldly insistent as the drum machine that backs it.These wild-eyed moments hint at more complex and ambitious possibilities for Apollo as a storyteller and as a pop star. On “Life’s Unfair,” a strutting funk-pop song, Apollo coolly admits to doing “something real bad” to someone he once wanted to marry. The trap-inflected standout “Against Me” takes a kind of hyper-masculine, posturing response to being dumped. On these songs, Apollo may be full of longing, but he’s also flawed, fired-up, and the self-proclaimed “baddest bitch.” God Said No stands apart from Apollo’s previous releases not only because of its genre experimentation and its stickier choruses, but for its willingness to get ugly. Here, Apollo has been knocked down, but he doesn’t play the victim. Instead, he bares his teeth.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

157,"Recorded across four nights of longform improv at L.A.’s Enfield Tennis Academy, then cut up and remixed, the quintet’s debut marks an exciting milestone in the city’s emerging jazz scene. There were no rules at Enfield Tennis Academy. The tiny Los Angeles cocktail bar, with its specialty in avant-garde jazz and a name that winked at David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest, dodged any accusations of snobbishness by cutting out the usual strictures: no two-drink minimum, no ban on talking or cell phones, and for a while at least, no cover charge. ETA became a destination for the new jazz scene’s westward migration from Chicago to L.A.; a weekly improv session led by Tortoise and Isotope 217 guitarist Jeff Parker was the highlight of the schedule, and a phenomenal recording of those shows, 2022’s Mondays at the Enfield Tennis Academy, finally let the world know what was happening in the cramped back space of that long, narrow club. But despite its momentum, ETA officially shut down at the end of 2023, closing another chapter in the history of West Coast jazz.It will take a long time to uncover the full extent of ETA’s influence on the L.A. scene. So let’s start now, with SML, a new quintet who recorded their debut album, Small Medium Large, across four nights of longform improvisation at the venue. The group represents the next wave of jazz artists to hit the western shore: saxophonist Josh Johnson, synthesist Jeremiah Chiu, and guitarist Gregory Uhlmann are all Windy City transplants. Bassist Anna Butterss arrived in L.A. from Australia via Indiana, while percussionist Booker Stardrum was drawn there from his native New York. (Butterss and Johnson also happen to appear on Mondays at the ETA). They take their cue from an important record on Chicago’s International Anthem imprint, Makaya McCraven’s 2015 album In the Moment, on which he cut up and remixed live improvisations to create a fusion between jazz and hip-hop. SML shares McCraven’s method but not his style; rearranging their concert recordings in their home studios, the group crafted a set of songs that drives like Afrobeat and drifts like kosmische.The post-production technique is sometimes identifiable—the ultra-fast loops of “Switchboard Operations,” for example, belong on a classic Oval track—but the fervent energy of the live performance shines throughout. “Three Over Steel” begins with nine or 10 seconds of a reverse tape effect and then plows ahead with an undeniable groove. This is either live jazz or a facsimile too good to spot, right down to the way Uhlmann’s guitar solo picks its way through delicate one-note stretches while the audience holds their breath. At other times, the degree of editing is irrelevant. “Dolphin Language” is a new-age wash of ambient synthesis more remarkable for its calm, aquatic atmosphere than for any display of chops, whether on an instrument or a DAW.",Electronic,7.8
158,"N/A In the Rebel Alliance to resurrect Real Rock’n’Roll, Art Brut frontman Eddie Argos viewed himself as Luke Skywalker. How else are we meant to interpret one particular live version of the band’s 2007 single “Pump Up the Volume,” which opens with John Williams’ Star Wars title theme before the horns crash into the song’s swaggering first notes?When Art Brut first met in 2002, at a party hosted by short-lived London indie darlings Ciccone, NME’s number-one ranked album was Coldplay’s A Rush of Blood to the Head. The early aughts post-punk revival was bursting at the seams (Interpol’s Turn on the Bright Lights came out the same year), but the pop charts could barely manage a distortion pedal. British music media was similarly fractured—BBC’s Top of the Pops was sprinting towards its swan song, while NME and Kerrang! struggled to adapt to the velocity of new online-only publications. Armed with Argos’, well, brute sprechgesang and wielding their guitars like battle axes, Art Brut painted themselves as the saviors of a dying scene. On two new compilations titled after lyrics, the 2xLP A Record Collection, Reduced to a Mixtape and the 5xCD box set And Yes, This Is My Singing Voice!, Art Brut assemble their studio recordings, B-sides, and a handful of electrifying live cuts that argue that the scene, in turn, saved them.In the nearly 20 years since the band’s debut, 2005’s Bang Bang Rock & Roll, it seems painfully clear that Argos has failed to write “the song that makes Israel and Palestine get along,” or to pen the next “Happy Birthday,” as he declared on “Formed a Band.” But Art Brut’s influence on contemporary indie rock has only grown since their last album, 2018’s Wham! Bang! Pow! Let’s Rock Out!. The echo of Argos’ cocksure yet self-aware monotone can be heard in Joe Casey’s tortured soliloquies for Protomartyr, the deadpan nonsequiturs of Dry Cleaning’s Florence Shaw, or the fever-pitch rants of Idles’ Joe Talbot. And while the band’s lyrical themes—falling in love with girls, starting a band to make out with girls, loving music more than making out—appear provincial compared to their politically minded disciples, Argos’ contemptuous streak has resurfaced in a recent crop of British bands like Yard Act and Squid. These newer groups might couch their music in the alienation of late capitalism, but fundamentally, they’re asking the same question that Argos barked back in 2005: “Why don’t our parents worry about us?”",Rock,7.0
159,"The prodigious singer reunites with producer D’Mile for a collection of live-band soul and future-R&B that aspires to update the classic seduction jam with a dose of modern vulnerability. As the singer of unforgettable tracks like “Over” and “Love You Too Much,” and as a songwriter on Ella Mai’s “10,000 Hours” and Beyoncé’s “Alien Superstar,” Lucky Daye’s spent at least a decade cultivating a terrarium of earworm hits. On this third album, Algorithm, Daye reunites with Dernst “D’Mile” Emile II, whose agile production can be heard on An Evening With Silk Sonic and Victoria Monet’s Jaguar series as well as Daye’s first two albums. The duo’s balance of retro-soul and future-R&B is a little left of center, freewheeling without any discernible label, and focuses on instrumental exploration and playful genre-melding.Across Algorithm’s 14 tracks, live-band seduction pulls you out of the club shadows and into the light of a Delta dancefloor. Opener “Never Leavin’ U Lonely” is a sexy party trick, the type of song that sneaks up and surprises as it builds from its percussive backline into Daye’s falsetto vocals. It’s a high that continues onto the hip-swinging “HERicane,” the shoulder shimmying “Soft,” and the heart-pounding “Top.” The latter brings to mind the instructional foreplay of Eugene Wilde’s “Gotta Get You Home Tonight,” whose influence is felt in Daye’s plea for an itinerant lover’s time and interest: “I feel your body breathin’ but let’s not take a break…/Like sugar on my tongue till your body go numb/Then I’ma send you on your way.” Just because it’s a one-night stand doesn’t mean it’s over—Daye wants you to remember the first glance and the last climax.At its best, the album recalls the dynamic sensual abandon of Nile Rodgers as Daye rides over the grooves and edges of a melody. He never seems to be addressing a crowd: He is seeing and singing to you. Fans of old-school R&B ballads bemoan that today’s singers don’t beg like they used to, that there’s no urgency in their pining. Daye is prostrate, submitting to desire. When he steps away from that vulnerable longing, though, the album starts to meander with the listlessness of an automated “sex songs” playlist.“Think Different,” “Mary,” “Blame,” and the title track attempt to engage with the contemporary dating scene’s surplus of choices and dearth of intimacy, but the real problem never comes into clear focus and the songs wind up sounding like one-way romantic pontificating. “Mary” in particular feels quite archaic as Daye consults a Rolodex of women he’s met in each and every part of town. “Got a girl named Jill, stay up in the hills,” he brags, and so on, revealing nothing except the fact that there are still young women named Ruth. “Think Different” could have been a necessary dialogue between two people working to understand each other better, but it hits like a voice note from a partner who still wants to fight for the relationship but is increasingly resentful of all the work it’s taking. By contrast, British singer-songwriter RAYE takes command on “Paralyzed,” laying the stakes for a truly transformative love: “Intuition says, ‘Run for the door, save yourself’/But to leave both you and my heart in this room, I would’ve played myself.” Begging is all well and good, but relationships demand the courage to act.",Pop,7.3
160,"Lou Barlow and John H. Davis’ first body of new work in 25 years applies a fresh coat of paint to the droning indie rock sound of the duo’s formative years. The Folk Implosion certainly wasn’t the first 1990s indie rock act to tinker with the sample-based structures of hip-hop, but their approach to genre fusion may have been the most prescient. “Natural One,” the duo’s unlikely Billboard-charting hit and best-known contribution to Larry Clark’s Kids soundtrack, was a reaction to recently released major label debuts by Portishead and Beck, translating the group’s usual plunking bedroom recordings into a beat-driven context while consciously avoiding the sardonic tone of a track like “Loser.” As Lou Barlow and John H. Davis grew into their new sound, their experimentation became increasingly distinct, particularly on their last album, 1999’s One Part Lullaby, which fully realized their blend of glitched-out electronic composition, gritty drum breaks, and whispery emo pop. From a contemporary perspective, the album’s title cut and the vocoder-infused “E.Z. L.A.” feel like an embryonic version of recent work by brakence or Jane Remover: intimate, yet futuristic in equal measure.Following the release of 2023’s Music for KIDS compilation—a retrospective look behind the scenes of the soundtrack sessions that inspired the Folk Implosion’s embrace of electronica—Barlow and Davis have returned with their first body of new work in 25 years. Walk Thru Me, written remotely before the pair hit the studio with producer Scott Solter, is a return to the group’s roots as penpals. They’ve also largely abandoned their hip-hop influences, dusting off the droning indie rock sound of the band’s formative years and giving it a fresh coat of paint. While early Folk Implosion outings like Take a Look Inside and Palm of My Hand were patchwork affairs comprised of crunchy thrash, stoned jam sessions and bite-sized lo-fi pop gems, Walk Thru Me lacks their mercurial mystique. Davis, who is currently studying Persian music, incorporates stringed Middle Eastern instruments like setar, oud, and saz into his songwriting, though he and Barlow stick to a familiar formula throughout, noodling and down-stroking over leisurely, mid-tempo drum patterns. Without the Folk Implosion’s typically unpredictable energy, the duo’s knack for conjuring surreal harmonic atmospheres is dampened by boilerplate beats and song structure.The shift toward more polished, fleshed-out songcraft finds greater success on the lyrical front. On “My Little Lamb,” Barlow grapples with his approach to parenting, weighing his protective instincts against the wisdom that “they’ve gotta wonder on their own.” With a conversational cadence that recalls Jad Fair, Davis’ turns at the mic are painstaking snapshots of adult ennui, describing the numbing effects of robocalls and televised sports on “Bobblehead Dolls,” and trying to put himself in the neurological headspace of his late father on “The Day You Died.” Earlier Folk Implosion material reveled in abstract expression, balling up scribbled pages of adolescent catharsis on songs like “Daddy Never Understood” or “Mood Swing” and chucking them into oblivion. The fragmented lyricism suited the dashed-off, DIY quality of Barlow and Davis’ mid-’90s output, but here their angst translates to full storytelling quite naturally.",Experimental,6.4
161,"Lupe Fiasco reunites with producer Soundtrakk for a jazzy, subdued album that weighs the challenges and indignities of sustaining a career in the arts. Toward the end of The Last Samurai, Helen DeWitt’s 2000 novel about a single mother and son bouncing around the poverty line as the latter searches for a suitable father figure, that son has a conversation with a brilliant but difficult pianist. “Why don’t you make a CD?” the son asks. The pianist replies: “No one would buy the kind of thing I’d like to put on a CD and I can’t afford to make a CD that no one will buy.” The Last Samurai is hailed by critics and sold well over 100,000 copies. But due to contract math that would make Q-Tip blush, DeWitt ended up owing her publisher money. Before long, the book fell out of print. In the decades since, DeWitt’s fiction has focused on the material lives of artists as they struggle to navigate capitalism and psychological collapse.Once an ascendant pop star and critical darling with a seemingly clean trajectory, Lupe Fiasco has seen his career has grow similarly tangled in the last 15 years. Since the public feud between him and his former label, Atlantic, over his third album, 2011’s Lasers, Lupe has remained nearly A-list by reputation, but with plummeting chart positions that suggest an audience segmented from the rap mainstream. He’s spoken frequently and eloquently about not only the business minutiae that has complicated his decision-making, but the ways hip-hop—and music writ large—is devalued compared to so-called fine art. (“If I want to read the next book by Helen DeWitt, I can just write it, and read it, and then write another one,” the Last Samurai author The Believer in 2012. “Painters do that and nobody objects.”)Samurai, which arrives almost two years to the day after Lupe’s eighth album, Drill Music in Zion, has plenty in common with that project: It’s produced entirely by longtime collaborator Soundtrakk, skews jazzy and subdued, and is slight (even slighter, in fact, at just 30 minutes). Its title was inspired by a moment in Asif Kapadia’s 2015 Amy Winehouse documentary in which the late singer leaves a voice message for producer Salaam Remi describing herself as a samurai battle rapper. For Lupe, the metaphor seems tidy: a motivated master working in relative isolation, honing a blade.The album is conspicuously breezy. Lupe’s singing voice, a staple of his style as far back as The Cool, has only grown more pliable: See the way he moves between cadences and harmonies on the hook and verses of “Palaces,” each smartly shaped and carefully rendered. Elsewhere he flits, without apparent effort, between other modes of technical wizardry, like the staccato syllable latticework that dresses up pedestrian writing on the second verse of “No. 1 Headband” or the passage on “Mumble Rap” that begins with the line, “With a style similar to riding around looking for an arrest to resist.” It feels as if there’s some great, centrifugal force pushing down on the middle of each bar.And yet this musical ease seems at deliberate odds with the torture Lupe describes, in first- and third-person, of trying to hack a career in the arts. There are the shows where the “front row the only row” (“Bigfoot”); there is the line on “Outside” where he says, “My business bone is connected to my ethics”—defiant from one angle, quixotic from another. Lupe lapses in and out of Amy Winehouse portraiture, and when he raps, on closer “Til Eternity,” about a beehive that “survived in a wreck,” it’s both a reference to her signature hairstyle and a metaphor that echos the ones he introduces earlier on the album. “We think we’re fortresses, made of stone,” he croons on “Palaces,” “but we’re just palaces made out of flesh and bone.” Despite the loftiness of “palace,” he presents this fragility without romance—or at least, with full knowledge of the forces conspiring to puncture it at every pass.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

162,"The 24-year-old Providence musician’s 15th album bursts with imagination, complexity, and feeling. The abundance of ideas might seem excessive if it weren’t so carefully arranged. A few details to get out of the way up front. Home Constellation Study is Asher White’s 15th album, though the actual number of releases on her Bandcamp, which includes various side projects and non-album collections, is 26. The earliest of these, a ghostly collage of feedback and field recordings of Icelandic landscapes, came out when the Providence musician was 14 years old. She is now 24.White’s prodigious early years may help to explain the accomplishment and imagination of Home Constellation Study, an album whose abundance of ideas might seem excessive if it weren’t so carefully arranged. One song sounds like Radiohead with periodic interruptions from Lightning Bolt, another like Burt Bacharach by way of Jim O’Rourke, a third like a Gamble & Huff symphonic soul epic downsized to the scale of a basement rehearsal room. A partial list of instruments that White played includes guitar, bass, drums, banjo, glockenspiel, granular synthesis, piano, and “fake mellotron”—nearly everything on the album, save for some horns and additional electronics.White clearly loves pop and outré music from many eras. The period that Home Constellation Study most directly recalls is the one just before she started uploading her work: the mid-to-late 2000s, a time when indie rock held accessibility and experimentation in delicate balance, when a bruising noise-rock band might share a bill with a psych-folk collective that seemed sort of like a cult, when DIY scenes had just enough attention to feed bands’ ambition—but not yet so much that they crumbled under the pressure or cleaned up their acts and signed to majors. And though White wrote and recorded Home Constellation Study primarily by herself, it feels distinctly social, in an embodied, in-person, perhaps old-fashioned sort of way. So much music from young songwriters and producers now evokes the solitary overstimulation and context collapse of hours spent online. White’s feels more like hitting the road with a friend, making impromptu stops, laughing together, getting into arguments whose stakes are not hidden behind screens, then talking it out and hitting the road again.Home Constellation Study begins in transit, with “Theme From Leaving Philadelphia,” a travelogue that a less adventurous arranger might have set to simple acoustic guitar or piano, for maximum directness and authenticity. Instead, White opts for sounds that reflect the wonder and frenzy of her departure. First, there is a fanfare of horns, voices, and maybe fake mellotron that recalls Aaron Copland’s hymns to the American spirit more than it does indie rock. Then the drums come in with a groove like a runaway train. There’s an acoustic guitar somewhere deep in the mix, strumming so hard and fast I can’t help but worry about carpal tunnel. Asa Turok’s trombone and Addy Schuetz’s sax bob and weave, sometimes offering lyrical countermelodies and sometimes terse punctuation. Cowbells clang like only cowbells can. White sings as if at a comfortable remove from the frenzy, tracing exuberant spirals of melody, unbothered by the rushing noise on the other side of the train window. The rhythms of the words neatly fit the hairpin turns of the tune; impressions of inner feeling and outer landscape begin to blur in her imagistic lyrics. One line returns persistently, nagging as it might have nagged the hungover passenger as she wrote: “I am still drunk!”",Rock,8.0
163,"The rap trio meditates on the passage of time on their new LP. It possesses all the intimacy and nostalgia of a ’90s parking lot cypher between friends. One day, you’ll wake up aching for some undefined reason, perhaps a little hungover from the one glass of wine you had with dinner, and solemnly think to yourself, “Fuck, I’m old.” There is new stiffness in your hips from standing too long in less-than-sensible shoes, or driving around town and pointing out that a new business used to be a different one. Aging is weird and often painful, but it’s also fascinating, even hilarious. The years speed up exponentially until months pass in a blink, the time between sunrise and sunset shrinking down to nothing.Open Mike Eagle, Video Dave, and STILL RIFT feel the passage of time in their bones. The Los Angeles via Chicago emcees who make up the new trio Previous Industries named their debut after a retail catalog that went bankrupt in 1999. Thumbing through it provided a specific kind of dopamine rush now lost to the ages. References to it abound throughout Service Merchandise—“I would not feel sad at all/If I could buy everything in the catalog,” sings Video Dave during the chorus of “Roebuck.” Most of the songs bear the name of a store you’d see in every mall in the United States before they became sad ghost towns, air conditioning and smooth jazz blasting in the emptied, echoing caverns of capitalism. But this isn’t just an album about how Gen Xers and elder millennials get misty-eyed when they think about Blockbuster. The trio uses nostalgia as a tool of examination, ruminating on the not-too-distant past in order to process the funny and sometimes heartbreaking process of getting older together.The three rappers have such effortless chemistry that it’s hard to believe that Service Merchandise is their first group outing. They’ve been in each other’s orbit for a lifetime: Eagle and RIFT (originally Rift Napalm) met at Whitney M. Young Magnet High School, forming the group PDX with fellow Chicago rapper Psalm One, which eventually absorbed into the legendary Nacrobats crew. Video Dave and Eagle first met in college at Southern Illinois University, forging a friendship and artistic bond that led to many collaborations and tours together (including work on Eagle’s TV series The New Negroes). During the pandemic lockdown, the three would gather at Eagle’s apartment for whiskey-fueled gaming and recording sessions, eventually compiling what would become Service Merchandise.The album doesn’t stray too far from the hazy, inviting sound Eagle has mined for his last couple of releases. There’s a focus on street corner battle-tested rapping, the kind that places emphasis on the malleability of language and construction of unexpected wordplay; you can easily imagine them in a semi-circle, bobbing along to the beat, jumping in when it feels natural. Kenny Segal’s mixing keeps the vocals up front and mostly dry, giving the songs an immediate, inner monologue intimacy.",Rap,7.8
164,"The eternally youthful McDonald brothers celebrate their band’s 45th anniversary with a signature blend of pristine melodic craft and garage-band insolence. If there’s one thing Redd Kross are famous for, it’s having famous fans. Years before Sonic Youth made Madonna their own, brothers Jeff and Steve McDonald were showing Kim and Thurston how pop culture pin-ups could be reframed as punk iconography. They got Sofia Coppola to pose nude on an album cover and inspired her brother Roman to essentially build a feature film around their kitschy ’70s style. They illuminated the path for Stone Temple Pilots to move beyond mosh-pit machismo toward glammy swagger. They reissued their ’90s catalog through Jack White’s Third Man imprint. And Jeff married a Go-Go. There is, however, one notable alt-rock star who resisted Redd Kross’ charm offensive.You’d think Redd Kross would’ve been right up Kurt Cobain’s alley: Both he and the McDonalds came of age with record collections where the Beatles were filed next to Black Flag, and both were charter members of the American Shonen Knife fan club. But according to mutual friend Dale Crover (the one guy who’s drummed for both Nirvana and Redd Kross), an unimpressed Cobain walked away from a 1987 Redd Kross gig in Tacoma complaining that the McDonalds seemed “too happy.” After seeing Crover tell that story in an early cut of director Andrew Reich’s new Redd Kross documentary, Born Innocent, Steve McDonald wrote “Way Too Happy,” a bittersweet power-pop number that appears deep into Redd Kross’ new self-titled double album. “What did he mean?” Steve asks with audibly wounded pride, before responding with an uncannily Cobain-esque sneer, as if he were still being taunted from beyond the grave. But the McDonalds aren’t looking to reheat old beef—rather, “Way Too Happy” serves as a renewed mission statement for a band that has always embraced joy as its superpower.As indie rock’s original poptimists, Redd Kross elevated fandom to an artform, imagining a world where ABBA and the Partridge Family could be placed on equal footing with Germs and the Stooges. But after decades of plundering rock’n’roll’s past like a thrift-store discount rack, Redd Kross are now fixing their retro-gazing lens on themselves. Redd Kross is part of a 45th-anniversary celebration campaign that includes Reich’s documentary and an upcoming memoir (Now You’re One of Us), and it’s a self-reflexive exercise in every way, from the cover art (a ruby-tinged makeover of the Beatles’ White Album, the first record Jeff bought as a kid) to the uncharacteristically wistful, introspective songwriting. But seeing as Redd Kross are the rare band who can celebrate 45 years in showbiz while one founding member is still in their 50s, the eternally youthful McDonalds are still committed to chasing new glories. They may no longer resemble the androgynous provocateurs of old, but their pop savvy remains.",Rock,7.8
165,"With Ernest Green’s pastoral Georgia home as its emotional backdrop, Washed Out’s fifth LP clears the haze from his structured songcraft and winds up feeling inert. Forgive Ernest Greene his absence; he’s been gettin’ busy living. The Facebook post announcing Notes From a Quiet Life—the fifth Washed Out LP, and first in four years—closed with “welcome to Endymion.” It’s a reference to the 20-acre, Macon-area horse farm he purchased in 2021 and converted into a combination homestead and artists’ estate. The property is central to the album’s promotion: An illustration of a ranch house adorns Sub Pop’s press release, which is mocked up to resemble mid-century letterhead. Last month, Greene posted a short film (also titled Notes From a Quiet Life) about his day-to-day at Endymion: changing diapers in the magic hour, exploring the woods, tending to his mindfully arranged spheres. Washed Out appears as chillwave personified: a Southern-fried bedroom musician, beating an emotional and sonic retreat to the past in the face of an austerity-wracked present. Endymion feels like the future that Greene’s cohort was sold.How curious that none of this made it to the record. Despite the fingerpicking depicted in the film, this isn’t Washed Out’s For Emma, Forever Ago, or even a folktronica turn. This time, he actively avoids musical influences. Visual artists, primarily sculptors, were Greene’s inspiration: Barbara Hepworth, Donald Judd, Henry Moore. Those are the leftfield citations of a noise musician or an ECM jazz composer, and an acknowledgment that Greene, too, is refining his own well-recognized forms. The life may be quiet, but the notes seem cribbed: The easiest way to describe this record is 2020’s Purple Noon with the fog burned off. “A Sign” snaps the dissolute lovers rock of Purple Noon’s “Paralyzed” to the grid. The fluttering, fatalistic closer “Letting Go” is a modal cousin to the Balearic reggae of “Time to Walk Away” (to say nothing of Chris Isaak’s transcendentally simpering “Wicked Game”). Where “Reckless Desires” used rhythmic koto figures to remain aloft, “Second Sight” is content to deploy the instrument as a vaporwave glissando.Notes From a Quiet Life is, somewhat surprisingly, the first Washed Out album Greene has produced alone. Perhaps he cleared the haze in order to better reveal the classical structure of his songwriting. The results sound great: punchy snares and widemouth synth bass. And to an unprecedented degree, his voice—a careful baritone that recalls Beck at his most plaintive—occupies a large part of the space. He brings a stateliness to the expected places: the tender “Got Your Back,” with its wordless lullaby of a hook, and the twinkling “Wondrous Life,” which nearly topples into power balladry. But it’s also present on the dissolute lovers rock of “A Sign,” a crush song that generates its heat from overthinking (“But I think I’m falling hard/Am I taking this too far?”) instead of attraction. “Say Goodbye” is a slow strut of a breakup song, so assuring and frictionless it’s like being sent home in a hovercar.",Electronic,6.0
166,"Stretching out keys, piano, and pedal steel in wide-open space, the ambient country trio’s new album underlines the vast scale of evolutionary time. SUSS evoke the blistering days and chilly nights of an American desert. Their take on “ambient country,” a term they apparently coined, is elegant, luxurious, and teeming with technology—less like actually living in the Mojave than watching a time-lapse of the sky dappling its mesas and buttes. The New York trio leans hard into these imagined environs: A 2022 self-titled album featured songs titled “Gallup, NM” and “Needles, CA,” communities along Route 66 that the group’s members knew mostly from the vantage of the tour van. If the cowboy shtick sounds like cosplay, it disguises an equally prominent Downtown sensibility: SUSS, once a quartet with synth wizard Gary Leib before his unexpected death in 2021, weave their sound with a legacy of improvisation that has as much to do with the genre experiments of the Kitchen and the ’90s Knitting Factory as, say, the Grand Ole Opry. The potentially straw-thin gimmickry of “ambient country” is a vessel for urban yearnings, daydreams of pastoral life conjured up in the confinement of the metropolis.It helps that the band, which now comprises pedal steel player Jonathan Gregg and multi-instrumentalists Bob Holmes and Pat Irwin (onetime guitarist for the B-52’s), emerged during the final years of the last decade, both an efflorescent period for ambient music and a moment when country was becoming more palatable to a wider variety of listeners. SUSS highlight a big-sky sweep that informed the former genre throughout its history: Pedal steel set a tone on Brian Eno’s scene-defining 1983 record Apollo, resurfaced on the KLF’s 1990 game-changer Chill Out, and took centerstage on Bruce Kaphan’s underknown 2001 record Slider, a focal point for the seemingly walleyed convergence of new age and Americana. SUSS’s 2018 debut, Ghost Box, may not have forged an original style, but it drew a bright red circle around ambient aesthetics that had always hidden in plain sight. Sometimes, putting a name to the unnameable is what innovation is all about.Their new album, Birds & Beasts, takes the time-lapse metaphor to its extreme. The record seems to deal in eons, in the slow progression of ecology—the movements of fauna and the death and rebirth of flora. One can feel millennia pass in this record. The songs are wordless, aside from some muffled speech samples, so the only clues to their themes are SUSS’ highly suggestive song titles—“Migration,” for example, or “Overstory,” which brings to mind a verdant, thick canopy in a part of the world that has since become dusty and arid. (Not to mention novelist Richard Powers’ 2018 lament for the death of trees.) Many of the tunes are based around sighing keys, piano, and pedal steel, but “Restless” and “Flight” forefront finger-picked guitar rhythms, the sound of a small animal scurrying across a huge landscape.",Experimental,7.8
167,"On its first album in 12 years, the veteran instrumental trio discovers a newfound spontaneity, summoning some of the most beautiful and emotional work of the group’s career. At their best, Dirty Three can sound like they might fall apart in an instant. Listen to the way “Ember,” from 2005’s expansive Cinder, seems forever to wobble, as if Warren Ellis’ violin were about to stumble into the canyon created by Jim White’s loping drums. Or ponder how Ellis and guitarist Mick Turner skirt the void while upbraiding their strings during “Red,” from 1996’s breakthrough Horse Stories. An unusually expressive instrumental trio, these three longtime Melbourne chums have always used the tension between their respective playing to foster collective feelings of annoyance or ecstasy, boredom or wonder, anxiety or amusement. In doing so, they have often suggested some ornate mobile hanging from an art museum’s ceiling, its three bejeweled pieces bound together only by rusted wire, perpetually at risk of clattering to the ground. The thrill has been hearing them hold it together.On Love Changes Everything, Dirty Three’s first album in a dozen years, those corroded wires finally snap, leaving the pieces to smash to the floor and reorient themselves in new relationships. And they do: Ellis, White, and Turner have never sounded so alternately tight and loose, so unified and amorphous, capturing an emotional ambiguity that drifts between hope and despair. Forgoing their usual evocative song titles in favor of a suite of numbered pieces that often flow into and out of one another, Dirty Three have made not only their most absorbing album but also the one that’s most open to interpretation. It is a convincing case study in how a veteran band, each member now nearing or beyond 60, can evolve—letting go, once and for all, of preconceptions and self-perceptions and simply meeting where they are.Dirty Three emerged in the early ’90s from exuberant youthful squalor, playing long hours in Australian bars for crowds that found them perplexing or polarizing. But international attention, especially in the United States, became their passport. They toured doggedly and collaborated promiscuously. White and Turner joined Cat Power for 1998’s Moon Pix. Ellis partnered with another expat, Nick Cave, in a prolific ongoing relationship. As the years passed, Dirty Three themselves became more focused, as if the band were a repository for a specific subset of sounds and ideas for musicians who were otherwise busy doing lots of things—painting and making exquisite solo records, playing with Bill Callahan and dozens of others, becoming a score-writing Bad Seed.",Rock,8.0
168,"Following her Drive My Car soundtrack, the Japanese composer again links up with director Ryusuke Hamaguchi; this time, her ambiguous, atmospheric pieces are even more central to the narrative. Eiko Ishibashi and director Ryusuke Hamaguchi both revel in the unresolved. Ishibashi’s music has flitted between toy-box art punk, wide-open free jazz, zig-zagging classical piano, and dreamy industrialism, arriving now at a tense, quietly graceful form of musique concréte in which it’s never obvious what’s coming next. Hamaguchi, meanwhile, has steadily built a body of work delving into the quotidian unknown; the most mundane moments in his films hide the possibility for strange twists, vulnerable revelations, and open-hearted catharsis. Ishibashi’s soundtrack for Hamaguchi’s acclaimed 2021 film Drive My Car not only offered a sweet, sighing counterbalance to the film’s winding search for closure, but also delivered some of Ishibashi’s downright prettiest music yet. It was so successful that the two have teamed up once again, this time for a project of a very different nature.Ishibashi wrote the Drive My Car score based on visuals sent to her by Hamaguchi, along with reference points (a theme song in the vein of Henry Mancini; music that sounds “like a landscape,” she told Variety). But Evil Does Not Exist took shape more holistically. The project began when Ishibashi asked Hamaguchi for imagery to accompany a new live performance she was working on, to be titled Gift. After a visit to her studio a few hours outside Tokyo—where, amid the tranquil surroundings, the two discussed the relationship between cities and nature—Hamaguchi began writing a story about a small rural community that becomes disturbed when a glamping company moves in and threatens to contaminate their water supply. Hamaguchi ended up shooting an entire film around the narrative, and in turn, Ishibashi fleshed out her music to match it.Evil Does Not Exist isn’t a plot-heavy film; as the glamping resort plans how to set up shop in the village, Ishibashi’s music—the secret heart of the story—navigates the uneasy balance between the peacefully snow-covered countryside and the awkward cityfolk trying to interject themselves into its ecosystem. On “Hana V.2,” murky electronic tones bubble like pockets of air in pitch-black tar. Every time the track seems to settle, something interrupts, like lush washes of strings or a sharp piercing tone that returns again and again. “[Ishibashi] doesn't allow you to feel safe while you're listening to her music,” Hamaguchi recently told the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, describing how the composer’s music “seems to continuously develop without ever becoming conclusive.” This constant feeling of being on edge suits Hamaguchi’s own muted, close-to-the-chest rhythms.",Pop,7.5
169,"The Texas rap star’s new album has something for every type of Megan Thee Stallion fan—and the strain of catering to the masses has begun to crowd out the goofy charm of her best music. It is hard to overstate Megan Thee Stallion’s success: She is not just a rap star, but the kind of supercharged celebrity who appears in commercials and movies and hobnobs with pop stars, all while serving as the new flagbearer of Houston rap heritage. On MEGAN, her newest album, you can feel the pressure on her to keep all those plates spinning—to maintain momentum, to not fuck it up. After Tina Snow, the 2018 EP that cemented Megan as a rapper who’s as raunchy, funny, and charismatic as anyone, all of her full-length projects have, to varying degrees, felt like exercises in becoming everything to everyone. But it’s never been as distracting as it is on MEGAN, an uneven album so preoccupied with giving every single type of fan exactly what they want that it might as well be crowdsourced.Do you share Megan’s infatuation with anime? Then you will get a thrill out of “Otaku Hot Girl,” which samples a song from Jujutsu Kaisen and features an intro from one of the show’s voice actors. Bankroll Got It’s drum-heavy flip of the soundtrack is uninteresting—though it’s not like he’s working with an anime renowned for its music—and the character references are earnest but unbearably corny. The better song that leans into her fondness for Japanese culture is the multilingual “Mamushi,” which pulls off the theme without flattening her personality. Maybe instead you need new Megan to play at your Pilates class: She’s got you with the feel-good “Worthy,” a Lizzo-coded pop song. Those muscles are put to more effective use on “Spin,” where the silky Victoria Monét hook complements aggressively flirty Megan verses. The fluffy finger-snap beat sounds like it could have been on Love/Hate. (Come to think of it, Megan would have ripped “Shawty Is Da Shit.”)Then there are the songs for those deeply invested in Megan’s beefs and squabbles. I can picture fans gathering in group chats, dissecting subliminals and clues like they’re in an Agatha Christie book club. After the last three months, I’m all feuded out, so I’m less interested in that game. Still, she lands a few good jokes on “Hiss,” where she calls out the misogynistic dudes in rap who can’t keep her name out of their mouths. (Drake has had a one-sided vendetta toward her for a while now; Megan hits back with some BBL Drizzy theories of her own.) “Rattle,” which has a fast, groovy beat that melodic South Florida rappers would eat up, leaves a sting. “’Cause the niggas don’t beef with the niggas/They scared of each other, but beat on the women,” she attacks; she could be talking about a dozen different rappers, which makes the song feel like a sharp indictment of hip-hop culture in general. As critical as that line is, she still has fun chanting, “Ain’t got no tea on me, this ho’ think she TMZ” while hitting a Harley Quinn cackle in the background.",Rap,6.6
170,"The Bay Area band’s two singer-guitarists have been friends since they were teens. On a debut album shot through with grief and tenderness, that intimacy fuels an almost telepathic interplay. Catharsis does not always come quickly in a Sour Widows song, but when it does, it hits like a lightning strike. On early singles and EPs, musicians Maia Sinaiko and Susanna Thomson intermingled their voices and guitar melodies while dreamy soundscapes sprawled into extended vamps, holding tight to both tension and tenderness. The Bay Area band has honed its process on its debut full-length, Revival of a Friend—an album filled with patient, gracious songs that unfold with careful momentum and deep emotion.Revival of a Friend is shaped by grief: Both Sinaiko and Thomson faced significant loss in the years since starting the band, and those experiences are embedded in their songwriting. The dynamic “I-90” pays tribute to a partner Sinaiko lost to an accidental overdose, filtering sweet, quotidian memories through the retrospective lens of sorrow. “Initiation,” too, is a song of mourning, written after the 2021 death of Thomson’s mother; its imagery is striking, combining the sacred and visceral in lyrics that sing of “Heaven spilling at the steppe/Stardust in the cup of my hand.”Many of these songs depict a narrator reaching out for connection, grasping for something just beyond their grasp: “Fuck everything I did/To feel good for a moment,” goes the opening of “Cherish,” which eventually comes around to a pleading note: “Will you love me through this?” But beneath the desperation and severed connections lies the sound of musicians who are deeply attuned to each other. Sinaiko and Thomson are longtime friends who first met as teenagers and have written songs together ever since. You can hear their intimacy in the way they play and sing together—guitar melodies that snake and vine around each other; vocal harmonies where each voice complements the other with richness and depth. Drummer Max Edelman joined the band after Sinaiko and Thomson’s very first show as a duo, and his playing—along with bassist Timmy Stabler—ranges from delicate to thunderous, forming a deft backbone for the songs’ ebbs and flows.Several songs shift seamlessly into instrumental interludes—like the spacey, slowcore-indebted “Revival,” which follows opener “Big Dogs,” or the gently rolling “Gold Thread,” which extends and explores musical themes introduced in “Initiation.” These blood-pressure-lowering respites make the album’s moments of breakthrough hit even harder. “Witness,” also written in the wake of Thomson’s mother’s death, has a roller coaster’s momentum: When a tight rhythm and strummed chords in the verse give way to a more elastic beat and gracefully ambling guitar lines, it feels like a fist unclenching. Later, a similar musical build erupts into full-on release; the whole band is propelled powerfully forward by the heaviness of loss, a “feeling” that “would kill you,” as Sinaiko and Thomson shout. When the song downshifts and sways into its final moments, the effect is dizzying.",Rock,7.6
171,"The duo’s joint project is wistful and occasionally danceable, juxtaposing steely electronica with a stadium-ready take on Yachty’s sing-rap sensibilities. But too often, they play it safe. When James Blake and Lil Yachty debuted as divisive wunderkinds, they earned feverish acclaim—and controversy—for the way they blurred the lines etched by their predecessors. Blake stormed dubstep’s dancefloor and rendered it a dusty confessional booth; Yachty looked at the hip-hop landscape he inherited, cursed its gods, and spent the beginning of his career at war with a generation. Not everything has changed: They’re still divisive, and they’re still doggedly trying new things. But they aren’t upstarts anymore; nor are their disruptive ideas breaking boundaries so much as reinforcing them. (So long, saxophones, and so long, rap.) A pair that once embodied youthful iconoclasm now often seem to see only as far as their next grievance. More and more, they sound like the gatekeepers who didn’t believe in them years ago.Thus the defensive crossover spectacle of Bad Cameo, their new joint album. Few things announce themselves louder than a tag-team LP by a polarizing producer and an equally polarizing rapper-turned-rocker. But instead of provoking, this record largely takes the low-key road, like a terse postscript to a more transgressive past. It’s dreamy and occasionally danceable, steely electronica rubbing shoulders with a sharp, stadium-ready take on Yachty’s sing-rap sensibilities. The shoulder-rubbing is promising, but at a certain point, when the friction hasn’t progressed any further, the party starts to feel like a corporate lunch: Hey Post-Dubstep, have you met Post-Trap? I’ll leave you two alone to hit it off! Sometimes, they do. More often, Blake and Yachty are cozy in their respective corners, taking turns in the spotlight rather than sharing it. You get the sense that they’re trying to rekindle old magic—the wonders Blake worked with his glitchy soul-searching, the weightlessness Yachty proffered with his pitch-shifted lilts. These elements sound nice next to one another. They’d sound even better if they did more than just coexist.When Yachty released “Poland,” his unlikely 2022 hit single, part of the draw was his quivering, liquid delivery: “It is a really fucking weird song,” Blake told him in a recent sit-down, revealing that it brought him to tears. He’s right to identify the weirdness as jolting—at least enough to channel raw emotion, or inspire it in others. But when they try to accomplish this on Bad Cameo, they sound maddeningly riskless. The title track registers like an attempt to run “Poland” through Blake’s chilly alt-pop processing and produce something equally apt for dorm rooms and sound baths. There’s a repeatable mantra, minimal frills that foreground the vocals, and an air of confession—only now, instead of spiking one another’s worlds, the crossover dilutes their respective strengths. “Did you ever love me?” Yachty begs, in full “Poland” voice, with Blake echoing his prayer in the background. You might recall a similar plea on the 2022 song (“Hope you love me, baby, I hope you mean it”). Where “Poland” producer F1lthy supplied Yachty with a jumpy, trap-infused hotbed, Blake’s canvas is restrictive, limiting the singer to a cramped crying closet both have outgrown. Solemn as it sounds, it’s hard to take very seriously.",Rap,6.4
172,"On their lusty new album, the L.A. singer and songwriter leapfrogs across trap-inflected R&B, countryfied ballads, and bassy pop confections. On Kehlani’s last album, 2022’s blue water road, the L.A.-based singer-songwriter dove into the comforts of love via airy guitar pop. It was a slight adjustment to their formula following albums rife with heated R&B and moody atmosphere, a new wrinkle reflecting a maturing sensitivity to tales of love lost and won. On Crash, Kehlani’s fourth studio album, they turn once again, this time toward a grab bag of genres that reflect the dizzying ups and downs of desire and self-examination. While it often sounds like Kehlani is trying on a series of flashy outfits to see which one fits best, it’s still exhilarating when Crash dials up their signature swagger.For Kehlani, the titular crash symbolizes a sudden, brief spike of emotion. The album evokes that intensity through freewheeling music that roves between styles, occasionally within the same song: buoyant dancehall, trap-inflected R&B, and country-tinged ballads are just a few of the flavors Kehlani whips up. Halfway through opener “GrooveTheory,” they switch from girl-group croons to stomping come-ons with the click of a radio dial. “Let’s make a movie/Then come and show me the sequel,” they purr, offering an easy inroad to Crash’s frisky point of view. On the similarly slow-burning “Sucia,” Kehlani gets an assist from Jill Scott, who shows up in sultry spoken-word mode, and Puerto Rican rapper Young Miko, who slides on the song’s beat with slinky ease. It’s a moody highlight that depicts Kehlani in the depths of lust: “I don’t want Miami, I want Medellín/Take you from the party to the trampoline,” they urge.That focus on desire courses throughout most of Crash, lending its best songs a flirty levity. On “What I Want,” Kehlani threads a chip-tuned Christina Aguilera sample with trap hi-hats and thundering bass, giving it a darkened glower that ratchets up the bravado. It’s one of the stronger, more deliberate sample choices on Crash, fresher than much of the nostalgia bait that runs rampant in contemporary pop and R&B. “After Hours” achieves a similar flex, rewiring the riddim popularized by Nina Sky’s classic “Move Ya Body” into a breezy plea for a longer night with a lover; it’s a featherlight, upbeat reinterpretation that doubles as an expert showcase for Kehlani’s vocals, which across Crash sound more syrupy and relaxed than ever.When Crash slows down, the results are more mixed. On the pared-back ballad “Better Not,” Kehlani reaches for a country-tuned wistfulness that treads too close to faceless folk-rock. “Vegas,” with its keening, ’80s-nodding guitar solos, suffers a similar fate and simultaneously falls into cliched songwriting (“What happens here stays here”) that winds up sounding like a marketing campaign. It’s emblematic of some of Crash’s less imaginative songs, like the “crying in the club” motif that runs through the chorus of the dancehall-tinged, Omah Lay-featuring “Tears.” The lyrics can feel like an afterthought, even when Kehlani’s sheer charisma and honey-smooth delivery makes them go down easy.Kehlani recovers on “Deep,” a highlight that unfurls a spread of bass-heavy psych-rock to take stock of their tumultuous life story. Featuring background vocals from family including their daughter, the song recalls Rihanna’s cathartic, conflicted ANTI, with a careening chorus that rides on Kehlani’s trilling, emotive delivery and heavy, skull-rattling beats. Tracing an arc from sleeping on a concrete floor to present-day success, it’s the kind of sharp, introspective work that colors Kehlani’s best music: a welcome counter to some of Crash’s excesses.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

173,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit the apex of the infamous UK band, a hedonistic and sampledelic Madchester masterpiece that reinvented post-punk for the rave era. The models are dressed for a 1990 music video shoot, but no one seems to have told them it’d be a Happy Mondays video shoot. To be fair, Happy Mondays appear to have no idea that they’re at a Happy Mondays video shoot either. At least a dozen women in tasteful cocktail dresses gyrate in an empty sound studio as Happy Mondays pantomime a song called “Kinky Afro,” wearing what looks like the clothes they slept in the night before.That is, if they slept at all. The first look Shaun Ryder gives to the camera is so far beyond “hungover” that it’s uncanny, like a still from an I Think You Should Leave sketch 30 years ahead of its time. His fly also appears to be halfway down. The only guy in the band that’s playing in sync is Mark “Bez” Berry, the mascot/dancer/occasional percussionist whose main instrument is himself, except when he starts patting Ryder’s back like a bongo after a model steals his maracas. “Kinky Afro” is all quotables, but the most important line is, “What you get is just what you see.” And what you saw in this video is exactly what you got on Pills ‘n’ Thrills and Bellyaches—a Madchester masterpiece that could only come from the scene’s most functionally booted band.“Kinky Afro” isn’t Happy Mondays’ biggest hit or defining song—that would be Pills’ rhymin’ and stealin’ lead single “Step On,” or the epochal Paul Oakenfold remix of “Wrote for Luck,” or “24 Hour Party People,” their sex, drugs, and on-the-dole anthem, and the namesake of an indispensable 2002 Factory Records magical realism biopic. After the tragic death of Ian Curtis at 23 ends the revolutionary post-punk phase of Factory, Happy Mondays appear in the film’s second act as unwitting insurgents, a signing that propels Factory founder Tony Wilson’s nightclub, the Haçienda, from a struggling warehouse venue to the locus of the ecstasy-fueled rave revolution that’s sweeping the UK. By the end of the movie, the Mondays are comic relief; with Factory in dire financial straits, they take a meeting with EMI, announce that they’re “going for a Kentucky [Fried Chicken]” when presented with a vegetable platter, and never come back. When we see them eating from an actual bucket of chicken, it’s a gag based on the open secret that “KFC” was the band’s code word for heroin.However, “Kinky Afro” remains Happy Mondays’ biggest hit in America. It’s central to the legacy of their third album, which was released on Elektra and recorded in Los Angeles because that was where these guys were less likely to get in trouble in 1990. Then again, maybe the famed Capitol Studios was just a proper compromise; if relative sobriety was truly a priority, the Mondays wouldn’t have also floated Amsterdam and Jamaica as options.",Pop,9.5
174,"A set of recently unearthed studio recordings sheds light on the country icon’s remarkable comeback in the early 1990s. When Johnny Cash teamed up with Rick Rubin for 1994’s American Recordings, their partnership launched one of the great final acts in 20th-century American music. Yet such a comeback would have seemed vanishingly unlikely at the dawn of the ’90s. Left without a major label for the first time since 1958, Cash had resigned himself to the ignominious depths of Branson, Missouri, the Ozark town known for tacky theaters housing fading stars from yesteryear. The country icon couldn’t even get that right. His financial backing went belly up prior to the launch of the Johnny Cash Theatre in the summer of 1992. When he did finally play the venue a year later, he was stuck filling in for its new headline attraction: the notorious lounge lizard Wayne Newton.The previously unheard demos on Songwriter, a posthumous new album, shed light on that comeback, a narrative so immutable that it today seems etched in stone. They’re drawn from sessions at Nashville’s LSI Studios, where Cash set up at some point in the early ’90s to record a clutch of newly written songs. John Carter Cash—the only child of Johnny and June Carter Cash—recently discovered the recordings, but the artist’s intentions for them remain unclear. Cash’s decision to record at LSI may have been partially altruistic, as it was the joint property of his stepdaughter Rosie and her then-husband Mike Daniel, and thus an easy way to funnel some funds their way. It’s also possible that the demos were meant to persuade another label to sign the country veteran—a goal that was met by other means once Cash met Rubin in 1993.Two of the tunes on Songwriter, “Drive On” and “Like a Soldier,” also appear on American Recordings, and their simultaneous presence illuminates the distance between the two projects. They’re two of the lighter moments on the spare, stoic American Recordings and two of the weightier songs on Songwriter, a record that finds plenty of room for Cash’s humor and sentimentality, character traits Rubin staunchly avoided. The two qualities combine on “I Love You Tonite,” a love letter to June Carter Cash in which he marvels that they’ve made it through the decades and wonders if they’ll last until the new millennium.Some big concerns nag at Cash—he ponders the fate of the planet on “Hello Out There”—yet he generally spends Songwriter operating at a smaller scale, penning character sketches of single mothers sustained by their love of James Taylor, flirting with a woman at the laundromat (“Well Alright”), and writing an ode to all the pretty girls from Little Rock. There’s no sense of foreboding here; it’s as light and rambling as any of the LPs he cut during his waning days at Columbia in the early 1980s or the unjustly maligned Mercury platters from later that decade.",Folk,6.5
175,"The pop star’s fourth LP is a transitional record mistakenly labeled as a statement album. Her impressionistic tale of lost love and aimless youth is electrifying but inconsistent. Much of the excitement in mainstream pop these days falls left of center. Chappell Roan took us all to theater camp; Charli XCX painted the club green with Brat. It’s only too easy to view Camila Cabello’s recent reboot as the work of a music establishment clumsily shifting gears to follow in their wake. The outsized response sparked by C,XOXO’s lead single “I Luv It” was split between excitement over a radical new musical direction and eye-rolling over what initially seemed like one of the most cynical pop rebrands in recent memory (at least until we figure out what is going on with Katy Perry).It’s too bad, because if there was ever an artist more primed for casting off an old self and giving into some effortless partying, Cabello would be the woman. Until now, her music has been incredibly dutiful, whether owing to the demands of a career in Fifth Harmony or the loving reverence for her musical heritage that shaped her three prior solo albums. Though it bears her signature, C,XOXO is a transitional record mistakenly labeled as a statement album. It’s a bridge away from girl-group polish and Latin-inflected pop and toward a more dreamy and reckless club sound. It is not a full pivot to hyperpop, as “I Luv It” suggested, but more like a stab at the wistful, complex, dancefloor introversion practiced by the likes of Lorde, Kelela, Troye Sivan, Frank Ocean, and Rosalía. It’s an evolution that squares nicely with Cabello’s stated ambition to be thought of not simply as a performer but as a writer, the author of a more complex and explicitly adult narrative than she’s told before.C,XOXO is a broadly sketched tale of returning home to Miami and gaining perspective on broken love and aimless youth. It’s heavy on vibes, evoking the 305 primarily through features, some voice memos, and a toothless Spring Breakers aesthetic that’s notably neither trashy nor violent. Yet the musical landscape that Cabello’s producers El Guincho and Jasper Harris conjure is incredibly vivid, wielding warm synths and babbling samples as slinky launch pads for scorching riffs on Afrobeat and reggaeton. Halfway through the fantastic “Dade County Dreaming”—which doubles as a likely swan song for City Girls—JT’s ass-shaking chant is gradually subsumed by an absolutely tidal piano churn as their swagger gives way to a dreamy instrumental vastness. It’s as if Cabello is accessing a new mental horizon in real time.",Pop,6.9
176,"The Ghanaian American singer’s new EP bubbles and froths with Afropop effervescence. It’s a little more subdued than its predecessor, but no less fluid. Amaarae songs have the icy glamor of luxury photography, but none of the stillness. Guided by her fluid coos, the Ghanaian American singer’s restless Afropop constantly flows and bubbles, liquid and frothy as seafoam. On last year’s globetrotting Fountain Baby, she played a Dionysian priestess, extolling the wonders of pussy and premium goods over beats that bridged Accra, Virginia Beach, and Hokkaido. A line from “Angels in Tibet” captures her constant pairing of opulence and exertion: “Diamonds hit the sweat.” In Amaarae’s music, even the jewels get wet.The follow-up EP, roses are red, tears are blue — A Fountain Baby Extended Play, is just as soaked and luxurious, though the mood is more subdued. The lyrics aren’t as manic; the songs don’t erupt into mall punk and dream pop; and the samples aren’t as eclectic, but an Amaarae after-party is still a romp. She continues to twist her lithe voice into sensuous and alien shapes, her indelible coolness always stemming from her boundless sense of play. For her, flexing is a love language.The rich production, sourced from core collaborators like KZ Didit and Kyu Steed, blends alté, highlife, R&B, and house. The songs are svelte, but always textured, the airy melodies and swinging polyrhythms layered with strings, horns, and synths. If Fountain Baby was a flying circus, roses is a homecoming parade, grounded but no less colorful. The wistful “wanted” works a slinky vocal sample, breathy harmonies, and pattering drums into a gentle groove. “I’ll be wanted,” Amaarae and OVO signee Naomi Sharon sing with resolve. The affirmation is vulnerable and cocky, fit to be chanted alone or whispered to a rival.Amaarae’s longtime admiration of Young Thug is obvious on this record. She raps in double-time on “jehovah witness,” her verses frequently erupting into giddy ad-libs and yelps. On the triumphant “this!” her slippery melodies burst into squeals of delight. “Thirty carat diamonds on my wrist/And I’m a vigilante/No fit close my case,” she shrieks, her pitch and lyrics channeling the incarcerated rapper. She’s not as chaotic or expressive as Thug, but she shares his conviction that perpetual motion is the ultimate freedom.Of course, sometimes even unbothered playgirls get played. Beneath the splendor and swagger of these songs runs an undercurrent of longing. “Sweetie, darling/Darling, sweetie/Pick up/The phone/And call me when you miss me,” she pleads on the sun-drenched “sweeeet,” like a ghosted lover leaving a voicemail. Pet names and a chippy delivery belie her anxious pining. On “diamonds,” a humid dance cut, gleaming gemstones offer little consolation as a relationship falls apart. “Who’s that you been calling, texting/Shawty, finessing/To love me is a blessing/Guess I never learn my lesson,” she sings with resignation.Heartbreak, joy, and self-assurance converge on highlight and explicit Jeffery Williams ode “THUG (Truly Humble Under God),” which takes its title from a moment in the ongoing and surreal YSL trial. The ballad is one of the most minimalistic in Amaarae’s catalog; it opens with a sampled prayer for blessings, then builds slowly toward catharsis. She sounds nervous the first time she sings the chorus. “I don’t fold under pressure/I don’t fall under pain/Tomorrow might be better/But I’m looking forward today,” she murmurs into a void of plangent piano and strings. But as the instruments grow bolder and the drums rush in, her voice lifts, and the hook turns exultant, as if she’s breached after a deep dive.The pop experimentalist is always in pursuit of relief in her songs—through sex, through expression, through motion. But here, confidence alone doesn’t guarantee it, a twist that adds new tension to her bustling music. Amaarae sticks to her signature carefree debauchery for most of roses, but she remains a shapeshifter.",Pop,7.8
177,"The Seoul producer and one-half of the electronic group Salamanda makes effervescent, maximalist music. Her new EP is her most dynamic and evocative solo release yet. Taking cues from ambient pioneer Hiroshi Yoshimura and Studio Ghibli filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki, Seoul duo Salamanda conjure vivid fantasy worlds with richly tactile sounds: mallets striking, objects plunking, vocal cords pushing air through pursed lips. Yetsuby, one half of the duo, takes a similarly physical approach to sound in her solo work. But where Salamanda’s music often conveys a sparkling, childlike quality—call it the psychedelia of innocence—Yetsuby’s solo records have often been more chaotic. She twisted up synthetic sounds on 2019’s Heptaprism and leaned toward Two Shell-style overload on last year’s shuddering My Star My Earth. Her new EP, B_B, is her most dynamic and evocative solo release yet. It sounds like a geyser of ball bearings, or a plasticine rainbow, or a marimba the size of a bridge.Both Yetsuby and Salamanda have long displayed ambient leanings, but “Who Swallowed the Chimes at the Random Place,” which opens the EP, is the closest she’s come to crafting something that might be filed within the genre. Softly rounded synth arpeggios bubble expectantly; chimes flicker across the stereo field; jagged streaks of tone occasionally resemble Jon Hassell’s prismatic horn. Still, despite the music’s incidental feel and the absence of drums or melody, the mood is anything but chilled. The moving parts are unpredictable and the placid, new-age tones are offset by metallic bursts and an overarching air of turmoil. The piece belongs to a contemporary strain of hyper-digital music whose organizing principle is gestural in nature, as though Yetsuby had reached into the virtual space of her DAW and smeared the sounds into a shimmery blur.At five minutes long, “Who Swallowed the Chimes” is both the longest and the most formless of the EP’s six tracks. The rest of the record zigzags between streamlined rhythmic studies and maximalist amalgamations of IDM and hyperpop. But no matter the style, a sense of mischief reigns. The brief, percussive “If I Drink This Potion” traipses along at a relatively restrained 112 beats per minute, yet everything seems designed to make it feel faster and more hectic than it is: Drums explode into effervescent clouds, and the downbeat constantly shifts, lending the impression of a frantic jog across liquefying sand. Things settle down on “1,2,3, Soleil,” a 90 BPM head-nodder whose thumping log drums and elastic, dancehall-inspired syncopations could easily pass for a Salamanda track. But Yetsuby can’t resist her habitual impishness: Dappled flute accents soon cede the way to garish splotches of synth, and 32nd-note arps take off like a runaway train, tipping the groove toward singeli’s breakneck gait.",Electronic,7.6
178,"On her new album, the Mexico City-based cellist and singer moves from abstraction toward more familiar pop and rock silhouettes. But her lyrics remain committed to the power of opacity. Mabe Fratti says her music is like looking at yourself in a “really good mirror” and staring at “all the pores in your skin.” Her charmingly idiosyncratic songs seem to caress every small hollow, every laugh line, every curiously located freckle. The Guatemalan-born, Mexico City-based artist thrives on that kind of in-your-face freedom: She twists horns, drums, and cello into angular shapes, shifting between the structures and textures of experimental music, post-rock, jazz, and classical. Sentir que no sabes (Feel Like You Don’t Know), her third album in eight months, is a statement of self-definition—one that encourages you to be at peace with all your insecurities. It’s this propensity to let the irregular feel like second nature that makes Fratti so magnetic. Sentir que no sabes is a summons to make your own rawness a home.On Sentir, Fratti moves closer to the silhouettes of pop and rock than ever before. These songs start to follow more discernible and familiar forms—although she continues to luxuriate in the oblique. “Oídos” begins with jagged, unsettling strings, plinking piano notes landing alongside Fratti’s plangent vocals. A lonely trumpet, played by Jacob Wick and arranged—along with all the album’s drums and strings—by Fratti’s Titanic collaborator Héctor Tosta, blares in the background, twisting into serpentine tendrils. It’s too meandering to be a proper pop song, but still cohesive enough to soundtrack a pensive montage in an art-house film. Lead single “Kravitz,” on the other hand, is full-blown rock, with a grungy bassline and thumping kick drum chugging alongside Fratti’s paranoid lyrics about ears in the ceiling. There are still a couple of jolts, of course: a shrill key; a portentous horn; a trembling vocal performance. Fratti has a gift for creating small dramas like this. She possesses the self-assurance of a viper, slithering through dissonance and harmony without hesitation. This capacious mode looks good on her.On previous releases, it was easy to let Fratti’s words fade into the background—to be moved by a discordant blast of percussion, a spectral melody, or a strummed cello phrase. Fratti has always examined psychic interiors in her lyrics, but Sentir offers more urgent ruminations on the struggle to process emotions, make decisions, and not know what’s next. This often takes the form of self-interrogation. Under a plaintive plucked cello and ethereal, ’80s-inspired keys on “Pantalla azul,” she wonders, “No hay lección más que entender que todo se desordenó/¿Estoy en la razón?/¿Mientras los demás tienen otra historia?/¿Qué hacer con estos pedazos?/Seguir en la espera de un milagro.” Everything is a mess, but maybe it’s alright to feel lost in the pieces that are left behind, waiting for a miracle. In these moments, I feel a kinship between her lyrics and the digressive novels of Clarice Lispector. Like the Brazilian author, Fratti’s writing is sometimes inscrutable, but always self-scrutinous. It plunges into the confounding chaos of the psyche, seeking flashes of wisdom in all the muddle.",Experimental,8.4
179,"EPs have traditionally played a peripheral role in the Chicago group’s catalog, but this six-song release has both the vision and the range of their full-lengths. Wilco have been a lot of things in their 30-year career, but they’ve never been an EP band. Where other acts use the format as a testing ground for new ideas, Wilco always performed their wildest experiments on their studio albums, and Jeff Tweedy has historically favored the LP and the lengthy live set as forums for working through big ideas and worrying over deep uncertainties. Their EPs have almost always been promotional tools, whether it’s their short live set for iTunes or the bonus CDs they’ve appended to proper albums. Even 2003’s More Like the Moon started out as a promo for the Australian edition of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot before it received a standalone release. They’ve been dumping grounds for live cuts and leftovers rather than major statements in and of themselves.Hot Sun Cool Shroud ostensibly serves a similar purpose: Wilco culled tracks from recent sessions and are releasing the EP to coincide with this year’s Solid Sound Festival, where concertgoers will have first dibs on exclusive vinyl before it gets a wider release later this year. But this feels like the first time the band has crafted an EP as a coherent statement with the purpose, if not the weight, of a full LP. There’s an intentionality here that wasn’t present even on More Like the Moon, an embrace of the possibilities of the shorter format. They use the medium surprisingly well, establishing and then elaborating on a “summertime-after-dark” vibe (to use Tweedy’s description). It doesn’t mean much to say Hot Sun is the best EP Wilco have ever made, because there’s not much competition. It means more to say that it feels complete, like a haiku.Opener “Hot Sun” practically melts from the heat, guitar notes bending and warping as Tweedy sings about the physical pleasure of sunlight hitting skin. With that sensation comes a nagging doubt, possibly about climate change: “Shouldn’t I be doing something?” he asks himself. “What can I do? What can I do?” These two oppositional feelings sit in the song as equals, not just as things to experience, but to write about. “What’s the word I want?” Tweedy sings, as though concerned he might not fully convey either the joy or the fear. Few artists can break the fourth wall of a song so eloquently without sounding too clever.With summer as a general theme, Hot Sun is structured in two acts, each side of the 10"" featuring an instrumental bracketed by two vocal-centric tracks. In this setting Wilco sound more focused, the songs tauter in their melodies and more purposeful in their arrangements, even when those arrangements seem designed to be disorderly. The instrumentals move by their own logic—especially “Livid,” a collision of reckless post-punk guitars that recalls A Ghost Is Born—but every song makes space for a little bit of noise, a little bit of chaos. Even the relatively twangy “Say You Love Me” has a heatsick quaver as they offer up a rousing, reassuring, aching sing-along chorus that will no doubt sound great at Mass MoCA.Especially for a short EP, there are a lot of different Wilcos on Hot Sun Cool Shroud. There’s Wilco the dad rockers on “Hot Sun,” still figuring out their responsibilities to their children and everybody else. There’s Wilco the noisemakers on “Inside the Bell Bones,” screwing around in the studio. There’s Wilco the frayed worrywarts on “Ice Cream,” wondering how anybody could love them. There’s Wilco the festival organizers, Wilco the migraine rockers, Wilco the country-rock band, Wilco the goofballs, Wilco the Wilcos. To this familiar parade, add Wilco the EP band, elevating a modest tracklist into something much bigger than itself, and demonstrating how they’ve kept in touch with all those different Wilcos for so long.",Rock,8.0
180,"This internet-enabled rap trio’s new collaborative album is a brief blast of unruly energy that bounces between 5G towers in New York, Atlanta, Milwaukee, and beyond. Atlanta producer-rapper FearDorian first asked to join the NYC hip-hop collective Surf Gang six years ago. It didn’t work out—Dorian was then just 12 years old—but the young artist was undeterred, steadily racking up internet collaborations with everyone from digicore wunderkind d0llywood1 to skater-turned-lyricist Na-Kel Smith. Along the way, he co-produced tracks with Surf Gang triumvir Harrison and began sending beats to one of the collective’s OG members, Polo Perks.Perks and Dorian make a sensible combination on paper, drawing equally from the 2020s SoundCloud underground and mid-2000s Warped Tour-adjacent detritus even as their music moves in different directions. Their union with Milwaukee lowend upstart AyooLii is less intuitive: The 23-year-old rapper’s songs tend to be simpler, better suited for moving asses on dancefloors than solitary listening. But like Polo Perks, AyooLii has never met a sample that scared him, and all three members of the trio work fast. Their new collaborative album is charged with this improvisatory spirit: a brief blast of unruly energy that bounces between 5G towers in New York, Atlanta, Milwaukee, and beyond.On the freewheeling and frenetic A Dog’s Chance, familiar samples twist into endearingly bizarre shapes. Here, a warped fragment of chiptune band Anamanaguchi; there, a snippet of Hawaiian singer Israel Kamakawiwo’ole. Our intrepid protagonists barrel recklessly through these landscapes, rarely hitting a dead end. Thanks to FearDorian’s steady hand behind the boards, A Dog’s Chance manages to zig on even the zaggiest beats. The lowend drums on “BackPack” are layered over a wisp of melancholic guitar; “Skatepark” scans as straightforward sample drill for three seconds until weaving snares snap that anticipation in half. Dorian’s production here cribs heavily from Milwaukee, setting the BPM via 1-and-3 handclaps, and moderately from Surf Gang’s hazy vision of New York drill, pulling just enough from his collaborators’ home turfs to ensure they feel at ease.Yet the defining rhythms of A Dog’s Chance come from nu-jerk, the zany, burgeoning wing of the Gen Z underground that counts Xaviersobased, YhapoJJ, and FearDorian himself among its pioneers. Nu-jerk ostensibly retrofits the drum patterns of mid-2000s California jerkin’ music to modern synth loops—albeit with glitchier snares and blown-out 808s—and Dorian crushes these drums up against unusual palettes and patterns. The lowend/jerk hybrid “They Love Ayoolii” splits open to reveal a Jersey club style break, while Current Joys collab “Rockband Tees 08 Denims” treats Nick Rattigan’s sampled vocals and Polo Perks’ verses with equal respect, a nearly unintelligible mishmash that miraculously gels.",Rap,7.3
181,"Stricken by a disease that left her unable to sing, the British songwriter recruits a cast of guest vocalists for a set of songs that toy with assumptions about authorship and interpretation. Linda Thompson is best known as a singer and interpreter of someone else’s songs. A specific someone else: Richard Thompson, her ex-husband, with whom she made a few of the greatest British folk-rock albums ever as a duo in the 1970s and early ’80s, lending dignified poise to his tales of suffering and strife. Linda made one album after they broke up, then began struggling with a condition called spasmodic dysphonia, which causes involuntary contractions of the larynx that can make it difficult to sing or speak. She focused on family life and released no new music until the early 2000s, when treatment with Botox relaxed her vocal cords enough for her to make a careful comeback. The three albums she’s released since then are remarkable not only for the renewed power of her voice, but also for her emergence as a songwriter, a craft she honed when it seemed like she might never sing again.Thompson’s dysphonia has since worsened. Proxy Music, as its title cheekily suggests, is a collection of songs she wrote for other people to sing, inverting the composer-performer dynamic of her best-known work. With a few exceptions, the music, largely co-written with her and Richard’s son Teddy Thompson, could fit onto any of those classic ’70s records, with stately acoustic instrumentation and melodies that wind patiently without flashy pop hooks. Her sensibility as a lyricist is informed by the folk tradition, and she writes often about the sort of heartbreak and regret that also characterized her songs with Richard.But she’s also funny—sharper and daffier than she ever got to be as her ex’s melancholy mouthpiece. In “Or Nothing at All,” a piano ballad about unrequited affection performed tenderly by Martha Wainwright, Thompson describes true love’s deliverance not in terms of high passion, but absurd clinical precision: “A hundred men in their white coats/Would check you with their stethoscopes/And hand you straight to me.” “Shores of America,” sung by Dori Freeman from the perspective of a pioneer woman leaving a lousy partner behind in the old world, contains a zinger so good it’s hard to believe no one’s gotten to it before: “And if it’s true/That only the good die young/Lucky old you/’Cause you’ll be around until kingdom come.”Perhaps inspired by the unusual rotating-singer format or her years spent inflecting someone else’s words and melodies with her own personality, Thompson is playful and probing with notions of authorship and authenticity of voice that many other songwriters take for granted. She is especially attuned to the gradations of difference in perspective between a song’s writer, its singer, and the constructed character of its narrator. Proxy Music opens with “The Solitary Traveler,” an emotionally complex waltz whose lyrics, about a “wicked” woman who has lost her voice and the love of her child’s father, seem drawn from Thompson’s biography. But they also gesture in the direction of a folk-song stock role she was occasionally asked to play earlier in her career: the fallen woman, undone by her own bad choices, an object of both pity and scorn. By the end of the song, Thompson has turned this misogynistic archetype on its head. “I’m alone now, you’d think I’d be sad,” sings Kami Thompson, Linda and Richard’s daughter, brassy and assured. “No voice, no son, no man to be had/You’re wrong as can be boys, I’m solvent and free boys/All my troubles are gone.”",Rock,7.5
182,"The UK-born, L.A.-based rapper and beatmaker vacuums up Jersey club, Brazilian funk, classic soul, and Auto-Tune melodies for a crispy, kinetic mix with a foot in every corner of the internet. It’s the beginning of summer, skin is exposed, and the urge to get up and move is growing. Enter skaiwater: a Nottingham artist, currently stationed in L.A., who’s breaking out of the web underground with a kinetic blend of blown-out bedroom rap, futuristic R&B, and electronic experimentation. Initial iterations were moody, subdued sketches in a similar vein to Travis Scott. But when skaiwater took production into their own hands, they started multiplying the tracks in the DAW, adding layers of detail and pent-up drama. “#miles” and “eyes,” experiments indebted to Jersey club, kept the style’s pounding drums and danceable rhythms but substituted the usual raunchy lyrics for heartfelt pleas to a love interest. These singles couldn’t be as easily categorized, melding frenzied dancefloor energy with intimate thoughts typically reserved for private conversation.The imaginative tinkering culminates on skaiwater’s new album, #gigi. Primarily self-produced, it mashes together some of the decade’s most prevalent sounds into a crispy mix that plays like an amalgamation of SoundCloud likes. Beats venture all across the African diaspora; skaiwater makes excursions to chaotic Brazilian funk, Jamaican dancehall grooves, and the jittery litefeet that turns up NYC parks. Distorted bass and random EQ hijinks will terrorize your speaker. Vocal pitches fluctuate all over the place.Taking inspiration from this many places at once can mean spreading yourself thin or bloating the final product. skaiwater makes it all work by never directly emulating specific genres, instead using them as jumping-off points. Their adventurous splices generate brand-new compounds: “real feel” grabs the skittering hi-hats and shattering 808s that accompanies the off-the-wall maximalism of a natecxo beat and lays them over a ’70s soul sample. On “richest girl alive,” Auto-Tuned emo wails find pockets of melody between funk-infused drum patterns. The PARTYNEXTDOOR-core serenade “princess” builds up a pillow of delicate acoustics before climaxing into Young Thug-esque ad-libs. On “run,” Milwaukee low-end claps and New Orleans bounce rhythms poke through skaiwater’s dejected vocals.These engrossing sound beds shield a raw display of feelings. “wna torture me tn?”, a team-up with Atlanta rapper Karrahbooo, flirts with masochism: “Sacrifice me like a lamb,” skaiwater croons. “Box” sandwiches hints of obsession (“Prized possession, hang you up in my archive”) between Jersey-club bed squeaks. Confidence fuels the freeform Atlanta-sourced flows in “bleach” and “rain” as skaiwater cycles between admiration and disdain for a lover. Even Lil Nas X captures some of that suavity in his feature on “light!,” the album’s most radio-ready track and only song not produced by skaiwater: Producer 9lives’ glimmering synth piano leads the way for a streak of catchy, celebratory bars about an overdue breakup.Those sighs of relief rarely last long. skaiwater surfs between moods and soundscapes at a moment’s notice, omnivorous in a way that’s reminiscent of a young Kanye West. Perpetually restless, #gigi mines the full spectrum of musical ideas percolating through the internet, sourcing niche ingredients for a meal that offers something for every taste. Sometimes the broad scope and fast pace swallows up the endearing quirks that define specific scenes. But more often, it feels like firing up a freshly jailbroken phone: a ticket to endless possibilities concealed just out of sight.",Rap,7.4
183,"The experimental metal trio’s four-song, 76-minute album is the peak of their career. It’s dense and invigorating, highlighting the band’s dexterity, creativity, and clarity of purpose. From the start, Sumac has welcomed abundance. Singer and guitarist Aaron Turner, an omnivorous multi-disciplinary artist with some 20 musical projects to his name, feeds all of his storied past into his band with drummer Nick Yacyshyn and bassist Brian Cook. When the Pacific Northwest supergroup debuted in 2015 with The Deal, their songs were already knotty hybrids of sludge, hardcore, noise, death metal, and beyond. And each subsequent record has sounded increasingly unsatisfied with keeping pure the tenets of heavy rock’s subgenres. Whether building or deconstructing, Sumac’s open-ended metal continuously seeks to incorporate more and more and more.For all their indulgences, Sumac are veteran musicians in absolute control, whose improvisations are as exact and technically proficient as their dense, circuitous songwriting. This has never been so bluntly apparent as it is on The Healer, the trio’s fifth full-length. Sumac doubles down on everything that made them one of the most fascinating metal bands in recent memory. Grimier chords, longer and weirder freeform jams, utterly confounding rhythms, seismic heaviness, and profound humanity at its core—all sharpened for maximum effect. Their four-song, 76-minute album is a live performance tour de force unique in its dexterity, creativity, and clarity of purpose.But if jaw-dropping musicianship is a given by this point in Sumac’s career, what makes The Healer exceptional is its command of spatial presence and emotional weight. “World of Light” begins its unhinged half hour as an eldritch ooze of drone, low-end rumble, and Turner’s primal rasp. The cracked caterwaul he releases when crying out “Shiiine!” sounds more animalistic than any guttural growl could. About 11 minutes in, the music starts climbing out of the turbulent soup with slow, deliberate steps. It can feel like some kind of cosmic rebirth or spiritual awakening. Yacyshyn and Cook’s brutal rhythm section sometimes drops out completely, leaving Turner’s guitar and Faith Coloccia’s tape noise to cut haunting shapes from the void. Diving head-first into negative space, Sumac builds tension while revealing what hides beneath each onslaught.Often what The Healer reveals is hidden in plain sight. The three main instruments are recorded as if under a microscope, more intensely rendering the physicality of their moment-to-moment vibrations. Bass strings rattle against the fretboard like a chained animal; droning feedback crackles like woodfire; the toggle of guitar switches snap like dried leaves; cymbals burst and glimmer like fractals. The hyper-reality of these peripheral sounds brings a raw psychedelia to the music, which is a rich through line across The Healer. “Yellow Dawn,” full of warbling organ notes and low-slung tom patter, begins with the band’s most explicitly psychedelic arrangement. It carries through the merciless pummeling and origami time signatures to reemerge as an untethered guitar solo that’s as much “Dopesmoker” as it is “Black Hole Sun.” Such recognizable and warmly loved sounds round out the album’s more intricate stretches in a way that galvanizes both.",Metal,8.4
184,"The buzzy New York City rock quintet’s debut taps into a vivid sense of place. Their keening intensity captures a snapshot of a city coming unglued. Somewhere between the release of Meet Me in the Bathroom (the book) and Meet Me in the Bathroom (the documentary), New York’s early-aughts rock revival entered the realm of classic rock. The Strokes are fêted with vinyl box sets and a decades-too-late Grammy. Interpol are touring behind the 20th anniversary of Antics. LCD Soundsystem are in their residency era, like an Eagles alternative for people who tried Four Loko twice. And perennial underdogs the Walkmen have shape-shifted into reunion darlings.It’s all romance and mythology now. Those bands’ classic albums are as old now as Fear of Music and Parallel Lines were in 2001. Now the city’s been reborn after another world-shifting tragedy, but—amid exorbitant rents and the displacement of the creative underclass—it’s hard to imagine a new crop of bands reinvigorating the rock scene.Enter Been Stellar, an NYU-formed quintet who’ve become a ubiquitous and ambitious presence in the downtown music scene. “All of those bands—the Strokes, the Walkmen, Interpol—were a galvanizing thing for us,” guitarist Skyler Knapp recently told an interviewer. Been Stellar’s career has accelerated with similar speed. Before releasing an album, they toured with the 1975 and opened for Interpol. When I saw the group at Mercury Lounge last year, they played with a bombast and gusto that signaled they were destined for bigger venues.They may wince at being added to playlists with names like “Meet Me in the Bathroom Take 2” and grumble about Strokes comparisons, but can you blame depressed millennials for wanting to believe in the myth of rock renewal? Been Stellar may be victims of projection, but rarely has a young, hungry New York band made being a young, hungry New York band so central to their identity. On an early cut called “Manhattan Youth,” they pondered the NYC childhoods these transplants never had. Now they take inspiration from the wordless screams and chaotic sounds that define daily life in New York and title their debut album Scream From New York, NY.In the urgent, combustible opener, “Start Again,” singer Sam Slocum wanders First Avenue, trading words with a well-dressed alcoholic, before yowling a climactic refrain of “New York wasted/Start again, start again!” It’s a thrilling statement of intent. The band’s strongest songs are often rooted in the city’s peculiar landmarks. Across its formidable six minutes, “I Have the Answer” marshals waves of shoegaze sludge as Slocum describes an epiphany at the American Museum of Natural History’s whale exhibit. (Noah Baumbach, eat your heart out.) The rousing title track summons an image of the East Village’s Middle Church burning in a 2020 fire as Slocum transforms a hokey Reagan slogan (“Morning in America”) into a refrain laced with noise and dread.",Rock,7.2
185,"The Australian trio’s zonked lo-fi electronica and dub pop beams in from an alternate dimension where the primary building blocks of pop music are melodica and drum machine. It’s easy enough to identify Th Blisks’ component parts—trip-hop, torch song, post-punk, bedroom pop. It’s harder to pin down the distended, discombobulating result. Troth’s Amelia Besseny and Cooper Bowman and Low Life member Yuta Matsumura make washed-out indie dub pop songs that sound like old train cars rattling along, faded boom-bap loops and metallic post-punk guitars taking the place of dinged-up tracks and twanging overhead wires. The Australian trio made its new album, Elixa, remotely while living in Hobart, Newcastle, and Papunya, a small community outside Alice Springs. But if Elixa doesn’t quite belong to any one real place, its peculiar ambiance evokes a sprawling, desiccated urban landscape of the mind.How So?, Th Blisks’ 2022 debut, felt similarly unclassifiable: from the mondegreen-ish band name and song titles—“A Sylph,” “Taipei Dubble”—to the album cover, which featured (I think) portraits of each band member made of pebbles, it felt like an entryway into an alternate universe where the primary building blocks of pop music are melodica and drum machine. Elixa provides a clearer picture of whatever weird liminal zone Th Blisks are transmitting from: The textures and core materials are largely the same, but it feels more spacious, less lo-fi.Besseny’s vocals are still largely illegible, but occasionally a fragment of what she’s saying adds to Elixa’s air of laid-back benevolence: “It’s not without, it’s not within,” she sings on “Enchancity,” her reedy voice drifting over the beat; on “Knuckledust,” she sings of “a good place to start” over a track that sounds like “Steal My Sunshine” after a collective barbiturate overdose. The positivity within Besseny’s lyrics—“Looking for a faith/Without all the fiction,” she sings on “Do You Bless It?”—speaks to a primary appeal of Elixa: This sideways and detuned music nonetheless still conveys brightness. That’s not all it contains, though: The cavernous dirge “No Know” and the ghostly processional “Umbrah” temper Th Blisks’ warmth with a sinister, creeping edge.If you were to test a sample of Elixa’s DNA, you might trace its genealogy back to sensuous, strange ’90s artists like the Japanese trip-hop singer Poison Girl Friend or fogged-out Melbourne band Hydroplane. Th Blisks also feel like contemporaries of fellow Australians a.s.o. and YL Hooi, who releases music via Bowman’s Altered States label. Besseny’s vocals sometimes recall Grimes circa Geidi Primes. That swath of references is mostly to say that Elixa belongs to a broad canon of music that seems to exist a millimeter or two outside the space and time in which it was actually released: the soundtrack of a city that doesn’t exist and probably never will.",Electronic,7.8
186,"The corrido icon’s charisma shines on this sprawling double album, but La Doble P’s pop-star turn is less convincing. Let’s start with the Edgar mullet: the haircut that has kids all across Mexico walking into barbershops and demanding the “Peso Pluma.” This is just one of the idiosyncrasies that has made Hassan Emilio Kabande Laija the man of the moment in mainstream Spanish-language music. There is the expensive jewelry and designer clothing—Richard Mille watches, Christian Dior shoes, Maison Margiela jackets—that he regularly namechecks in his songs. There is his lanky physique. And then there is his voice: a scratchy, sometimes grating croak or rasp, depending on his mood. That singular voice sings about lots of things: popping bottles of Dom, carrying bricks of coke, assassinating enemies, hooking up with Russian models. You know, an average Tuesday.Over the last year, the 25-year-old Mexican singer of Lebanese descent has racked up a list of chart and streaming records as long as a CVS receipt, ushering música mexicana to unprecedented commercial heights. ÉXODO, his fourth studio album, is a victory lap of sorts; the LP celebrates how far the movement has come, with Pluma taking homies, cousins, and fellow trailblazers like Natanael Cano, Junior H, Tito Double P, and Eslabon Armado along for the ride. But the album is also a bona fide attempt to cement Peso Pluma’s versatility—and the longevity it promises—in the industry. ÉXODO confirms he’s one of the most charismatic corrido performers of our time, but as for his ability to shapeshift across genres and flows, Peso Pluma the pop star still has some convincing to do.The crackle of Peso’s voice is the molten core of ÉXODO. Its peculiarity is a blessing, but in some moments, it can also be a curse. His coarse growl is especially effective on the bare-knuckle norteño “La People II,” which seems to be written from the perspective of Joel Enrique “El 19” Sandoval Romero, a sicario and security chief for the Sinaloa cartel who was arrested by the Mexican government in 2014. Pluma and his guests snarl viciously as they recount tales of battling police officers, the national guard, and the military to protect their bosses (ostensibly Ovidio Guzmán López, a high-ranking leader of the Sinaloa cartel and the son of El Chapo) from capture. Peso assumes the voice of El 19, asking his associates to take care of his “land, his family, and his parents,” presumably while he’s locked up.The debate about artists’ roles in glamorizing narco culture didn’t start with—and won’t end with—Peso Pluma. Too often, narcocorrido stars have become ideological scapegoats for the federal government’s failure to curb violence; other times, artists have denied they have any sociocultural impact at all. The discourse is fraught, but one thing is certain: Pluma excels when he performs the mythos of narco culture, no holds barred. It places him firmly within the genealogy of his forebears, like his late idols Chalino Sánchez and Ariel Camacho, who showed a similar talent for passionate storytelling, even as they romanticized narratives of murder and revenge. La Doble P reimagines that tradition on “Put Em in the Fridge,” a cold corrido-trap beat built on a blaring horn loop. He tries on a squeaky but bellicose cadence for size, bragging with Cardi B about moving kilos and calling on shooters to put their enemies on ice. Cardi’s gift for rapping athletically in both Dominican Spanish and English makes her a natural collaborator here; the pair goes bar for bar in a thrilling, peacocking display. It’s also a sublime example of Pluma’s talent for redefining his musical heritage for the present day.",Folk,6.9
187,"The saxophone-and-drum duo’s muscular, distorted, freeform tracks connect the London post-punk and jazz scenes like an arcane new subplot. After cutting their teeth playing around London, saxophonist Joe Henwood and drummer Tash Keary linked up to jam during pandemic lockdowns. As gigs returned, O. became an official duo, taking up residence at Windmill Brixton—the South London venue now famous as the incubator for acts like Shame, Squid, black midi, and Black Country, New Road. They caught the ear of Dan Carey, the prolific producer linked to almost everyone in the current UK post-punk boom, and recorded the charmingly titled WeirdOs for his Speedy Wunderground label. But if “post-punk” quickly became a reductive umbrella for the host of adventurous bands percolating in South London, O. represent a particularly arcane new subplot.While Henwood and Keary came up in London’s equally vibrant and of-the-moment jazz scene, O. are not jazz. They aren’t any one thing, but a collision of Henwood and Keary’s disparate interests, name-checking everything from dub to Deftones, noise to A Tribe Called Quest. The two boast jazz technicality, but perform with the viscerality of punk and metal, while favoring textures and colors more akin to bug-eyed electronic music. Their style is muscular, high intensity, and a little gonzo. Keary’s drumming is typically furious yet precise, Henwood’s baritone sax riffs heaving and monolithic. This was the energy that producer Carey sought to capture: WeirdOs was cut live to tape in two weeks, seeking to replicate the urgency of O.’s gigs.Everything in O. is about mutation as the duo chase freeform ideas far into the ether. Much of this experimentation is achieved by Henwood’s extensive manipulation of his sax, filtered through an array of effects pedals. On penultimate standout “Sugarfish,” you can feel the bodily heft in his distorted lead, before it turns into something more closely resembling aqueous synths, only to resurface sounding almost like a guitar.O. pull off similar tricks across WeirdOs. “Micro” sounds like a smeared electronic track, melting Keary’s jungle breakbeats and Henwood’s sax nearly beyond recognition. O.’s fascination with metal shines through in the foreboding rhythms of “Cosmo” and “Slap Juice.” On “Whammy,” Keary switches from blitzkrieg propulsion to suggestive tumbles, Henwood from the natural guttural strength of the bari to more otherworldly and sinuous lines, before the whole thing erupts again in its final act.While hooks abound, WeirdOs also plays as one big, roiling piece. Like the live jams from which it emerged, the album has peaks and valleys, passages of unrelenting intensity followed by space-out cooldowns that offer the slightest moment to breathe. Those with jazz predilections might hear it as a violent deconstruction of the genre, while followers of London’s rock scene might perceive O. as the most eccentric wanderers to yet grace the Windmill’s stage. No matter how WeirdsOs reveals itself to you, O.’s debut is a testament to Keary and Henwood’s fearlessness and dexterity. They take the limitations of two players and two common instruments, and tell the story in a way never heard before.",Rock,7.3
188,"Assembled in a year-long process of file-swapping between Berlin and L.A., this hazy, collage-like album takes the form of a wordless conversation. It’s uncanny, familiar, and warmly evocative. When the multi-instrumentalist and visual artist Tim Koh was three or four years old, Elvis Presley’s 1973 concert from Hawaii played regularly on the family’s newly acquired color television. “I had a fuzzy, round pillow that I’d stand on as a stage and pretend to perform [on],” he told the Talkhouse. Eventually, he found actual stages to play on and spent some two decades working with fellow travelers including Animal Collective, Hieroglyphic Being, DJ Harvey, and No Age. Now based in Berlin, Koh recently began a kind of email-based game of exquisite corpse with L.A.-based graphic and sound designer Sun An, who’d been releasing his own music for over a decade.Salt and Sugar Look the Same unfolds the results of their back-and-forth across some 18 miniatures that sound like half-overheard conversations only half-remembered. Sine waves ripple and snap; warm whooshes of melody float tropically in the mist; voices sing at uncanny speeds. All this is nothing exactly new—deja vu put to disc has a legacy going back at least to Erik Satie, passing through the eternal Éliane Radigue hum and still unparalleled otherworldliness of early Boards of Canada records. But part of the point of this kind of communication is the generous recognition of the familiar. Friendship sprouts from common ground.Opener “Bye Bye Betty” sends a voice message, made mechanically variable in pitch and speed, over wires of acoustic guitars; by “Besafe Airtel,” the wires tangle into brambles. Tracks like “Old Plates and Desirable Traits” and “Drawing to Relax and Pass the Time” build little worlds of acoustic and electric sources, the former with a bit of new-wave froideur and the latter so warm and wet you could get bitten by all the little buzzing things flying around. It’s a rare bit of muchness on an otherwise restrained record: “The Maybes Are Endless” distills everything to two chords strummed on an electric guitar, a rocking chair blues.There are also synesthetic aims. “Yume-No-Yume” curls in the air like its namesake incense, often a combination of plum and cherry blossoms and lavender designed to help the sniffer remember dreams. “Incense Holder,” with its glinting glitches, also plays as it’s named, a faceted structure to hold ineffable sound. And the golden plumes of “Lemongrass Citronella” are powerful enough to keep those biters at bay.It’s not all bliss, though. “Today Only Happens Once” approaches a kind of industrial unease that seems equally nostalgic for Throbbing Gristle and the occult grooviness of Scooby Doo soundtracks. Some tracks plank—the drone of “Somewhere in Time,” for example, suspends itself with rickety strength and the echo of sweat—and others, like “Twice” ache like the memory of exertion. A high-pitched whistle cuts through foggy closer “Expected to Fade” like a tea kettle—time to wake up—before a thick blanket of hiss drags you under. This is music more for giving in than letting go.",Electronic,7.4
189,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit the subversive 1984 debut from the UK synth-pop group, an exquisite-sounding album that snuck an ode to amyl nitrate and orgasms onto pop charts around the world. Think of the flush that must have crept over Mike Read’s face the moment he realized that when Frankie sang “come,” they meant cum. Pupils and capillaries dilated, he must have scanned the lyrics printed on the sleeve of “Relax” and read the word “suck” as if for the first time in his life. By the time the BBC 1 Radio DJ declared the song “obscene” on air, “Relax” had already become a mainstay on his station—contemporary estimates say it played 70 to 100 times in six weeks—extolling the pleasures of gay sex to some thousands of unsuspecting listeners. Eleven days into 1984, “Relax” fluttered to No. 6 on the UK charts. Yanked from airplay, it soared to the top by the end of the month.The tale of Read’s sudden panic quickly grew. Before long, he hadn’t just declined to play the single on his hit countdown show; he had dragged the needle off the disc halfway through its runtime and banned it on the spot. Depending on who’s telling the story, he also either flung the record against the wall or snapped it over his knee. For his part, Read claims he wasn’t all that bothered; he simply ran out of airtime. But he will concede that he noticed some “vile words” and a “simulated phallus” printed on the cover, and he did indeed pronounce the whole thing obscene.While he didn’t have the authority to ban “Relax” from broadcast himself, Read’s declaration made its way up the chain, scandalizing BBC executives as it went. Apparently, it had never occurred to them that “come” meant anything other than showing up. “The group seemed to confirm [the lyrics] as referring to fellatio and ejaculation, which are not exactly subjects which I think are appropriate for broadcasting on the radio,” said Derek Chinnery, BBC 1 Controller, two weeks after Read’s proclamation. “We could have said there is a dual meaning to this song, that it was a kind of nonsense lyric about relaxing. But when the performers themselves confirmed that it was referring to these sexual aberrations then it didn’t seem to me appropriate that we should play it at all.” That day, the BBC learned a key lesson: If you don’t know what a song is about, it’s probably about sex. And if you’re certain a song is about nothing, it’s definitely about sex.“Relax,” the crown jewel in Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s debut album, Welcome to the Pleasuredome, went largely unnoticed for the first three months after its release in the fall of 1983. An irresistible performance on the Top of the Pops’ 20th-anniversary show catapulted the single into public consciousness: Lead singer Holly Johnson vamped along to its pre-recorded studio glitz dressed in leather and flagging piss, while his co-vocalist Paul Rutherford—the handsome clone to Johnson’s charismatic scamp—danced as if he had just stumbled into the eighth discotheque of the night. The BBC fracas cemented the song’s illicit appeal. Everything that was supposed to nip a music career in the bud—politics, overproduction, overt homosexuality, censorship—only poured fuel on Frankie’s fire.",Rock,8.7
190,"The pair’s debut collaboration is an amorphous, droning flood that sounds like the advent of the end times. In its hopeless sound world lies a poignant condemnation of colonial violence. Disconnect opens like a pit slowly forming in your stomach. A featureless, windswept expanse emerges from the silence, and distant booms ring out on the horizon. The first sign of life is far from reassuring: a chorus of sighs and exhalations, the universal sound of hopelessness. “Differences” and the subsequent “Arkives” never really pick up momentum, only accumulating more shades of gray as they sprawl onward across double-digit runtimes. These two tracks comprise half of Disconnect on their own, and Kevin Richard Martin and KMRU spend the remainder of the album stripping them down and peeling back the layers in classic dub fashion—until they resemble errant puffs of smoke escaping from a Rhythm & Sound track.Anyone familiar with the works of the two artists shouldn’t be surprised by how grim their debut collaboration sounds. Martin is best-known for the mind-melting dubstep he makes as the Bug, but he’s recorded much of his best work over the last decade in a more ambient register, including his nerve-wracking solo album Sirens and the great Concrete Desert with drone legends Earth. KMRU, born Joseph Kamaru, broke out with 2020’s Peel on the late Peter Rehberg’s Editions Mego label, and has since amassed an eclectic if generally monochromatic catalog. These are musicians who thrive in blasted, apocalyptic sound worlds; Disconnect is a natural extension of both of their repertoires.What’s a surprise on Disconnect is the inclusion of Kamaru’s vocals. His spoken-word passages expand on a theme he previously explored on his 2022 album Temporary Stored: the theft of African artifacts by Western museums and archives. “African traditions are passed across through apprenticeship and other oral traditions,” the Kenyan-born artist explains on “Arkives,” as opposed to the Western emphasis on written documents deemed “ontologically concrete.” On both albums, Kamaru argues that the keeping of African artifacts in Western museums distorts their meaning and purpose, as many of these items are “more than just objects” in their own cultures.Martin first discovered Kamaru through a documentary and was attracted to his musical sensibilities as well as the quality of his voice. Across the four versions of “Differences” and “Arkives” that constitute the album’s second half, Martin chops Kamaru’s voice into tiny fragments, emphasizing the “ark” part of “archives”: It’s an appropriate choice for a record that sounds like the first showers of a cataclysmic flood. At first, it might escape a casual listener’s notice that these are six variations on two songs, not because the versions are radically different from each other, but because the sound palette is so consistent and so subdued that it all eventually blurs into an amorphous miasma.",Experimental,7.3
191,"Byran Müller’s latest LP plays like a guided tour of his catalog. It’s some of his warmest and most inviting music to date. Before he was Skee Mask, Bryan Müller was SCNTST. Monday, the Munich producer’s debut EP, is straightforward and delirious, full of tightly wound grooves and head-spinning change-ups; it rockets between electro, ghettotech, juke, and techno, each track containing as many ideas as it does drum patterns. With that EP, Müller was looking less toward science than alchemy—an approach that proved indicative. As Skee Mask, Müller has spent the past decade combining dance-music histories in all sorts of beguiling ways: dubbed-out hardgroove techno, fleet-footed drum ’n’ bass and bone-chilling ambience, psychedelic and minimalistic IDM. Resort, the electronic producer’s latest LP, may be his most potent distillation yet. Here, he makes his club-ready approach to historiography clear, crumpling up timelines and sketching out a universe.While particular details change from record to record, Müller’s tunes often harbor a similar feeling: It is heart-on-sleeve and tough at once, every drum landing with an icy precision and each keyboard stretching towards the skies. Even as he pans from one genre to another, that emotive approach serves as his bedrock. His music sits at the intersections of breakbeats, ambient music, and techno; over the years, he’s become so adept behind the boards that any seams are more or less invisible. His catalog is equally suited for basement raves, 4 a.m. highways, and sun-drenched afternoons—pitch the bass accordingly and you’re good to go. Resort takes full advantage of this range, playing like a guided tour of Müller’s catalog, each kick drum landing with the quiet intimacy of a familiar heartbeat.Part of the thrill of Resort is in watching Müller stretch out a bit, exploring new territories by revisiting old traditions. In doing so, he offers up some of his warmest and most inviting music to date, giving his always-precise drum programming a sepia-tinged hue. In its best moments, the LP sounds beamed in from a slightly different universe, one in which Warp and Rephlex never left the mid-’90s and every sample arrived blanketed in a thin layer of dust. “BB Care,” thanks to its ramshackle drums, dreamy synth pads, and barely there vocal samples, feels like a forgotten bonus track from Music Has the Right to Children. “Hölzl Was a Dancer,” a house-music stomper with shuffle-and-skip drums and an acrobatic bassline, might have lit up dancefloors in 1992. The hazy synth workout “Hedwig Transformation Group” recalls GAS at his most blissed-out, while “Waldmeister” displays Müller’s ambient-techno chops, with sun-dappled synthesizers gleaming amid groaning bass.",Electronic,7.7
192,"The former Ought members’ second album balances economy with exploration, reaffirming their place in a lineage of prickly, leftfield guitar rock. In the dozen or so years that Tim Darcy and Ben Stidworthy have been playing together—first in Ought, and now, with drummer Evan Cartwright, as Cola—their music’s defining characteristics haven’t changed much. The two still specialize in a knotty, post-punky brand of indie rock embedded with cryptic yet conversational observations about maintaining one’s sanity in the modern world. But when you compare Ought’s 2014 debut, More Than Any Other Day, to the music Cola are making now, it’s like listening to completely different musicians—and the contrast goes beyond the fact that their current trio seemingly has no use for a keyboardist. Ought always sounded like a band in flux, unfurling their tightly wound sound for deeper explorations in drone and groove, while Darcy wielded his mercurial voice with theatrical aplomb. But Cola’s second album, The Gloss, is a model of focus, precision, and economy—the sound of players who know exactly who they are and what they want to do.Listening to The Gloss feels a lot like sitting in on a practice session in a windowless jam space the night before a gig—a nervous, claustrophobic tension hangs in the air, but everyone is completely locked in and buzzing with energy. Unlike like their pandemic-spawned, file-swapped 2022 debut, Deep in View, The Gloss was recorded as Cola came into their own as a touring act, and as such, the album foregrounds their intuition and rapport and keeps their spoken-word piano-jazz proclivities at bay. But while The Gloss renews Cola’s membership in a fraternity of prickly, leftfield guitar rock that runs through Television, Sonic Youth, and Women, they use their discord less to agitate than ingratiate.These tracks are largely confined to three-minute bursts, but each exhibits that special sense of discovery that results when close friends instinctively follow one another’s lead, and a simple chord change or strategic pause can instantly transform a song’s essence. Cuts like “Tracing Hallmarks” tick all the boxes on the contemporary post-punk checklist—jabbing guitar lines, propulsive rhythms, staccato phrasing—but they also shift into surprisingly congenial choruses that lend Cola uncommon lightness and levity. On “Albatross,” Darcy sings, “I’m a lame horse with an optimistic mind,” making explicit a theme running throughout: In a world that’s constantly trying to beat you down, staying positive constitutes an act of radicalism.Like Stephen Malkmus, Darcy favors language that’s equally evocative and enigmatic, routinely blurring the line between the sardonic and sincere. His most pointed social commentary comes through on “Down to Size,” which suggests an urban activist version of the Strokes: the song revisits the topic of gentrification previously referenced on Ought’s 2015 slow-burning masterpiece “Beautiful Blue Sky,” but at a more frantic pace that mirrors the ruthless breakneck speed of development. More often, he takes delight in overarching metaphors that simultaneously obscure and amplify his intent, whether using journalist lingo to frame a couple’s communication breakdown (“Pulling Quotes”) or invoking film-set imagery to highlight the performative aspects of daily life. (“My taste is avant-poor,” he cheekily declares on “Pallor Tricks,” and somewhere, a slumming trust-fund kid weeps.)",Rock,7.6
193,"The singer’s debut album is an intimate, soulful project that spotlights her versatile voice and the experimental touches that give the album its unique texture. Zsela’s music is rooted in intimacy, a term that both describes a profound closeness and serves as a euphemism for, well, fucking. In the case of the Brooklyn-based artist’s debut full-length, Big for You, her portrayal of intimacy is firmly the former. That isn’t to say the album isn’t sexy, but that her music retains the tenderness of a blossoming crush and the feelings that swell when you realize you’re witnessing parts of someone that typically remain unseen. Listening to Big for You is a bit like doing that “36 Questions That Lead to Love” exercise with the 29-year-old singer. From the first second of her new record, she introduces (or reintroduces) listeners to her hypnotic, honeyed voice and reels them into mutual vulnerability with each subsequent word.In 2019, Zsela’s debut track “Noise” had a nocturnal beauty to her brooding, contralto vocals, and in 2020, her Ache of Victory perked the ears of Sade-worshippers with its memorable lo-fi R&B, including the nostalgia anthem “Earlier Days.” (Zsela, née Zsela Thompson, has a musical pedigree; her father, Marc Anthony Thompson, is the neo-soul artist Chocolate Genius.) Since then, Zsela has chiseled away at her full-length while performing alongside Caroline Polachek, Arooj Aftab, and Cat Power. She once again taps producers Daniel Aged (Frank Ocean, Kelela, FKA twigs) and Gabe Wax (the War on Drugs, Soccer Mommy), resulting in an eclectic, experimental album that straddles the worlds of alt R&B and folky indie rock.The record is an exercise in presence, at times taking in deep pulls of oxygen, at other points folding into lyrical repetition or dropping surprises that leave listeners breathless. Zsela opens the slow jam “Fire Excape” crooning a cappella in her falsetto. Then, over a building funk bassline, she sings that she’s falling in love as day breaks on the fire escape. A moment later, a hose-blast of synths drenches her voice as she finds herself helplessly “falling down” into infatuation. It’s one of the most evocative vocal hooks (and earworms) on the album, and the boingy, sultry bassline brings to mind the more spartan pop-funk arrangements of Prince, combining the remixability of a club track with the hushedness of a coffee-shop confessional.She seems to have found that if you want to be heard in a crowded room, don’t shout—get close and speak softly. The melancholy “Moth Dance” gradually lets out layers of musical fabric; Zsela repeats “I am alive” over and over at its end, finally with a quivering voice, like an affirmation that never really resonated until now. On “Lily of the Nile,” she reveals, in a husky stage whisper, that she “hitched a ride with the bride last night” as though she’s telling you a salacious secret. And “Not Your Angel,” a cheerfully breathy electropop anthem, treats lyrical obstinance as a flirting tactic and evokes the emotive, hook-forward baroque pop of Annie Lennox’s “Walking on Broken Glass.”",Folk,7.5
194,"On their first new album in six years, the folk troubadours balance out-of-time balladry with a mature sensibility that’s attuned to melancholy and mortality in the present. Once a figure of ridicule and derision, the nerd defined the first decades of the 21st century even more than the hipster or the bro. This seemed like a promising development, before it soured into misogynistic gaming culture and The Big Bang Theory. The Decemberists, named after an obscure Russian revolution (which they winkingly misspelled), represented a more benevolent side of geekdom: They were smart, of course, but also very passionate about arcana. They fussed over prog-folk epics, sea shanties, and Shirley Collins the way other nerds nitpicked D&D campaigns or Star Wars canon. We knew the terrain of frontman Colin Meloy’s inner emotional life not through confessional lyrics but through his obsessions.The Decemberists weren’t rock nerds, though, which may be why actual rock nerds dismissed them in their heyday. Instead, they were theater nerds—a wildly intense phylum of geek. Meloy wrote songs like playlets, constantly implying a proscenium, and the band performed them like a troupe of thespians, occasionally even reenacting Tolkien battles onstage. There was an element of playacting in every song, which made them seem like the nerdiest band around (even Barenaked Ladies’ theme songs never went that deep). That dramaturgical proclivity festooned quote marks around certain songs (“The Mariner’s Revenge Song”) and even entire albums (The Hazards of Love), but their music always seemed to spring from a benign fixation with the historic and the folkloric.With their ninth studio album, the Decemberists have done something that few 21st-century nerds even consider: They’ve matured in their relationship with their obsessions. They’ve grown up. Not a lot, but enough. The archaic syntax of the title As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again suggests a “return to form” or at the very least a career retrospective. But the album is nothing quite so lofty: The Decemberists are dressing up in yesteryear’s costumery—the character-driven songs of Picaresque, the jangle rock of The King Is Dead, the shaky political engagement of I’ll Be Your Girl—but there are no quote marks around these songs. It’s more a personal reckoning with their own past: a rummage sale of dusty enthusiasms.So there’s an unexpected melancholy to these new story-songs, a poignancy that wouldn’t have been possible 15 or 20 years ago. Meloy understands we obsess differently in our dotage, with a new sense of impermanence and a more acute understanding of mortality. He has sung about death many times before, but it sounds a little more immediate on opener “Burial Ground.” There’s an easy charm in Meloy’s gashlycrumb wit and in the band’s ability to combine various influences so that the familiar—’60s folk melodies and pop arrangements—sounds slightly unplaceable. Is it more Beach Boys outtake or more pre-Days of Future Passed Moody Blues? “Burial Ground” operates not unlike Fairport Convention’s “Come All Ye”: It’s an invocation, an invitation to the graveyard, and the Decemberists know we’re all headed in that direction anyway.",Rock,7.2
195,"On his 17th solo album under the alias, Mike Paradinas looks fondly back upon IDM’s melodic golden age and finds sneaky ways to make familiar ideas sound fresh. For a style ostensibly rooted in club culture, IDM has long felt like the concerned frown on the face of electronic music: a place where gnarled experimentation trumps whimsical adventure and fun is sacrificed on the altar of technique. Enter Mike Paradinas, a producer who was making leftfield dance music when Selected Ambient Works 85-92 was a new release, rather than a dusty classic. Grush, Paradinas’ 17th solo album as µ-Ziq, strives to put the “dance” back into IDM, inspired by the kind of melodic, oddball post-rave music that gave rise to the genre back in the 1990s: Aphex Twin, early Autechre, Black Dog Productions, and even Orbital.Given that self-appointed mission, Grush could easily have been a nostalgic stroll through the glory days of the ’90s, when Paradinas was feted as one of the hottest names in electronic music. Anyone who loves Aphex Twin’s Hangable Auto Bulb EPs or Paradinas’ own 1997 album Lunatic Harness will find much to love in Grush’s vibrant melodies and intricately funky rhythms. “Fogou” is a glorious combination of driving, neo-classical synth and glitched-out drums; the pounding “Reticulum B” has the distinct air of Sabres of Paradise’s wobbly-lipped, cerebral techno classic “Smokebelch II”; and “Manscape” sounds like Orbital's “Belfast” being dissected by sharply angled breaks.The difference here—and it can be subtle—is that the drums on Grush frequently sound like they were recorded live, which is unusual for the breaks- and drum-machine-heavy world of IDM. They weren’t, but the intention is there: The tambourine on “Fogou” and “Belvedere” consists of single hits, programmed slightly out of time to simulate real playing, while the shuffling snare and hi-hat pattern on “Hyper Daddy” bears a similarly human sense of flux. “Hyper Daddy,” which Paradinas created specifically to play live, is the song where the producer’s focus on dance is most obvious: Three different drum lines tease, fidget, and needle with the listener’s adrenal response.Grush’s predictably excellent drums are the mark of a producer who has been cutting up breaks for decades. But perhaps the most purely enjoyable part of the record lies in its array of sumptuous melodies, which evoke the classical prog of Tangerine Dream, Mike Oldfield’s Tubular Bells, or even, gulp, Marillion. At least two of Grush’s 14 tracks, “Hyper Daddy” and “Hastings,” have artful key changes that lend a very prog-ish musicality to proceedings, and immaculately clean keyboard lines send the listener back to the hi-fi-enhanced stereoscopic sound of the ’70s.",Electronic,7.6
196,"The pop singer’s long-awaited debut is also a comeback and reintroduction. With her plush voice and slick production, she plays it cool and also plays it safe. Whether they admit it or not, every former girl-group singer wants their solo debut to hit like “2003 Beyoncé performing ‘Crazy in Love.’” Four years ago, Normani came remarkably close with the sprightly R&B track “Motivation.” The single, and its Aaliyah-inspired follow-up “Wild Side,” capitalized on the pageantry that made her stand out in Fifth Harmony. After two unforgettable VMA performances—the handstand-into-a-split in 2019 and the steamy Janet Jackson homage in 2021—Normani laid low; both parents were battling cancer, and shifting management due to creative differences didn’t make anything easier. DOPAMINE, her highly anticipated debut-slash-comeback album, still can’t shake the anonymity of her ensemble days, but it lays the foundation for what Normani will be known for: her Southern roots and a voice as plush as a pair of fuzzy dice.Rather than the bubbly pop of “Motivation,” which Normani has notably tried to distance herself from, DOPAMINE trades in the suave R&B of her childhood. “Lights On” is reminiscent of the sultry yet danceable croons of noughties Janet. “Insomnia,” co-written by none other than Brandy, could slot into the R&B star’s 2002 album Full Moon. The writing is solid and witty (“Don’t even address me unless you gon’ undress me”) but musically, the primary tasting notes are understated familiarity and reverence for the past. Normani’s smooth vocals are the only quality truly unique to her, and at times even that induces a highway hypnosis effect.Normani is at her best when she is brash and animated, channeling sounds and flows from her Southern youth. She’s got ties to Atlanta, New Orleans, and Houston all over the album: “Bling-bling-blaow” she sings of her platinum records and iced-out jewelry over a funky bassline on horn-laden opener “Big Boy,” complemented by Starrah’s Auto-Tune’d flexes. “Candy Paint” has the potential to eclipse the braggadocious aura of “Big Boy” but Normani’s laid-back flow becomes monotonous even when her tempo quickens. She leans heavily into her Texas roots on the album highlight “Still,” when she flips a testosterone-filled Mike Jones sample into a strip-club anthem for the ladies kicking up their feet and making it rain hundreds.DOPAMINE is a solid reintroduction to Normani’s sultrier side that, unfortunately, currently exists in a similar conundrum as Dua Lipa post-Future Nostalgia: Her mysteriously cool it-girl persona is thrilling in three-minute doses, but after a couple of tracks with big hooks, you come across some filler. On DOPAMINE, the house-lite of “Take My Time,” the Kelly Rowland’s “Commander” dupe “Little Secrets,” and the James Blake-assisted “Tantrums” feel obligated to demonstrate versatility through genre experimentation. At times it feels like a solo artist searching for an identity through sound, not always through songwriting.Though she has writing credits on a majority of the album, Normani’s solo songs often feel plucked from a communal pile. As an alum of one of the biggest American girl groups, a survivor of Hurricane Katrina, and a person who has had to confront mortality and celebrity from a young age, Normani’s story seems ripe for an album format—once she’s ready to tell it.",Pop,7.4
197,"The California singer-songwriter’s third album pulls sounds from all across the psychedelic neo-soul spectrum as she muses about matters of the heart. Fana Hues’ voice can only be described as romantic. Whether she’s singing about new love or loneliness, her timbre often transmits a sumptuous sense of desire. It bounces jauntily through the dubby piano and flirtatious sway of Tyler, the Creator’s “SWEET / I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO DANCE,” but it also swims through rivers of uncertainty and reverb-drenched guitar on 2022’s “dayxday,” always brimming with hope like a spring sunrise. That aura has surrounded her music, starting from her early years singing in her family band and in school productions of The Wiz to her first two solo albums, 2020’s Hues and 2022’s flora + fana. Hues has said she wants to “showcase the full spectrum of emotion” in her work, which unfurls through her hummingbird-delicate vocal runs. Her third studio album Moth—short for Matters of the Heart—shows Hues at her most assured, standing on firmer sentimental ground as a writer, singer, and lover.In the past, the content of Hues’ love songs often scraped against their brighter presentation. flora + fana’s “breakfast” feels like gossamer—glittering, doo-wop guitar strums succumbing to a wall of lush bass and synths—but in its pure wistfulness, its story of post-relationship sorrow reads more like a hollowed-out Harlequin romance novel. “Must’ve left my heart where my head is…Woke up in the wrong day; forgot breakfast,” she says sweetly, forcing herself through the motions. But Moth largely moves with more clarity and confidence. In the bridge of “Gone Again,” she’s approaching a similar situation from the other side. This time, she’s the one questioning where the relationship stands, content to work through any fallout: “I know you’re here with me, we’re fine/And what we are won’t be defined/Still I need you to say ‘You’re mine baby.’” Uncertainty still lingers, but this time, she’s the one calling the shots.Like the insect the album is named after, in her metamorphosis, Hues molts fear and doubt—and embraces a lust for life. Take the dancefloor-ready single “Rental,” where she compares a casual fling to the thrill of joyriding in a fancy car: “Let’s forget the safety/Ain’t no destination/Ain’t no course/Don’t it feel better when it ain’t yours?” Or consider “What Speaks,” which ditches metaphor entirely and asks a potential partner what exactly their desires are in and out of the bedroom. Hues isn’t just welcoming the future, she’s relishing in it. Producer Josh Grant—who has credits on nearly every song—offers up waves of hearty digital and acoustic funk that wash these mini-affairs in vibrant technicolor.",Pop,7.5
198,"Twinkling riffs collide with dial-up static and blown-out drums on a collaborative album from the bit-crushing electronic maximalists and the South Korean dream-pop darling. Fax Gang’s hyper-compressed songs sound like murmurs transmitted from virtual reality. The multinational collective—currently made up of Philippines-based vocalist PK Shellboy and producers GLACIERbaby, maknaeslayer, and kimj—are known for bit-crushing Drain Gang-esque vocals and electronics into distorted masses of sound. Parannoul, meanwhile, is a pseudonymous South Korean artist who crafts fuzzy sketches using synthetic instruments like MIDI guitars. Within their insular worlds, each act explores feelings of insecurity and depression through different processes, yet both produce similarly raw music.Fax Gang and Parannoul’s new collaborative album, Scattersun, bursts outward with messy energy. The way Parannoul’s heavy-lidded voice drifts above the sparkling keys of opener “Quiet” might resemble After the Magic, but the song’s movements are volatile and sharp, cresting in sudden explosions that mirror the artists’ anxious mindsets. Written and produced entirely over text, Scattersun is constantly cracking open, expelling static hiss, breakbeats, and stray metallic clangs from its airtight casing. Any space for quiet is often crammed with soundbites, like the rev of a motor or a screwball saxophone solo.To match the blown-out landscape, Fax Gang explore alternatives to the flattened vocals of their previous work. On the twitchy stream of consciousness “Double Bind,” PK Shellboy switches between a partially bit-crushed effect and their unaltered voice, squeezing out enough dread to match the UK garage beat’s foreboding shuffle. Though outclassed by South Korean rapper Mudd the student’s verse on “Wrong Signal,” PK Shellboy’s wheezy rambling is more convincingly paranoid. Their unease sounds visceral: “Time keeps on passing with every day/Yet nothing gets better,” they gasp, voice tense and filled with trepidation.Parannoul remains a characteristically demure presence, anchoring the record with faint keys and a hushed voice. His balmy verse on “Lullaby for a Memory” offers a reprieve from PK Shellboy’s anxiety about growing older, even as it’s pelted with harsh breakbeats. Only on “Soliloquy” does Parannoul’s voice rise to a full-throated scream, a forceful moment overshadowed by the surrounding noise. If PK Shellboy raves about turning into the devil, Parannoul sounds like just one resident of Hell.The lure of Scattersun is its contrasting textures—twinkling riffs against dial-up static and explosive synths over hollowed-out drums. Occasionally, the many layers fuse into a monolith. The title track’s 10-minute span recalls “White Ceiling,” from Parannoul’s To See the Next Part of the Dream, but where that song laboriously built to catharsis, “Scattersun” stitches several ideas together, each demanding equal intensity. “Sometimes/I feel like I’m in a car crash/Nothing I can do to stop it,” PK Shellboy announces at the top. The track’s spontaneous turns from apocalyptic rave synths to gliding four-on-the-floor to condensed noise might replicate the vocalist’s turbulent moods, but those same abrupt changes can be draining to listen to. More dynamic than either artist’s work alone, Scattersun pushes them into the burning wreckage of reality, where everything feels brilliant yet overwhelming.",Rap,7.0
199,"Assisted by players like Sam Gendel and André 3000, the ambient-jazz bandleader explores the spiritual and psychedelic aspects of human birth. As a potentially psychedelic experience that often transcends description, new-age music finds an unexpected analog in human birth. There’s nothing trippier or more ineffable than generating new life, deploying cellular tools to create something more than the sum of its parts. With tracks like “Generous Pelvis” and “Placenta, Nourishment, New Home, The Galaxy,” Carlos Niño & Friends’ Placenta makes explicit the connection between the genre’s fascination with womb-like sounds and the physical odyssey of labor. Assembling a who’s-who of the L.A. ambient-jazz scene—including tourmate André 3000, who plays flute on “Birthworkers Magic, and how we get hear…”—and a heady concoction of bells, chimes, synths, whistles, leaves, plants, and shakers, Niño and his far-out compatriots develop an LP with a life of its own—a gestalt marvel.Opening track “Love to all Doulas!” sets the tone for this mystical instrumental odyssey, Nate Mercereau’s horns punctuating a drone that builds like something (or someone) crowning. “Some rest for the Midwives…” locks us into the groove, an itinerant shuffle that was recorded live with drummer Jamire Williams and saxophonist Sam Gendel in the historically spiritual SoCal town of Ojai. Later, the sound of breathwork and an accordion expand and contract like two sets of ribs on “Placenta, Nourishment, New Home, The Galaxy.”Thematic breaks, like the compact and propulsive “In Appreciation of Chico Hamilton’s Vast Influence on the West Coast Sound,” provide a welcome respite from feet-in-the-stirrups embodiment. They also keep the record from becoming too conceptually on the nose, flexing Niño & Friends’ range and dynamism. “This ‘I’ was not” takes French composer Ariel Kalma’s spoken-word meditation on ego and lifts it out of the yoga studio with shimmering cymbals and warbling organ. “Either you is, or not. Not more. Nevertheless, life is—always,” he intones, teasing a Seussian riddle stage-set with celestial sounds. “Bi-Location,” another (undetectably) live recording named after the concept of inhabiting two different places in the same physical body at the same time, showcases Andres Renteria’s nimble hand drumming underneath a layer of hazy synthesizer, a sound like something crawling towards the surface and then panting in the aftermath against Aaron Shaw’s dreamy tenor sax.Like much of Carlos Niño & Friends’ work, the record straddles the boundary between structure and improvisation, jazzy riffs and spasms that return to the gravitational pull of a central motif. “Surges, Expansions” feels the most in progress and least finished, a little unsure of itself (albeit aptly titled). “Moonlight Watsu in Dub” is the record’s most conventional attempt at a groove, groomed enough to play in the lobby of a chic hotel, and all the less interesting because of it.",Jazz,7.9
200,"Densely packed and deeply sincere, the latest chapter of David Bazan’s musical memoir project spans a decade of life, from eighth grade into his early 20s. The first song on Santa Cruz, the seventh full-length album from Seattle’s Pedro the Lion, paraphrases no fewer than four separate Bible verses. More to the point, singer-songwriter David Bazan speaks in the kind of idioms that anyone who’s attended a Wednesday night youth group or summer church camp could instantly clock. Bazan repeats the lines, “If I make myself friendly/Put others’ needs before my own/Don’t let my heart be hardened,” then ends “It’ll All Work Out” with one load-bearing word: “Lord.” If the hymnal lyrics, somber synth notes, and slow-boiling discordance hadn’t fully illustrated his cry of prayer, the picture is complete now.This has been Bazan’s superpower from the start. He speaks to specific experiences with the requisite references, yet he doesn’t alienate the uninitiated. The Conflicted Christian, the Struggling Addict, the Anti-Corporatist, the Angry Ex, the Disillusioned American—all complex viewpoints vividly inhabited across Pedro the Lion’s discography. But since the band’s return from a 15-year hiatus in 2019, Bazan has narrowed his framing devices. Phoenix triumphantly kicked off a planned five-album arc, pairing big, resonant guitar chords with stories of formative years spent in the titular hometown. Three years later, Havasu relaxed its grip on rock theatrics to gently explore the thrills and contradictions of being a lonely, God-fearing seventh grader. With Santa Cruz, Bazan brings the theme of life as the preacher’s kid whose family moved around a lot into tighter focus.In just over a half hour, Santa Cruz spans a decade of Bazan’s life—from eighth grade into his early 20s, and the four cities he called home during that time. The songs cover an impressive amount of ground in painstaking detail, often within just a few minutes. The title track never drops its mid-tempo pulse as Bazan breathlessly recounts his embarrassing junior high backpack, C.S. Lewis novels, and how he can’t wait to get married and have sex. He’s never sounded so much like Mark Kozelek in his delivery, especially when the glut of stanzas forces him to cram in a line off-rhythm. “Teacher’s Pet” jumps from story to unfortunate story while fleshing out a bristly ode to teenage rebellion and learning through failure. The overtly Beatles-inspired “Little Help” shares how befriending a kid from church and discovering the White Album gave him confidence among the California beach town’s surfers and skaters.Santa Cruz is packed with memories, musings, and personality, like a well-used diary covered in old stickers. But where the lyrics and themes are consistently charming, the music isn’t always. Bazan frequently uses synths in the arrangements, and their presence in some of the best songs is refreshing: Downcast and dejected, “Don’t Cry Now” revolves around a chunky arpeggio that—somewhat incredibly—sounds lifted from an old Junior Boys single. The bobbing keys and quiet guitar on album standout “Tall Pines,” at first so contained, burst to envelop Bazan’s unflinchingly measured delivery like a sudden fog. “Parting,” however, is about as middling and generic as Pedro the Lion’s indie rock gets—unfortunate given its moving story of a high school senior whose parents move once again, leaving him to finish the year in Seattle. At least when the music is less than compelling, there’s always an affecting story to follow.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

201,"The L.A. rapper’s dead-eyed hustler tales are grimier and druggier than ever. It’s a harsh toke, but the crackling production gives it the energy it needs. On F.U.N. T.O.Y., the voices surrounding Sideshow—parents, peers, pastors, sidewalk philosophers—appear between the songs like a Greek Chorus of damnation. They offer no hope or encouragement. Instead, they detail the myriad ways Sideshow and his generation are doomed. One such voice opens the record by explaining that “the young people are not gonna make it into heaven,” another issues hyper-specific death threats, and another shruggingly concedes that violence is “in his blood.” Sideshow doesn’t push back on these ideas much. His dead-eyed hustler tales indicate someone who is resigned to his fate.Sideshow has a utilitarian, disarmingly personal writing style, an approach that feels less concerned with theatrics or manipulation of language than blunt force. His verses are collections of starkly composed snapshots, brief scenes of terror or heartache rendered in vocals that suggest Boldy James and Oddisee drained of all color; even when his delivery becomes frenetic, like the paranoid flow he deploys on “Bad Friend,” his voice still moves with a slippery codeine crawl. It gives his songs a hypnotic quality, making it easy to miss brutal passages like “All my life I been stepped on/God put both feet on me/I cried, my cries they get ignored” on initial listens. There’s a thick air of inevitability in Sideshow’s work, the kind of malaise that comes from always—unfortunately—being proven right about the world.In previous albums, Sideshow’s relationship with selling and consuming drugs occupied the margins like a distant stormcloud, affecting the atmosphere without being at the center of it. Here, substances play a more central role as ubiquitous numbing agents needed to get through the day. Lean is his narcotic of choice. “I’m just tryna put a thousand dollars in one styrofoam,” he raps on “How to Kill a Man”,” following up on that thought later in the song: “Only codeine gives me purpose.”In contrast to Sideshow’s deadpan vocals, the beats he chooses are active and skittish, tumbling over themselves like loose truck tires racing down a hill. Popstar Benny’s contributions are full of colorful, pixelated synths zigzagging around plugg drums, while chameleonic Chicago producer Ayochillmannn provides shuffling, futuristic Southern funk. When combined with Sideshow’s droopy intonations, it all has a crackling, circuits-frying energy. It’s tactile; you can almost smell the frayed wiring.“Villain in Your Story (Still UA)” is a particularly harsh toke of a closer. Marc Rivera’s trudging beat is the perfect backdrop for Sideshow’s unblinking honesty (“You ain’t know I’m a fucked up dude?” he raps, less of a question than a sneer). But after 30 minutes of unrelenting darkness, Sideshow changes perspective. During a spoken-word outro, he explains that as a Black person in America, he can’t be depressed. He’s oppressed; there are systems in place designed to keep him trapped under problems engineered to be insurmountable. The bleary drug abuse, the ambient threat of violence, and the voices preaching downfall are part of a purposeful cycle. If everyone and everything around you only speaks prophecies of doom, you might eventually become a doomsayer yourself.",Rap,7.6
202,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit a foundational new age album from 1975, an alluring, slightly fried soundscape channeled directly to its composer from an inter-dimensional entity named Vista. It’s a typical scene in Marin County, the affluent expanse north of San Francisco where countless hippies settled down after the Summer of Love. Iasos leans on a deck railing as a bountiful Northern California landscape sweeps behind his lanky frame and Bob Ross perm. A trombone and mute rest beside him. Every now and then the man lets out a high-pitched giggle, not unlike Tom Hulce’s Mozart in Amadeus: appropriate given that the film spoke of Mozart’s talent as divine, and this man is steadfastly convinced that the music in his head was beamed there by an angelic, inter-dimensional entity named Vista. “I feel honored that I’m working with him,” he titters, elated as a Rolling Stone on his way back from a session with Muddy Waters.Iasos is being interviewed for a 1979 documentary by students at Marin College, four years after his debut, Inter-Dimensional Music, one of the first albums to pair new age philosophy with the glittering, celestial style of music that would soon come to bear the same name. The term initially referred to a set of unrelated movements that believed in a coming new age of spiritual enlightenment and human development—influenced by various Eastern philosophies, turn-of-the-century spiritual ideas like Theosophy, and 1950s UFO religions—many of which gained traction among the post-hippie milieu that had recently migrated to Marin. If you can sit through the Iasos interview without your eyes glazing over, you’ll hear a lot of these threads converge.Even his best friends never learned his real name, which was not made public until after his death last year. Those friends recall a happy and jocular man who wasn’t always easy to meet on an earthly plane of conversation. “Let's put it this way,” said one friend decades later. “I cannot imagine anybody less likely to come to a Super Bowl party than Iasos.”Iasos was born in 1947 in Greece to Jewish parents. His father was the only one on his side of the family to survive the Holocaust. When Iasos was four, his family moved to upstate New York, where he eventually attended Cornell University, playing in a bossa nova group called the Nova Shadow Quartet. Around this time, he started hearing what he called “paradise music” in his head, whose origin he could not trace and which he lacked the means to realize. After consulting with a psychic, he decided the music came from Vista, the Elohim of the Fifth Ray, whom he compared in interviews throughout his life to an “older brother.”",Experimental,8.3
203,"Shelved for decades and now finally released in full, Wings’ 1974 Abbey Road sessions are intimate and exploratory, showcasing a seldom heard, anything-goes side of the former Beatle. It took 52 years and an eight-hour docuseries to confirm that the recording sessions for the Beatles’ Let It Be weren’t exactly the miserable, band-killing ordeals that the namesake 1970 documentary had made them out to be. But long before Peter Jackson put a feel-good spin on the Beatles’ dying days in Get Back, Paul McCartney had already made it clear he was totally cool with having a documentary crew hovering over his shoulder during his most vulnerable moments of creation—because a mere five years after the Let It Be experience, he eagerly subjected his post-Beatles band Wings to the same cinematic scrutiny.Riding high on the runaway success of 1973’s Band on the Run, McCartney and Wings set up shop in Abbey Road Studios for four days in August 1974 and let filmmaker David Litchfield document their every move as they whipped through a sprawling setlist of recent hits, upcoming singles, B-sides, neglected album cuts, off-the-cuff medleys, instrumental jams, songs that wouldn’t be officially released until the following decade, ’50s rockabilly covers, and even a few Fab Four favorites. The result was a documentary called One Hand Clapping, whose overriding concept wasn’t so much “get back” as “get born”—an opportunity to show skeptics that Wings weren’t merely McCartney’s appendages, but a blossoming group fueled by the same sort of collaborative camaraderie and derring-do that his previous band possessed a decade prior. Alas, like the 1969 project, things didn’t go exactly as planned, and it’s taken five decades for a definitive document of the moment to see the light.From day one, Wings were burdened by a seemingly insurmountable contradiction. “For me, I like working with a gang of people, I like a little team,” McCartney told Litchfield. “I’ve never been a solo performer, so it’s natural for me to find myself a group.” Despite his stated desire to be part of a community, the fact is, no one but John Lennon could hope to be on equal creative footing with Paul McCartney in a band. In former Moody Blues member Denny Laine, McCartney found not so much a new partner as a trusted accomplice who could both fill the harmonic holes left by Lennon’s absence and flex the extra guitar muscle required in the hard-rockin’ ’70s. But even with the core of McCartney, keyboardist wife Linda, and Laine in place, Wings were always a band in flux, with different personnel appearing on each record; the triumphs of Band on the Run ultimately owed more to the trio’s crafty approach to their low-tech setup in EMI’s Lagos studio than to a proper band coming into its own.",Rock,8.4
204,"Anderson .Paak and Knxwledge’s sly, smooth-talking rap&B sounds older and wiser these days. The duo’s stellar second album layers doubt and insecurity into jet-setting antics and featherbed-plush beats. In December 2020, Anderson .Paak and Knxwledge performed at the Double Happiness festival. The show was a livestream and the artists were isolated with no audience except the camera crew. “I hate it, bro. I want the people, I want the sweat,” Paak joked. But NxWorries squeezed plenty of fun out of their barely 10-minute set. Its most striking moment made it directly onto their second album, Why Lawd? “Stop playin’ wit’ my boy Knxwledge,” Paak shouts through reverb’d vocals, hyping up early single “Where I Go,” a smooth jam that equally channels early 2000s Monica and Knx’s WrapTaypes series. When the clip appears in the album version, it sounds grandiose yet humble. Paak and Knx have toured the world, sold out arenas, and worked with plenty of larger-than-life collaborators. But that stripped-back rendition of “Where I Go” contains both the intimacy of a steamy rendezvous and the focused showmanship of a band ready to shut down a 10,000-cap room.NxWorries’ 2016 debut, Yes Lawd!, was as carefree as a new-age mack daddy rap&B album could be. The billowing thump of Knxwledge’s exhaustive backlog of beat tapes blended well with Paak’s scratchy croon-raps, somewhere between Joe Tex and Black Dynamite with a taste for vegan sausage. Eight years on, with higher individual profiles, how would NxWorries recapture that patent-leather Air Force sheen? The sumptuous Why Lawd? not only succeeds, it expands their vision. The beats are more ambitious, the lyrics more thoughtful on subjects of affection, rejection, and coital bliss. They sound as enamored with having loved and lost as with the future joys and miseries just over the horizon.Yes Lawd! came to party and dash, but Why Lawd? takes a slightly more grown approach. The first proper track “86Sentra” starts out business as usual, with Paak dangling used cars in front of love interests and rapping about playing the Super Bowl over an ominous organ loop. On “MoveOn,” he contemplates the pain he’s put himself through by living recklessly. Then, as if to put that insight to the test, “KeepHer” fleshes out the story of an ex-wife determined to leave his bullshit for a new paramour, no matter how much money he throws her way. “He don’t love you the way I—/You don’t look good in that Hyundai,” he says, before begging her for farewell sex in the next verse. It’s rewarding to see his slimeball charm turned against him: Paak is rarely, if ever, on the business end of a breakup song.",Pop,8.0
205,"At a time when dance music is pop and pop is rap and rap is emo and everything is electronic, the Los Angeles-based artist synthesizes it all into a gaudy yet distinctive sound. 2hollis is a beloved fixture in a music scene with no name. What do you call a mash of Bladee, Chief Keef, Max Martin, Skrillex, and the Geometry Dash computer game soundtrack, anyway? The 20-year-old, Los Angeles-based singer, rapper, and producer, whose real name is Hollis Frazier Herndon, makes wildly processed industrial dance pop and rap: His pyrotechnic production is the stuff of a cooped-up prodigy whose mind can’t help but move a million miles an hour.Early releases garnered a fervent internet following, his sub-Reddit and Discord channel filled with kids obsessing over his personal history, production techniques, and eerie aesthetic, which I can only describe as Roscoe Dash does medieval. His early content, though, has been scrubbed from the internet. Past projects and music videos now live via aliases and alt accounts; scrapped Instagram stories and deleted tweets are archived on fan forums. His official pages include only a sliver of his catalog, the few pictures he shares of himself a selection of highly filtered headshots. He’s hardly done any interviews, rarely posts on social media, and barely promotes his music. So why, on a niche corner of the internet, are kids calling him a messiah?Hollis didn’t come out of nowhere. His mom, Kathryn Frazier, is the founder of the PR firm Biz 3, whose roster includes the Weeknd, J. Cole, and Daft Punk. She also co-owns a record label with Skrillex, while his dad, John Herndon, was the drummer for Tortoise and releases solo music as A Grape Dope. While Hollis has likely benefited from a life spent around musicians, his work feels most influenced by internet addiction and multimedia fluency. It might be tempting to peg him as just another kid with bleach-blond hair uploading iterative computer music to SoundCloud—an offshoot of whatever it was we decided hyperpop meant. But Hollis’ latest full-length album, boy, establishes him as a remarkably distinctive, eagerly experimental savant whose sound never stalls or stagnates.Before his recent pivot to industrial dance and electropop, Hollis’ music mostly resembled that of Drain Gang stalwarts Yung Lean and Bladee, Swedish accent and all (although Hollis is from Chicago). Cloud rap suited him; his 2022 EP, As Within, So Without, made with producer kimj, features some of his best songs. Last year, when he dropped 2, an electroclash house record, the switch at first felt stark. The album is all shook-up soda and manic bravado: warp-speed synth leads and arpeggios, wet columns of bass and angsty singing, skittery four-on-the-floor drums and explosive FX. On closer inspection, Hollis’ idiosyncratic take on dance music isn’t all that different from his quirky interpolations of trap and drill. At a time when dance music is pop and pop is rap and rap is emo and everything is electronic, Hollis’ ability to swerve and synthesize his scatter-brained source material into a unique amalgam of genre-blurring music stands out. It’s an exciting development for an artist who may just be scratching the surface of his best work.",Pop,7.2
206,"On the first proper album under his solo alias, Water From Your Eyes’ Nate Amos balances self-reflection with a sly, idiosyncratic approach to DIY pop songcraft. To behold Stonehenge is to bear witness to the human capacity for ingenuity. For songwriter Nate Amos, who records as This Is Lorelei, an encounter with the megalithic structure was life-changing: It convinced him to stop smoking weed. The prospect of giving up a habit he’d indulged nearly every day for 15 years was daunting, but Amos decided to channel his subsequent restless energy into songwriting. Maybe it was the lack of weed; maybe Amos was building off the recent success of his various other projects; maybe those Neolithic rocks transmitted something magic to him—regardless, the resulting album, Box for Buddy, Box for Star, is a keenly crafted and wonderfully adventurous set of songs, both earnest and appealingly funny.Amos had his Stonehenge revelation while on tour with Water From Your Eyes, with whom he makes razor-sharp art-pop; he’s also one-half of the whimsical duo My Idea with Palberta’s Lily Konisberg. But Amos has been releasing solo music as This Is Lorelei for years, treating the alias as a catchall for experiments and unfiltered songwriting, and uploading to Bandcamp dozens of releases dating back a decade. In that way, he shares something of a musical kinship with Alex G, another prolific songwriter who got his start releasing batches of bedroom recordings on Bandcamp, and who—like Amos—combines a love for noise with Americana-ish songwriting. (As for Amos’ literal musical kinship: his father is a veteran bluegrass musician whose influence can be heard in the album’s moments of wistful twang.)Box for Buddy, Box for Star represents the first time Amos set out to write a proper This Is Lorelei album. Focusing on classic, sturdy songcraft, Amos played, sang, or sampled everything on the record himself, and his appetite is vast; there’s singer-songwriter fare, Auto-Tuned pop, sampled strings, a meditative piano interlude. Whereas Amos’ ear for detail turns Water From Your Eyes’ songs into chunks of delightful chaos, here his flourishes are more approachable, if no less deft: the big classic-rock chords that cut in after the first verse of “A Song That Sings About You,” the twinkly keys on “My Boy Limbo,” the dreamy vocal melody of “Two Legs.”His plaintive lyrics about romance and heartache have a surprisingly straightforward emotional quality. “Love, if you said you needed two legs/I’d give you mine,” he promises on “Two Legs”; on “A Song That Sings About You,” he mourns, “All these cities look the same without you.” But even in their most sincere moments, his songs are still the identifiable work of a goofball. “Dancing in the Club” features a reference to Steely Dan’s “Babylon Sisters” and a guitar riff that channels “What’s My Age Again.” (Amos claims Blink-182 “saved” him and taught him to value songs that are “fast, catchy and simple.”) The album’s opening moments sound like a curtain rising over a honky-tonk, a steel-guitar-and-strummed-chords soundtrack to a moving duet between two parting lovers—except that’s Amos singing both parts, and it’s actually a song about a cowboy who gets abducted by an angel.",Rock,7.8
207,"On her adventurous and melancholic full-length debut, the Nigerian pop star re-asserts herself as an imaginative producer and the author of her own lore. Tems was born in candlelight. “There was no electricity when my mom gave birth to me,” she told NPR. “It was night in my life for so long that, like, I just thought it was never coming.” Twenty-eight years later, the Grammy-winning Nigerian artist finds herself in the glare of the global spotlight. Born in the Wild revisits the shadows with clarity and confidence. In her earlier EPs, the Afro-fusion singer revealed her spellbinding prowess; with her debut full-length, she re-asserts herself as an imaginative producer and the author of her own lore.Tems remains her own sole songwriter, confronting the pressures of stardom through a tender, melancholic exploration of pre-fame traumas. Each song evokes a kaleidoscope of emotions, but whether addressing a higher power (“Me & U”) or reflecting on an ill-fated romance (“Unfortunate”), Tems remains focused on gratitude. On the acoustic guitar-guided opener and title track, her voice emerges as if she’s singing beside a dying campfire, piano twinkling in the sky above.Distilling her music to its essence, Born in the Wild opts for a stripped-down ’90s vibe, affording Tems the serenity to explore her innermost thoughts. Tems self-produced much of the LP alongside GuityBeatz, the Ghanaian Afropop DJ behind her 2021 EP If Orange Was a Place. The polyrhythmic soundscape, adorned with the earthy tones of conga drums, wind chimes, and shekere rattles, provides a counterweight to the homogenized sound of contemporary Afropop.In songs like “Love Me JeJe” and the Diana King-interpolating “Gangsta,” she marries vintage African music with modern R&B, dancehall, and pop, writing a love letter to the past and a message for the future. The former song is a sparkly refresh of Nigerian singer Seyi Sodimu’s 1997 call-and-response classic: “All the old heads in Nigeria, they looove this song,” she said during a recent Tiny Desk concert. “Wickedest” features a sample from Ivorian quartet Magic System’s “1er Gaou”—an iconic zouglou hit from the early aughts that triggers memories for Africans everywhere.Tems’ unembellished arrangements feel old-school and lived-in. Accompanied by jazz fusion guitarist Nsikak David on “Boy O Boy,” she conjures an ambiance of solitude as lavish as a hotel lounge ensconced in velvet. On standout “Burning,” she processes her inner turmoil in a lilting singsong, letting her vocals become the luminous core of the music. On “Forever,” which is produced by Brummie duo DAMEDAME* but sounds like a Kaytranada groove, Tems’ bassy timbre ascends to a floaty falsetto reminiscent of a young Michael Jackson. She channels 50 Cent and Lauryn Hill for the hip-hop track “T-Unit,” flexing her rap skills while staying true to the album’s melancholic mood.",Pop,7.8
208,"Behind the elegant sounds of Laurel Canyon, the Los Angeles singer-songwriter’s vivid and knotty lyrics evoke half-imagined landscapes with startling clarity. Marina Allen wields familiarity like a weapon. The Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter’s clear, quietly powerful voice sometimes recalls Carole King, sometimes Julia Holter, sometimes Maggie Rogers; her lush, Laurel Canyon-referencing production fits squarely within the ’70s folk-rock revival that’s been going on in Los Angeles for the better part of the last decade, epitomized by artists like Weyes Blood, Hand Habits, and Sam Burton. But for all the softness telegraphed in her music, Allen’s third album Eight Pointed Star is spiky and hard to pin down, its familiar environment camouflaging lyrics that can be vivid and fantastical.What other album uses the image of eating bones as a key metaphor on two separate tracks? “I eat the meat/I eat the bones,” on the rollicking country-rock song “Swinging Doors,” becomes a rousing cry of self-assuredness. On the airy, ambling “Red Cloud,” consumption becomes a way into Allen’s personal history; she makes “a stew with rain water and frozen meat, thick with pine needles, warm beer and baby teeth,” and wakes up “dizzy in Red Cloud,” the Nebraska town from which her family hails. The song’s lazy haze masks the intensity with which Allen tries to condense hundreds of years of history into a pop song, placing herself in the center of it: “I am tainted, I am taught, to be tough, to be raw, to be ruined, to be wrecked/Like the women whose aching backs and blistered skin make me coffee and burnt bread.” Beneath Allen’s laid-back compositions are lyrics that seem to scratch and claw at their seams in search of meaning.Allen’s lyrics have always been wordy—even the most accessible songs on her underrated 2022 album Centrifics, like the earwormy piano-bar tune “Or Else,” were written in long, knotty run-on sentences that stood at odds with the straightforward production. But the songs on Eight Pointed Star are more oblique and mystifying: They often take place in half-imagined, half-remembered places like the titular town in “Red Cloud” or the stretches of farmland Allen conjures on the fable-like “Bad Eye Opal.” Much of the album is ostensibly about Allen finding a sense of confidence—in art, in relationships, or in herself—and that confidence, true to the adage that the more you learn the less you know, results in songs that plant themselves firmly in life’s gray areas.Even so, Allen stumbles upon complex truths that she delivers with steely resolve. Opener “I’m the Same,” a piece of serene, spacious Americana, at first seems so placid that it’s unrecognizable as a breakup song. But that calmness feels in line with Allen’s rebukes to a partner, which are frank and cutting in their clarity: “Feeling wronged is not the same as proof,” she sings, delivering the line with the casualness of someone who knows they’re in the right. It’s a rare moment of certainty, and by the record’s last song, “Between Seasons,” all she’s sure of is that change can be a great thing. It feels like a mirror image of “I’m the Same”: Instead of chastising a partner for not seeing her fully, she revels in the feeling of growth. But the final line, once again, is a rug pull that suggests uncertainty can be one of life’s great joys, a quasi-mantra that reverberates through the rest of Eight Pointed Star: “Right on track, getting lost.”All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

209,"Spotlighting over a dozen vocalists on a suite of airy, upbeat collaborations, the Canadian producer’s big mainstream moment showcases his slick sound in a variety of different settings. Time was, producers could keep secrets. Samples and drum kits were subjects of intense speculation, while draconian copyright laws pushed crate-diggers deep into obscure backlists. Equipment was expensive and quickly outdated; studio time cost $200 an hour. But Kaytranada arrived in the era of demystified production, with advanced engineering tools and infinite audio libraries mere clicks away. In developing his signature sound, he focused less on discrete elements—his peers could replicate those anyway—than their intricate arrangement. On his 2016 breakthrough, 99.9%, the tempos, syncopation, and layering techniques were Kaytranada’s own, even when the instrumentals and melodies came from elsewhere.By now, you know a Kaytranada beat when you hear one: The drums are foregrounded with a papery rasp, loud but rarely abrasive. His is such a specific trademark that he risked reaching an artificial ceiling if each record was just an iteration of a theme. 2023’s Kaytraminé preempted any stagnation, pairing Kaytranada’s kinetic drum patterns with Aminė’s chatty rhymes, keeping the temperature low while indulging a shared nervousness. On Timeless, Kaytranada builds on the fusion of 99.9% and 2019’s Bubba, spotlighting over a dozen vocalists on a suite of airy, upbeat collaborations.True to form, Timeless is structured and sequenced like a DJ set as finely chopped instrumentals cross-fade into the next. The jazzier numbers, like “Video” and “Stepped On,” have a mathematical precision reminiscent of Kaytranada’s earlier work with Robert Glasper. And while the songs themselves lack big dynamic trajectories, the tracklist orbits around “Drip Sweat,” a climactic fireworks display featuring Channel Tres. The simplistic melody recalls early-’90s claustrophobia, augmented by Kaytranada’s stuttering rhythm breaks. Channel Tres leans into his role as a glowering emcee, directing dancefloor traffic between muttered verses.Timeless is a dance record, but it can be easily adapted for kicking back at home. The busy drum patterns are offset by soft chords and engineering—the whispery snares land like an air conditioner’s muffled rattle. Kaytranada’s touch is also accentuated by a corps of fluttery-voiced R&B stars: Tinashe and Ravyn Lenae are flanked by Canadian counterparts Rochelle Jordan and Charlotte Day Wilson, grounding the electronica with more classic phrasing. On “Still,” Kaytranada’s heavy kicks propel Wilson’s wistful ballad; the rimshots scattered throughout “Hold On” contrast Dawn Richard’s smooth vocals with spiky edges. The intersection recalls a late-’00s moment when hip-hop producers like Dela and DJ Jazzy Jeff were huffing neo-soul’s last fumes, dousing their rustling MPC drums with turntable cuts—a short interim bookended by more decisive movements, condensing techniques drawn from disparate, bygone eras.And that’s what makes a good DJ set—there’s a little something for everybody. On Timeless, Afrobeat rhythms and funk licks are dressed in R&B elegance; Childish Gambino and PinkPantheress meet the lively tempos with alacrity. If anything, the parade of blends and collaborations dulls the record’s highlights. A winking and mischievous Anderson .Paak supplies the album’s most charismatic performance on “Do 2 Me.” Don Toliver echoes .Paak’s vocal register on “Feel a Way,” yet it’s missing the sly intimacy, bogging down the set’s breezy opening passage.An angsty Thundercat duet, “Wasted Words,” is limited to 90 seconds and buried on a bonus disc. Over Kaytranada’s hypnotic shuffle, Thundercat scales into falsetto, lambasting his neighbors (“You need to take that hat off/’Cause your whole ‘fit is trash”) for innocuous offenses. It’s a bit out-of-place on Timeless, yet the moody chords and harmonies are tantalizing in context, exposing a tiny hole in the record’s block-party itinerary. But if Timeless feels slighter than its predecessors, it’s no less assured, its purpose no less profound: to get you moving, even in quiet moments.",Pop,7.3
210,"The Austin band’s knowing, sharply rendered indie rock filters life on the road into songs about interpersonal angst and heartland unease. It’s rough out there for lots of indie rock bands, but Austin’s Good Looks have really been through the shit. The day after they released their 2022 debut, Bummer Year, guitarist Jake Ames was nearly killed in a hit-and-run. The band put off touring while he slowly recovered, and when they did finally hit the road, their van caught fire and they lost everything: gear, instruments, laptops, merch, personal effects, everything. A less committed group might have taken either of these tragedies as a sign from the universe, but to their credit Good Looks are a foolhardy lot. While they don’t address those trials on their follow-up, Lived Here for a While, they play like their lives depend on it.Lived Here for a While views the world from a blazing tour van. These songs aren’t just about what they see out on the road, but what they leave behind. Lovers grow distant, friends fade away, cities expand beyond recognition. “This used to be a Black neighborhood,” frontman Tyler Jordan exclaims on “White Out”, and few songwriters could make gentrification sound so deftly (or wittily: “Look out! They’re jogging! and they’re bringing their dogs with ’em!”). Whenever they tour, they never return to exactly where they left, which churns up a sense of unease in these songs: The tempos are just a little too fast; the guitars bypass jangle and head straight for the jitters.Too often, indie self-awareness can come across as self-regarding and off-putting, like a novel about how hard it is to be a novelist. How many listeners can relate to tales of long hauls and empty venues? To their credit, Good Looks never whine about their fortunes, nor do they sound like they’re playing exclusively to other touring indie rock bands. Jordan makes it all relatable, as though touring were no different than any other low-paying gig in late-capitalist America. And he knows that lovers and spouses typically take the brunt of any artist’s frustrations. Jordan is an ambitious songwriter—and occasionally a messy one, as on “Self-destructor,” which lapses into condescension—but songs like “If It’s Gone” and especially “Desert” are distinguished by their generosity toward their subjects. Jordan apologizes rather than throws blame, and hopes it’ll make him a better man. As he sings on “Vaughn,” “Not every single lover has gotta be a sad song.”Jordan was singing about these subjects on Bummer Year, but these new songs are more acute in their angst, more vivid in their arrangements, more volatile in their performances. As resourceful a songwriter as Jordan may be—with a casual lyricism that can turn a plainspoken phrase into a lighter-raising chorus—Good Looks were never merely his backing band. Racing through “Self-destructor” and churning up drama in “Why Don’t You Believe Me?,” they take the curves a little too fast, but the rhythm section’s taut krautrock beats keep all tires on the pavement. And Ames always has a punchy riff on hard, or a trenchant guitar tone, or a blast of feedback to bolster Jordan’s vocals or wryly undercut him. Self-referential yet also self-critical, they play every song like it’s an argument for why they’re playing that song.",Rock,7.5
211,"Crazed, noisy, and barely finished, the New York rapper’s latest tape digs into his mad mind and hypnotic sound. Nobody combines serrated rap and goofy hi-jinks like Xaviersobased. In “Pediatrician,” Xavier flashes back to his kiddie days watching Noggin at the doc’s office, wearing KidRobot clothing and a SpongeBob wallet in hand, while producer mag blasts some Satan-with-IBS low-end in the “terror bass” style. The surreal combo of cute youthful references and aggro intensity is bizarrely addictive. Adorned with just enough pretty keys and airy cymbals, it throws you into a blissed trance. While January’s Keep It Goin Xav felt like a triumphant celebration of the scene surrounding his collective 1c34, with 2 goes solo and injects this kind of dazed-yet-hyper rap with a new level of screwy psychedelia.Xavier teased with 2 so many times that it started to feel like it would never arrive. When the tape finally dropped last week, it was because someone leaked it. So Xavier just put it out himself, even though it wasn’t properly mixed yet. But this kind of crazed, barely-finished release moment is perfect for his music anyway, since it often has the feverish rawness of disheveled snippets.If 2021’s With felt like a demolition zone of abrasive distortion, this sequel is more like a laboratory gone mad. The woozy freakiness remains, but the spiky edge has been softened. Cavernous drums echo over lost-in-reverie synth keys and vocals laced with so much delay Xavier floats through the tracks like a benevolent phantom. His wispy flow on “You See Me” coils upward like he’s slowly ascending a spiral staircase into the clouds. Yet even at its dreamiest, shards of sadness poke through. “linda.mp3” feels like mourning and moonwalking at the same time. Warm rays of synth drape Xavier as he pleads with another artist to quit drinking lean.While the tape delivers a sizable supply of hypnotic delights, there’s not much in the way of wild surprises. nyli and xion’s twitchy-twinkly beat for highlight “what zit tooya” already appeared in a Nettspend and phreshboyswag song, and straightforward tracks like “jaded” and “Softer” sound like they could’ve been on any xaviersobased tape in the last few years. Xavier’s at his best when leaning into unstable, erratic confrontations, as on “Aight,” whose bassline brawls with the synths like Greek Gods defending Mt. Olympus. The track was produced by cranes and anarchy, a talented Florida teen who offers a glimpse of the next generation beyond Xavier: cosmically unhinged and glitch-wracked stuff that takes distorted rap as a starting point.Despite a lowkey surge in popularity since Keep It Goin Xav, he’s still disgorging tapes that feel like DIY community zines, packed with madcap thumbnails and an all-star roster of niche producers. Nothing is out of bounds: chitchat about studying in the “1c library,” sounds of mouse clicks, or heaven-high gurgles. Violent threats and moments of emo vulnerability collide with cover art of a scowling purple fish from SpongeBob named “Mr. What Zit Tooya.” As other new-generation SoundCloud upstarts dilute their sound for wider audiences, it’s sweet to watch someone who doesn’t give a fuck. Even if it doesn’t hit all the time, the vision is thrilling.",Rap,7.6
212,"The Colombian producer’s galaxy-sized rave tracks are unsettling and exhilarating. This 21-minute EP is an essential record for the vanguard of dance music. Verraco and his peers in Medellín, Colombia once presented themselves as rave revolutionaries: guerillas rising up to topple a hegemonic club culture and wrest electronic music from the Global North’s death grip. They called their label Insurgentes; its inaugural release, Verraco’s debut EP, was titled Resistir. But over the past seven years, Verraco (aka JP López) and his crew have grown from upstarts into some of the most feted names in the underground, kingpins of a scene that onlookers have dubbed—somewhat problematically—“Latin club.”Yet Verraco has never been one to be pigeonholed. True, he deployed cumbia rhythms on the 2020 song “Breaking Hegemonies” and sampled the iconic Zapatista spokesman Subcomandante Marcos on “Hasta morir si es preciso.” Releases on his label TraTraTrax, a successor to Insurgentes, are awash in Caribbean dembow, Venezuelan raptor house, Mexican tribal techno, and other sounds from across Latin America and the diaspora. But TraTraTrax refuses to be pinned to any identity but the one that the community has invented for itself: The label described 2022’s no pare, sigue sigue—the closest thing the scene has had to a manifesto—as a “popurrí,” a mixture of “everything and nothing, just sudaca bangers loaded with flavour and resentment, but above all, resentment, because we don’t want our wounds to heal.”Verraco’s music is equally informed by the brain-bending sounds of Aphex Twin, Autechre, and other UK electronic pioneers, along with the psychedelia of artists like James Holden and the darkside electro of Rotterdam and The Hague. This is also a kind of resistance, a way of reminding worldwide audiences that López has as much claim to the Euro-American techno canon as any white kid in Ohio or Heidelberg. After the relative abstraction of his 2020 album Grial, Verraco dropped his heaviest, most triumphantly unbridled work yet with last year’s storming and altogether unorthodox Escándaloo, a double-barreled shot across club music’s bow; now, on Breathe… Godspeed, he breaks out even bigger guns. The four tracks bear some relationship to other contemporary Latin club anthems in their chugging rhythms and severe sonics, but in their sheer, intransigent weirdness, they sound little like anything else—from anywhere at all.Rather than any given style, Verraco’s work is defined by its intensity—overdriven synths, distorted percussion, violently gyrating oscillators—and the epic scale of his arrangements, which often sound less like club tracks than galactic battle-march hymns. Both qualities are in ample supply on these four tracks, which feel like a single overarching suite. They share a palette of muscular drums, digitally abraded textures, and wildly disorienting sound design. Nothing is what it seems: Basslines growl like cyborg beasts, while processed voices—jabbering and chattering indecipherably—might be mischievous aliens. The mood is exhilarating but unsettling; both the intricate patterning and ambiguous air of malice remind me of the geometric landscapes and “machine elves” described by many DMT users. Verraco’s tracks report from an alternate dimension of club music, where even the most familiar trope is made thrillingly strange.",Electronic,8.2
213,"Composed during an extended flow state, the UK avant-techno producer’s hypnotic new album balances murky, lo-fi dread with moments of shimmering beauty. An apprehensive energy charges the atmosphere just before a thunderstorm erupts. The light seems wrong, shadows washed out by the flat, sickly greenish hue of the sky. You can feel the air thinning as the barometric pressure drops, preparing for the coming gusts of wind and spiky torrents of rain or hail. Those moments seem to last forever, stretching time taut until the storm finally arrives, offering a respite from the tension.That nervous, clenched-jaw feeling saturates the beguiling Statik, Darren Cunningham’s latest album as Actress. It’s a soft and unsettling record, quietly off-gassing its paranoid aura like a decaying piece of fruit in a well-appointed kitchen. Even the album’s most beautiful passages—and there are many—move with an anxious slink, as if Cunningham had composed these tracks while hunched over, eyes darting, his shoulders brushing his ears. The majority of Statik came from an unbroken period of productivity Cunningham describes as an “extensive flow state,” and that deep focus gives it a cohesion that some of his previous records lacked. Each song seems to grow out of the preceding one, like a coral reef blossoming into a strange and singular world.Cunningham conceals most of his sounds beneath a blanket of hiss, smudging everything into a blurry haze. He’ll often use sidechain compression to carve out kick drums, giving them the effect of railroad signals strobing on a foggy night. There’s a pervasive dreamlike atmosphere, as if each instrument is being played in a different space, all traveling significant distances to arrive in your headphones. The initial ambient moments of “System Verse” glimmer like light pollution on the horizon, wispy synth pads floating around a murky bass rhythm. As the song fades in, it feels as though it’s slowly—almost menacingly—approaching, coalescing into a muted but propulsive 140 BPM techno track. It can be difficult to compute exactly what’s happening at any given time on Statik, even if the elements are generally familiar.A disorienting amount of tension yields very little resolution. The squirming synthesizer sequences in “Ray” overlap but never seem to touch each other, their circular standoff egged on by the insistent click of 16th-note hi-hats. “Cafe del Mars” features a delirious cascade of arpeggios accented by a string synth, building anticipation for a chord change that never comes. When Cunningham does offer a break from the pressure, he tends to bury it deep in the mix. The gentle flanged guitar melody on “Dolphin Spray” softens the song’s staccato edge, but you have to strain to make it out. Any moments of serenity are fleeting, at constant risk of being overshadowed by the looming dread.",Electronic,7.9
214,"On her debut album, the New York singer-songwriter grapples with the big feelings and small details of young adulthood over appropriately cinematic backdrops. Sometimes you go through a breakup and feel like you could just wither away; sometimes you read the news and are reminded that one day, the sun really will just wither away. Regardless of their respective scales, both problems can feel equally real. But the collision of these micro and macro heartaches can be destabilizing. “If I change my life/Will I die?” singer-songwriter Margaux Bouchegnies, who performs mononymously as Margaux, wonders on her debut album, Inside the Marble, pondering quandaries both personal and existential against dreamy, imaginative soundscapes.Bouchegnies is a recent graduate of the New School; since finishing her studies, she’s become a fixture in the Brooklyn music scene, touring as a bassist with acts like Katy Kirby and Dougie Poole. Inside the Marble was crafted in the throes of that uncertain moment when the structures of academia fall away and you’re thrust into the so-called real world. It builds on her debut EP, 2019’s More Brilliant Is the Hand That Throws the Coin, which established her as an artist who could deftly capture the tumult of young love. You can hear the fruits of her coursework in her songwriting; she quotes Susan Sontag on More Brilliant’s “Faced With Fire,” and later released a set of songs inspired by the life and work of Emily Dickinson.Bouchegnies has said that Inside the Marble is about “making sense of big feelings,” and she constructs appropriately cinematic backdrops for each of them. The moody “Midnight Contact” starts downbeat and minimalist, then builds to dizzying heights; it sounds like it could soundtrack the moment in a coming-of-age film where the wistful protagonist makes a life-altering decision. The songs are layered and dense—Bouchegnies plays guitar, bass, Mellotron, glockenspiel, Farfisa, Wurlitzer, and piano, while producer Sahil Ansari adds percussion and tape loops; other collaborators contribute trombone, violin, and clarinet. The arrangements are lush and naturalistic, filled with charming, well-placed details: the swooping strings on “Picture It,” a touch of pedal steel on “Dissolve / Resolve,” ghostly backing vocals on “Sadie Something.” The overall effect, though, remains surprisingly gentle, thanks in large part to Bouchegnies’ voice, which floats above the arrangements and rarely ever strays from its steady, self-assured delivery.Her emotions range from the quotidian to the universal. On “Ships,” heartbreak is like a storm at sea, threatening to knock her overboard; later, on “Make the Move,” she’s reaching toward new love, sounding positively smitten over plucked acoustic guitar and steady percussion. On propulsive tracks like “Picture It” and “Sadie Something,” she contemplates time’s endless march towards oblivion: “Everybody/One by one takes/Off into the great unknown,” she declares on the latter. Intellectually, we might understand that not all anxieties (the social awkwardness she details on “What Could I Say?” or the what-am-I-doing-with-my-life paralysis of “I Can’t Decide”) are equally consequential. But it doesn’t always feel that way—especially in young adulthood, when our norms and values still have some settling in to do. It’s charming to hear Bouchegnies consider all these big feelings deeply, drawing an entire universe out of them before moving on, curiously and carefully, to the next.",Folk,7.1
215,"The South London band’s third album combines subtle garage-pop grooves and clanging noise-rock for the most full and refined version of the Goat Girl experience. Goat Girl are a balancing act, really. The London art rock trio tempered references to cyanide with wry melodies on their eponymous 2018 debut album, and they used cool synths to make having scabies sound more chill on 2021’s On All Fours. Their third album, Below the Waste, once more pilfers the garbage can for inspiration—entrails and mud are some featured lyrics—but they’re not as explicit as they used to be. Now, the band’s mastery of balance lies mostly in their production. Below the Waste welds Goat Girl’s scrap-metal clanging to the more subtle garage-pop groove of On All Fours, creating a more refined version of the band’s music. They’re jumping into filth, and doing it with style.To commemorate the occasion, the band seems to have dropped their Throbbing Gristle-type monikers. Singer Clottie Cream has turned back into Lottie Pendlebury, bassist Holly Hole has closed and formed Holly Mullineaux, and drummer Rosy Bones welcomes Rosy Jones. Shedding even this thin layer of artifice, with co-production help from black midi engineer John “Spud” Murphy, reflects the band’s fresh interest in analog sounds.Some of Below the Waste’s most exhilarating moments come from a textural mishmash of orchestral arrangements and the steely glam of synths. A plucked guitar continually cracks the TV static surface of “words fell out” like a faraway bird popping through the clouds, and it softens Pendlebury’s vocal delivery, which has some Tori Amos or red-wine dryness. “perhaps” thickens her voice with a drunken clarinet melody, deepening the phone anxiety she sings about. The flute that comes later is beautiful, but no match for a drooling guitar line’s growing darkness. All of these sounds fight for space in the songs and build an infectious tension throughout the record.Through these exciting layers, Goat Girl pad Below The Waste with luxurious fullness, occasionally to the album’s detriment. At 16 songs, Below the Waste returns Goat Girl to 2018, when their debut album floundered in its 19-song bloat. Two of Below the Waste’s instrumental interludes, “s.m.o.g.” and “prelude,” sound like lo-fi guitar tuning, and they don’t counter or contribute much to the album’s lithe energy. But, for the rest of its runtime, Below the Waste’s decadent production holds your attention. We hear Pendlebury sigh in infinity circles on “pretty faces,” as if she’s continuously collapsing on the song’s decadent mattress of strings, and it builds our suspense for the coming breakdown: a small windstorm of groaning, chorus pads, and stuttering violin.While most of Below the Waste’s songs value symmetry in their lush instrumentation and vocal harmonies, it’s thrilling when one overtakes the other. Most of the frantic and fed-up “tcnc” sounds completely swallowed by an earthquake, with synth buzzing through everything like a passing train. On the opposite end, a stabby, brassy keyboard hook guides us down the listless “motorway” like a row of buttons, but Pendlebury’s sleep-deprived vignettes—“Called out shotgun/Motion sickness/Road to nowhere”—make it careful and romantic. This ability to summon intensity without a lyrical shock factor is new for Goat Girl, and they’re better for it.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

216,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit Ice Cube’s 1990 debut solo record, a groundbreaking piece of hard and funky reality rap that introduced the tabloid decade. Ronald Reagan knew television. Broadcasting since the birth of the medium, he always understood exactly how he looked on the other side of the camera. He used TV to cast himself as a kindly septuagenarian who loved jelly beans and playing cowboy, while his aides prepped him not with foreign policy debriefings but by telling him what to do in a particular “scene.” His major political battles were waged by the combined force of law and the mass media against enemies foreign (the Soviet Union) and domestic (the poor, especially Black).Throughout the decade, a credulous, ratings-hungry TV news media used Reagan’s “law and order” style of right-wing governance to cast young Black men as the nation’s primary criminal menace, known mainly by their Action News poses, described by Ice Cube on “Rollin’ Wit the Lench Mob”: “On my knees in the street /Interlock my hands and feet.” Los Angeles made a great staging ground for Reagan’s so-called war on drugs, and in 1989 the hardline, media-savvy LAPD Chief Daryl Gates invited Nancy Reagan (and a phalanx of TV reporters) to observe a staged raid on a suspected dealer. “The working press arrived to find Mrs. Reagan and Gates munching fruit salad in an air-conditioned motor home parked beside the alleged rock house,” reported the L.A. Times.By the early 1980s, television had replaced the daily newspaper as the nation’s primary news medium. Increasingly, the cultural relevance or accepted truth of an event was only fully acknowledged once video surfaced on the nightly news, or an evening TV drama ripped the story from the headlines. TV’s unique capacity to absorb, juxtapose, and regurgitate current events through pre-existing genres and cutting-edge visuals would soon come to be characterized as “postmodern,” but a more useful term came from critic Todd Gitlin, who described ’80s TV programming as the ultimate “recombinant” platform. Writing in 1983 of TV shows and films mimicking the increasingly torrid pace of Reagan’s unregulated late-capitalist consumerism, Gitlin explained that “in a world stripped of transcendent unities, the strategy of collage, of juxtaposition, makes the best of a bad situation,” in which “order can be assembled only from the juxtaposition of shards.”Pop music had been juxtaposing shards into new forms for decades by this point, and no form was doing so more virtuosically than hip-hop, whether via DJs looping rhythmic breaks or rappers adopting outlandish personae and shuffling through pop culture references. As hip-hop became more political, rappers started mimicking the news reporters who were constantly prowling around their neighborhoods. In 1982, Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five’s “The Message” opened with Melle Mel braying a tabloid headline about the shards he saw all around him: “Broken glass, everywhere!” A year later, Run-D.M.C. debuted with their own form of recombinant street journalism by flipping Walter Cronkite’s epochal and confident CBS Evening News signoff—“And that’s the way it is”—to a mordant slogan for young Black no-hopers at the dawn of Reaganism: “It’s like that/And that’s the way it is.” A few years later, Public Enemy frontman Chuck D—who was born in 1960 and came of age during the peaks of Black Power and 1970s Black television—took the metaphor to its logical conclusion, telling Spin that “rap is Black America’s TV station,” a medium that “gives a whole perspective of what exists and what Black life is about.”",Rap,9.0
217,"The Los Angeles composer—son of late Fluxus composer Yoshi Wada—flexes his avant-garde instincts on a surprisingly song-driven new album, moving from abstraction into more expressive forms. Tashi Wada was born into the avant-garde. Growing up in a building shared by Fluxus artists, Wada lived next door to the choreographer Simone Forti. Video artist Nam June Paik was in the apartment upstairs. His father, legendary composer Yoshi Wada, worked as a plumber by day and an artist by night, stretching the limits of minimalism by incorporating Scottish bagpipes and Indian ragas. Tashi’s own work is rarely described without reference to those pioneering drones, but he shrugs off questions about paternal influence. “Sometimes I have a sense of how my work is perceived in relation to my father’s, but I tend to limit my understanding to my own personal space and how I feel about it,” he said in a 2019 interview. “I leave the rest to the world to sort out.”While the younger Wada’s musical output is certainly related to the elder’s, it’s no imitation. Yoshi tended toward grand gestures, recording bagpipes in an empty swimming pool or composing for startlingly loud auditory flares normally used for nautical emergencies. Tashi is more academic, preferring to generate microtones with unusual tuning systems rather than through massive volume. After studying with James Tenney, he forged a link between the Fluxus movement and a newer generation of artists centered around the CalArts music program. The 2018 album Nue, credited to Tashi Wada with Yoshi Wada and Friends, represented a passing of the torch: Yoshi and Forti featured alongside CalArts alums Julia Holter and Corey Fogel. With What Is Not Strange?, Wada takes the next step, moving from the periphery of his father’s community to the center of his own and demonstrating a newfound maturity as a composer in the process.The biggest surprise here is that Wada has written honest-to-goodness songs, albeit rather strange ones. This shift is due in part to life events that drew him away from abstraction and toward more expressive forms. In the years after Nue, Yoshi passed away and Tashi had a child with Holter, his partner. “Grand Trine,” a sprightly chamber-pop number, celebrates their daughter. Its title refers to three planets forming an equilateral triangle on her astrological chart, but the trio of father, mother, and daughter is clearly the song’s subject. “She is my star,” Holter croons over elegant harpsichord and strings. The instrumentation leaps to abrupt climaxes only to fade away again and again, like surges of joy that dissipate only to return with renewed vigor. But the mood is troubled in the following song, “Revealed Night,” which is built on an urban field recording of sirens in the distance, evoking the pandemic into which she was born.",Rvng,7.8
218,"With her sixth album, Charli XCX transcends all narratives and delivers a hit. BRAT is imperious and cool, nuanced and vulnerable, and one of the best pop albums of the year. It’s the era of the relatable pop star, where the Machiavellian hustlers of the music industry A-list write songs about being as unlucky and confused as you and I. These days, the world’s biggest musicians are apparently also the salt of the earth, perpetually downtrodden by their relationships or jobs. They’re down bad but they’re doing the work, jamming the radio with songs about setting boundaries or learning their moon sign. And have you heard? Their latest album is their most vulnerable to date, despite the public’s seeming allergy to moral ambiguity and the sense that it’s been years since anyone was remotely honest about their motivations. Are you having fun yet?Meanwhile, Charli XCX has been dreaming of a time when the It Girls were hot messes, flashing the paparazzi as they tumbled from the Chateau or looking feral outside Les Deux at 4 a.m. on a Tuesday. The Bimbo Summit’s on her mood board, as are the neon-splattered club nights of the mid- to late-2000s, back when dance music was in its bedroom-producer phase and pop singers were still divas who’d never condescend that they were anything like you. It’s a vibe that’s rather popular as of late. (Oh, to be a creative director tasked with explaining “indie sleaze” to Camila Cabello.) But Charli lived it, albeit as an English teenager whose MySpace demos had titles like “Art Bitch,” raging vicariously through the blogosphere.BRAT, the sixth album from the 31-year-old songwriter, has roots in this stretch of the aughts, which holds a tenuous claim to the last IRL gasp of “alternative culture” before it moved into our phones. It’s also a reaction, as Charli’s records tend to be: to the focus-grouped monotony of playlist-fodder pop, the tedium of our current “authenticity” obsession, and to her previous album, 2022’s Crash, which posed the question: “What might it sound like if I did sell out?” If you read trendy literature or spend much time on “X,” you might recognize the mode of defensive self-awareness, pre-empting the possibility of sounding like an idiot or looking like a flop. That album—on which she utilized for the first time in a decade the A&R services of her label, Atlantic Records—was her first to top the UK Albums Chart. But it lacked the culture-shifting oomph of a Vroom Vroom or Pop 2, records that felt like risks that no one else would take. Joining their category and transcending it, BRAT arrives as the best-sounding version of the Charli XCX promise to make the Apollonian pop landscape Dionysian again.",Pop,8.6
219,"Crowd-pleasing anthems come naturally to the Korean superstar DJ. If only her debut album had more of them. Has any DJ played the game quite like Peggy Gou? Plenty of DJs are influencers, but it’s rare they have a catalog of stylish deep house 12""s to their name. Some are fashion models, but have they been on multiple covers of Vogue, Dazed, Elle, and Harper’s Bazaar? There’s always that one percent of superstar DJs bopping between Vegas, Ibiza, and Dubai on their private jets—but only one of them is a 32-year-old Korean woman who insists on managing herself.Gou has gone from zero to 500 mph in the years since she swapped a fashion career for dance music, ticking off every conceivable goal for a rising celebrity DJ: the first Korean woman to play Berghain, headline sets at Ibiza’s superclubs, a crossover hit on a cool indie, a clothing line backed by Virgil Abloh, a Kylie Minogue remix to promote three new flavors of Magnum ice cream. Most impressively, last year she released “(It Goes Like) Nanana,” a frothy ’90s house bagatelle that went to No. 1 in five countries and has been streamed nearly 500 million times. This is not the sort of thing that happens to DJs, unless their name is Diplo, David Guetta, or Calvin Harris.Now, eight years after her first single, she releases her debut album on XL Recordings, home to big-league dance acts from the Prodigy to Overmono. Drawing heavily on the ’90s club music that Gou says “changed her taste” during lockdown, I Hear You operates in the same mode of retro fantasia that generated “Nanana,” cherry-picking iconic sounds from house music’s ’80s and ’90s heyday. In rough historical order, we’ve got glassy Italo synths, super-sized syndrums, pumping organs, plasticky MIDI horns, the fierce thwack of the TR-909, several saggy breakbeats, and one tasty jungle loop.Gou is good at stirring up rosy nostalgia for some long-lost Disco Europa, a mood that strikes a chord with a generation longing for the imagined freedom and optimism of dance music’s golden era. Her breakout tracks—2018’s “It Makes You Forget (Itgehane)” and “Han Jan”—were defined by their space, restraint, and melody. What they lacked in over-ratcheted builds and drops they made up for in cosmic detailing: bongos, twinkling bells, aquatic basslines, and a uniquely dreamy femininity imparted by Gou’s faux-naive speak-singing in a mixture of Korean and English. I Hear You strikes a frustrating standoff between these two versions of Gou: It lacks the authentic quirkiness of those earlier hits, yet never lets loose the confetti cannons and fishbowl cocktails promised by “Nanana.”",Electronic,6.2
220,"The singer-songwriter’s second album is a well-curated coming-of-age tale. Full of summery R&B and glitzy amapiano, it moves beyond feel-good anthems and thoughtfully tackles the insecurities of young adulthood. Before Ayra Starr even turned 21, she had already graduated college, signed with the powerhouse West African label Mavin, and dropped her debut album, 19 & Dangerous. Her second LP, The Year I Turned 21, is the next chapter in her pop stardom storybook. While 19 & Dangerous spotlit an angsty Ayra jaded by toxic, past relationships, TYIT21 captures a Grammy-nominated Starr fixated on getting the bag. This new Ayra might be dripping in designer, but there’s an underlying vulnerability that grounds her. Not straying far from her signature sound, Starr’s well-curated album explores introspective depths and thankfully journeys beyond feel-good anthems.In the lead single “Commas,” the Beninese Nigerian singer-songwriter credits her success to God, radiating a gracious spirituality that floats through the album. Money is a recurring motif: “To be real I’m still eating off my last hit,” she raps breathlessly, then lets the words settle into the gospel-tinged choir of “Bad Vibes.” What initially sounds like a flex suddenly feels existential. Starr’s reflections on money bounce between moments of gratitude, reminders of the hustle, and an insatiable desire for more, painting a far richer picture of a young woman grappling with adulthood. On “1942,” she stammers, “I don’t wanna lose”; the worry feels especially palpable when Milar, Ayra’s brother, interjects that he’s scared he might “lose it all” one day. The line hints at insecurities Starr might hesitate to voice herself. Here lies the driving force of TYIT21: the fear of everything you’ve worked for suddenly vanishing into thin air.Turning 21 is both a milestone and trope, but Starr’s portrayal across the record feels refreshingly complicated, filled with contradictions and uncertainties. She sparkles on “21,” a heartfelt meditation that wrestles with the weight of self-definition. The woozy ballad thrives in its dreamy simplicity, allowing Starr to explore the lush textures of her voice; breathy croons and spoken word morph into full-bodied belts. Her musical alchemy makes R&B’s flow and Afrobeats’ rhythmic pulse groove in unison, rendering her voice a natural fit for more traditional ballads. It’s an internal monologue between youthful optimism and being comfortable not knowing it all. “21” fades on the soft refrain of the word “22,” a chilling lullaby turned cosmic nightmare.Despite her undeniable growth over the last two years, Starr’s words still read like a diary. This album basks in the greenness of youth. From the violin-guided opener “Birds Sing of Money,” Starr puts up an IDGAF front, spitting, “I don’t watch my tone cause I like how it sound bitch,” a cheeky swerve from her softer, rose-colored lyrics. “Lagos Love Story” is an Afropop sugar rush that revels in the thrill of a young romance—the kind of love that leads to impulsive promises after a day of smoking weed at the beach (“Let’s make babies, we’re still young but I dey ready,” she proposes). Three tracks later, Starr has prematurely declared her “Last Heartbreak Song” in a duet with Giveon. Who’s going to break it to her that this is only the beginning?",Pop,7.6
221,"After a decade of searching for the intersection of hip-hop and country and a star turn on Cowboy Carter, the Virginia-born singer finds much more than a party on his third album. In mid-April, after struggling for a decade to find a new intersection between country and hip-hop, Shaboozey released “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” amid the wave of adulation that followed Cowboy Carter, the Black country maypole on which he appeared twice. It seemed like the epitome of a one-hit wonder. A near-universal anthem about despising your job that barely begets survival and drowning in as many rounds as the bartender can summon, it became a near-universal sensation, streaming three million times in 24 hours and charting all around the world. After all, how could a whistle-out-loud interpolation of a 20-year-old J-Kwon smash that nodded to the Black roots of Jack Daniels while towering atop the lily-white country chart not be a flash in the pan, some glitch in the Music Row matrix? This was surely Shaboozey’s “Achy Breaky Heart” and “Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell,” his mainstream introduction and farewell all at once.But Where I’ve Been, Isn’t Where I’m Going does not feel like a mere receptacle for one of the year’s most unlikely hits. Shaboozey’s remarkably assured third album is a sophisticated self-help journey that only occasionally masquerades as a good time. He has spent a long while trying to find some space where the sounds of hip-hop and country could overlap, where the defiant swagger, nostalgic circumspection, and quivering heartbreak of both genres could fuse together. The parties of “A Bar Song” and “Drink Don’t No Mix” offer the same sort of escapes that he suggests in “East of the Massanutten” or “Let It Burn,” where the Great American West becomes the frontier for fleeing, respectively, the persecutions of the South or an abusive relationship. Shaboozey seems to always be asking how we can last a little longer and live a little better in this strange place, even as he’s grinning while reaching for another shot.If you’re the type of listener who writes off the last dozen years of mainstream country music, especially its best-selling bro-country core, as bullshit, Where I’ve Been will at first sound like a tough hang. He uses Auto-Tune to exaggerate the contours of his drawl during cowboy-coopting opener “Horses & Hellcats,” a trick he nevertheless smartly returns to. He favors processed, billowing harmonies that emphasize his epiphanies, as on “Highway,” the frustrated testimonial of a traveler almost broken by the choices that make him alone. And he inches toward rap, his voice oozing over the second verse of “Vegas,” where he stares into the bottom of his emptied cup and empty life with deep shame. “Came out of the gutter, covered in dirt/Got it all over me,” he offers, each brief pause landing like another jab into his own ribs.",Folk,7.7
222,"At its best, Hannah Merrick’s stream-of-consciousness songwriting feels like sitting shotgun with her as she crosses the country, taking in the sublime and the absurd in equal measure. If you think of other artists while listening to Big Swimmer, that’s not lost on King Hannah. Singer Hannah Merrick namedrops Bill Callahan, titles a song after John Prine, and recruits Sharon Van Etten on two songs; the album, Merrick’s second, is clearly the product of those influences. It’s easy to hear echoes of Callahan’s dry humor and Van Etten’s plaintive vocals; Cassandra Jenkins’ meditative jams and Courtney Barnett’s stoned observations come to mind as well. It’s all in service of Merrick’s meandering writing style, which finds meaning in small vignettes borne from traveling America. At its best, Swimmer feels like sitting shotgun with the duo of Merrick and guitarist Craig Whittle, like a tour vlog set to music. Because it’s so laid-back, Swimmer doesn’t necessarily try to transcend its inspirations, but it’s charming in its own right.Merrick spends much of the album going on tangents in a low deadpan voice, as though recording exhausted voice memos documenting a given day’s journey. A lot of those tangents are genuinely funny, like the job interview that opens “New York, Let’s Do Nothing:” “He said, ‘So tell me something about you’/I said, ‘Well I’m a singer, musician too’/He said, ‘Oh no, not another one.’” Elsewhere, the commentary gets lost amid wandering musings on vending machines, as on the eight-minute “Somewhere Near El Paso.” In the album’s most compelling moments, the observations lead somewhere: Merrick increasingly ruminates while watching true-crime documentaries on “Suddenly, Your Hand,” despairing at the callousness of serial killers without being able to pull away. Merrick apologizes for her obsession right at the end (“And I’ve said it before and I will say it again/I’m really sorry for all the moods that I get in”), but Whittle’s closing guitar solo carries on long after, prolonging the fixation.Whenever the album breaks out of its stream-of-consciousness flow, it shows a clearer sense of identity. Merrick’s secret weapon is her soaring singing voice, effectively contrasting the Sprechgesang of much of the record. On the title track, Merrick plays with her vocal phrasing, speeding up and slowing down like a human tape machine, which makes it more striking when she draws out the line, “If it feels right to do so,” on the refrain. On “Lily Pad” and “Davy Says,” Whittle turns his guitars up: The former is an intentional Slint homage (complete with a reference to the Spiderland album cover) and the latter a straight-up catchy pop song. The tighter song structures are a welcome salve against the duo’s tendency to meander. “Lily Pad” changes course halfway through, and that shift hits harder for its abruptness.",Rock,6.9
223,"The singer-songwriter’s new album tackles the tenderness of motherhood with a series of transportive, ambient-adjacent experiments. Natasha Khan has always treated pop music like it’s spell-casting; her pinches of synth-bass and sprinkles of fantastical lyrics create an unmistakable sparkle. Over nearly 20 years performing as Bat for Lashes, the singer-songwriter has become an expert daydreamer—her last album, 2019’s Lost Girls, was written from the perspective of a female biker gang—and her theatricality has drawn frequent comparisons to Kate Bush. Then, in 2020, Khan had a baby. Her body became impossible to ignore, and its tenderness inspired her latest album. Dedicated to and named after Khan’s daughter, The Dream of Delphi offers several intriguing ambient-adjacent experiments—until its enchantment fades like a half-formed thought.To continue the Kate Bush comparisons, The Dream of Delphi is Khan’s own Aerial. Like that 2005 album, in which a typically enigmatic Bush describes her son as sunshine, The Dream of Delphi sees Khan exchange personal sensuality—the wild horses and weepy kissing of past albums—for more earthly musings. The Dream often sounds like a cut-up version of Khan’s discography, taking her beloved strings, sappy ’80s synths, and seashell drums and slicing them into translucent slugs. The instrumental “Breaking Up” twitches slowly, like many of Khan’s bittersweet pop songs, with an imposing synth-bassline that gurgles like an empty stomach. The harpist Mary Lattimore releases starbursts into the title track, matching Bat for Lashes’ tendency to use strings as a sweetener. Khan sings hypnotically of “milk and opal light.” It’s all pretty, but, in comparison to her more hearty compositions, it’s missing protein.Khan is an efficient maximalist when she allows herself to be, drenching everything with cascading synths—every second should be a waterfall or bust. The impulse to make things bigger translates well to the melody-forward ambient music that makes up most of The Dream, so songs like “The Midwives Have Left” have lovely balloon-like buoyancy. Khan’s fudgy voice thins out as she dips into weightless cooing, nested in piano splinters. These moments are some of the album’s most transportive; they recall the best experimental music about motherhood, like Medulla by Björk. A few of the songs on The Dream of Delphi are a little too underdeveloped and end up dissipating into thin air. But it’s Khan’s lyrics, always so full of gravity and grace, that keep the album from stalling out. “Remember you came from a spiral, unfolding,” Khan sings on “Letter to My Daughter” with the measured insight of motherhood. In this music, motherhood sounds as supernatural as it feels to the people who experience it.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

224,"Setting aside the punishing death metal of their main band, the Tomb Mold players’ side project floats a whimsical fusion of math rock and city pop festooned with sneaky metal accents. The shredders of Tomb Mold seem intent on being anything but straight-ahead death-metal musicians. Since establishing their main outfit as one of the beastliest OSDM groups in recent memory, each member has stretched their tentacles further outward. In Dream Unending, guitarist Derrick Vella has embraced heavenly post-rock guitar tones and slowed his riffs to a luminescent crawl, while Tomb Mold’s latest album, The Enduring Spirit, is less a sludgy beatdown than a skyward journey into chorus-pedal-fueled prog. Payson Power and Max Klebanoff, now two EPs into their Daydream Plus side project, have ditched the distortion and devil horns altogether for a breezy fusion of smooth jazz and math rock.If Tomb Mold have been unfairly maligned for dressing like nerds, Daydream Plus practically dare the haters to come after their lunch money. With artwork straight out of an old city-pop record and riffs so smooth you can practically hear the laughter erupting between takes, the whole project feels like an inside joke being wheeled out to the public just to see if it has legs. If the duo’s crisp 2022 EP set the tone, their follow-up, Escape at Your Own Pace, pushes their sound further, adding a new bassist and guitarist to the mix and bringing in the slightest of metal touchstones to create a silly yet satisfyingly light experiment.Once again clocking in under 15 minutes, Escape at Your Own Pace briskly powers through its four short songs, reveling in its low-key vibe. Though the artwork may call back to jazz-fusion albums from the likes of Masayoshi Takanaka and Casiopea, the closer Japanese comparison would be the clean guitar tones of bands like toe and tricot, with Payson fluttering his way through one sweetly melancholic riff after another. “Gently Technical” opens the EP on a surfer’s high, its winsome melody building to a finale laden with show-offy finger taps and cheeky, wind-swept chimes. “Neighborhood Watch” makes the metal connection even more apparent, opening on a blast-beat run from Klebanoff before settling into its sunny groove, with Power firing off the occasional screeching pinch harmonic for good measure. The flourishes are integrated so subtly that if you didn’t know these guys were metalheads in their day jobs, you might miss it entirely.The EP’s remaining half goes down just as easy, even if the tracks are mellow to a fault. “Hourglass” phases through one anime-credits-ready riff after another without offering much in the way of a build, while “Try to Relax” takes its own advice a little too much to heart, cruising on a slow, dreamy riff that effectively puts the EP to bed. The project’s greatest achievement is in the way it continues to widen Tomb Mold’s musical universe. As each member has experimented with brighter tones, it feels like brutality is becoming less central to what this group is trying to achieve. Turns out that once you strip away the monstrous riffs, torrential drums, and imagery of unholy interstellar oblivion, Tomb Mold might actually just be beach-blanket music in disguise.",Rock,6.8
225,"The Louisiana sludge-metal giants have always professed a fondness for classic grunge; they make good on those influences on a streamlined album that’s also one of their heaviest yet. Thou have always reveled in misanthropy. Onstage, the band might antagonize a disengaged audience by taunting them, or turning around and ignoring them. In lyric sheets, they paint humankind as a failed endeavor, once full of potential for good but chronically unable to pry itself from pitfalls as old as civilization itself. This outright disdain is one of the few things that Thou will cop to sharing with the Louisiana sludge-metal forebears, like Eyehategod and Crowbar, to whom they’re frequently compared.Despite obvious similarities in geography, aggression, the lacerating use of guitar feedback, and a stylistic blend of doom metal’s murk and hardcore’s nastiness, Thou have never accepted the sludge mantle. Vocalist Bryan Funck has repeatedly suggested a closer kinship to another decades-old regional scene: Seattle grunge. Thou have amassed a staggering repertoire of grunge covers over the years, and it’s clear that their affinity goes beyond a cheeky fondness for Nirvana. Nevertheless, the band’s own abrasive, atypical, and often meandering compositions can make Funck’s determination to keep sludge at arm’s length seem a little precious. Not even the Melvins at their heaviest have ever sounded a fraction as ugly.But on Umbilical, Thou make their grunge lineage more explicit while maintaining the intensity of their all-encompassing contempt. “Essentially, it’s a diss record,” Funck said of the album in a recent interview. “But I’m dissing Thou.” He turns the magnifying glass on himself, interrogating the anarcho-DIY ethos he’s held since adolescence against the backdrop of the compromises that Thou have made to further their careers. “Everything you’ve ever done, everything you’ve ever said, everything you’ve ever felt is a dagger on my belt,” he shrieks on “Emotional Terrorist,” before flipping his perspective: “Everything I’ve ever done, everything I’ve ever said, everything I’ve ever felt is a chain around my neck.”It might seem like this insistent self-loathing calls for Thou’s most gnarled music yet, but instead we get the band at its most streamlined. This is their first album (excepting collaborations) with no tracks over seven minutes, and none of the brief interludes that the band is fond of. Everything is a song, and most of these songs even abide by something close to standard pop structure. Umbilical is no less heavy than any other Thou album—it might be their heaviest yet—but it no longer requires mental gymnastics to call this music grunge. Maybe it’s Alice in Chains starring in The Crow: murdered by a gang and resurrected in ghastlier form to seek vengeance. Maybe it’s Nirvana after Cobain makes a deal with the Devil, surviving the ’90s but cursed to make progressively more fucked-up albums (Umbilical is perhaps two or three iterations past In Utero).",Metal,7.9
226,"A nice little addition to last year’s breakout Hood Hottest Princess, the St. Louis native’s EP is packed again with filthy, horny, sex-fueled shenanigans. If you were hoping that the filthy, horny, sex-fueled shenanigans of Sexyy Red would forever be stuck in the summer of 2023, I have bad news for you. She’s got another one with In Sexyy We Trust. Sure, last year’s Hood Hottest Princess (damn-near all bangers) can’t be replicated, as part of the appeal was getting caught off guard and going from Oh, that song where she goes “My bootyhole is brown” is funny to Hold up, did she just drop one of the great rap mixtapes of the year? basically overnight. It was such a polarizing sensation that I wouldn’t have been surprised if her follow-up scaled up too much, in a quest to prove that Hood Hottest Princess wasn’t a flash in the pan. But thankfully, Sexyy does not give a fuck. You’re gonna’ get homages to Gucci Mane and Chief Keef, graphic sex jokes and puns, and vulgar-ass quotables required to be shouted anytime you have a drop of alcohol in your system.About half of the tracks on In Sexyy We Trust should be summer anthems. “She’s Back” is a full-throttle DJ set cheat code; if it was up to me I would ban Rihanna’s “Birthday Cake” from being the soundtrack of the cake-cutting and replace it with Sexyy’s “It’s My Birthday.” The St. Louis native has a flair for these fun and rowdy songs that feel nostalgic for Southern and Midwest rap of the past without being pure pastiche. A good example of that is the lead single “Get It Sexyy,” where she howls a few Keef-inspired ad-libs and describes her physical attributes with more detail than an NFL draft scout, all in a hummable singsongy flow. Another is “Sexyy Love Money,” in which her verse starts off hot with an explosive, Waka Flocka-coded opening line (“Got my money up, bitch, I can’t act right”) and doesn’t let up. Her energy is cool yet so contagious that even a buzzkill guest appearance by Chicago drill newcomer VonOff1700 and a couple of punchline clunkers by her (“Higher than a motherfucker, eyes lookin’ like ching-chi”) don’t ruin the exquisite paycheck-hitting-your-bank-account-on-a-holiday-weekend vibe.Fame (going on tour with Drake, photo-ops with Lana Del Rey) hasn’t stopped Sexyy from saying whatever she wants. “Let’s go half on a baby, shoot the club up,” she raps casually on “Boss Me up,” as if she’s talking about splitting the bill at Applebee’s. On the cranked-up “Ova Bad” she blurts out the visual, “Drop and hit some splits, bitch, I wanna see that cameltoe.” Sometimes, though, the shock value can be a little try-hard. For one, the sexual moans on the chorus of “Outside,” the Brazilian funk-infused dud, are just annoying. Then, her duet with Lil Baby “Lick Me” wants to be freaky so bad, but they have such little chemistry that it’s more uncomfortable than sexy.",Rap,7.5
227,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit Cyndi Lauper’s massive debut, a slyly feminist new wave pop record whose undeniable singles helped usher in the MTV era. As Cyndi Lauper leaped around singing “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” The Tonight Show, it seemed like she might never put down the microphone. After she kicked off her stilettos, danced with her backup singers, sprinted back and forth repeatedly from the monitors at the front of the stage to the drum kit in the rear, and belted out the final refrain enough times to ensure that every spectator would be singing it for the rest of the day, the song only ended with the musicians stumbling one by one to a halt: some of them ready to wrap up, and others apparently willing to continue accompanying Lauper until the end of time.“If I wasn’t doing this, Johnny, I might’ve been a brain surgeon or a rocket scientist,” she told Johnny Carson afterwards, refastening her heels and adjusting her jewelry. “A visiting professor at Harvard,” he offered in return. Though the host’s response had a note of condescension for this young woman singer who’d just spent the last several minutes exalting the virtues of a good time above all else, it’s clear that she was in on the joke. There would be no rocket science or brain surgery for Cyndi Lauper: not because she was too fizzy and fun-loving to learn how, but because she was born to perform.There are only three original songs on She’s So Unusual, Lauper’s 1983 debut. Years before its release, she’d been the frontwoman of a cover band. She didn’t need to write songs to express her immense natural talent as a performer. Instead, she used the words of men to illuminate her assertive vision of womanhood, each impassioned yelp a detonation inside its source material. Lauper waffled about ascribing deeper feminist meaning to songs like “Girls Just Want to Have Fun,” but there’s a gravity in her vibrato that’s hard to shake. She brought the weight of her past—her childhood growing up in an abusive home, her battles against male industry gatekeepers—into that music. Her voice walks the line between desperation and the self-assurance she gained from playing in bars night after night. It begs, with its technical skill, to be taken seriously, yet is softened by Lauper’s cartoonish inflections that garnered frequent comparisons to actresses like Bernadette Peters more than contemporary female rockers like Pat Benatar. “That’s all they really want,” she belted on “Girls” with more than a hint of indignation, as if to say, Is that seriously so much to ask?With She’s So Unusual, Lauper shoehorned rebellion into the familiar, both musically and visually: Who else would play a 1920s song written for the real-life Betty Boop wearing tulle fingerless gloves and a mullet? With her taste for synthesizer-driven disco (she apparently met with Giorgio Moroder once, but he seemed to dislike that she called him “George”), Lauper helped to usher in an electronic era for popular rock. After decades of being rejected by her peers, local bands, and record labels, Lauper wanted not just acceptance, but an embrace, of not just her quirks, but of eccentricity itself. She’s So Unusual imagined a world where women danced through New York in ruffle skirts and combat boots, partied with a sense of purpose, and were just as powerful at their most vulnerable as their most ferocious.",Pop,8.0
228,"Unearthing 11 lost recordings from the late ’90s, the Suicide co-founder’s newest posthumous release frames him as a doomsday prophet of the information age. Hell is real, Suicide often seemed to suggest, and it sounds like an anguished Elvis Presley gurgling for dear life, half-submerged in raucous, reverbed waters. For a good amount of his time on Earth, Alan Vega was drowning, too. Long before he was Suicide’s vocalist, he braved a bleak version of New York, sleeping on sidewalks and subsisting on one-dollar tuna sandwiches. He saw the potential of expression to pierce through his oft-barren reality—an itch that led him to the gallery, then the studio, then the No Wave circuit, then the nightmares of innocent concertgoers. (Come for the music, stay for the masochism: If you were lucky, the sharp object he used to slash his chest could have been your shattered wine glass!) As Alan Suicide, a short-lived moniker that preceded his musical career, he exhibited garish pile-ups of light bulbs and wires, like Rudolf Schwarzkogler pieces sans the corpse. The music he made as a solo act felt similar in effect: hazy hellscapes that combined styles like ’50s rockabilly and ’80s synth pop into concoctions that loomed in your head, often for reasons you couldn’t put a finger on.Infinity Punk: A Career-Spanning Interview With Suicide’s Alan VegaIn the years since, it’s become much easier to locate that finger—maybe because his stuff sounds so familiar in retrospect. There are lines to be drawn between Suicide and a number of successors, be it Crystal Castles or Death Grips, but those connections, particularly with Vega’s late-career work, are rooted more in approach than attitude. He was an ideas person, like most denizens of the information era, and decades before SoundCloud, or Kim Gordon avant-rap albums, or distortion-happy hip-hop underclassmen, he gave shape to the impulse to combine those ideas as loudly, and unforgivingly, as possible. That’s what makes Insurrection, his newest posthumous release, such a thrilling listen: Here’s this guy who grew up on Elvis and the Stooges slurring strange, ghastly aphorisms over headbusting drum loops and fighter-jet ASMR. Relentless as it can be, it also sounds like he was having a blast.Since his death in 2016, Vega’s estate has bolstered a scattered catalog with more straightforward collections, their shared tumult less diluted by the happy-go-lucky attitude peppering his earliest efforts. Insurrection unearths 11 punishing, industrial lost recordings from the late ’90s, throwing his radiant vision and wretched reality into direct combat. More often than not, the reality is winning. There’s something both wrenching and invigorating about his gothic, moaned lamentations—“Oh, the angels bleed”; “Where is the light?”; “Oh, the words don’t exist”—on “Mercy,” a trench fight of a track with downbeats that blast like bombs. Vega was never so much a singer as a drawler; on songs like “Sewer” and “Murder One,” he’s rustling unnerving dictums, somewhere between streetside heckler and mythic doomsday prophet.",Electronic,7.8
229,"The singer and composer’s wondrous fourth album deepens the sound of her boundless folk-jazz style. Its gestures are bold, romantic, and often unforgettable. It isn’t easy to say something new with “Autumn Leaves.” The 1945 torch song is surely one of the most performed standards in the jazz repertoire, not only by the likes of Miles Davis and Nat King Cole, but also by the beginners taking lessons in the back rooms of your local store music store: sitting down at a piano to play its wistful minor-key melody is a bit like the jazz version of picking up an electric guitar and going straight for “Smoke on the Water.” Putting your rendition on a new album in 2024 is either a conservative move or a bold one. For Arooj Aftab, the Brooklyn-via-Lahore singer and composer who moves freely between jazz, folk, and Hindustani and Western classical music, it is decidedly the latter.Aftab’s “Autumn Leaves” comes early on Night Reign, her fourth solo album, and renders it as a ghostly incantation. Metallic percussion clatters in the background. Linda May Han Oh’s upright bass lines follow Aftab’s vocal like an elongated shadow follows the protagonist of a noir film. Without a chordal instrument to support it, the familiar tune becomes skeletal and spooky; Aftab’s chromatic embellishments make it spookier. Her take on “Autumn Leaves” is emblematic of the way she works: drawing from tradition while at the same time estranging it, stripping away clichés and stock devices to reveal the mysterious longing that gives the old poems and songs their lasting power.Two of Night Reign’s songs take their words from Mah Laqa Bai Chanda, the 18th-century poet who was the first woman to publish a collection of work in Urdu. Other lyrics are Aftab originals, in both English and Urdu. Still another is based on an offhanded poem that the singer’s friend, the Pakistani actress Yasra Rizvi, posted to Instagram. Aftab unites her source material’s mix of the centuries-old and the ephemeral with her wondrous voice, sometimes soaring but just as potent in its husky lower register. And with her compositions, which patiently gather and dissolve, favoring long arcs of development over sudden dynamic shifts. Though Night Reign has plenty of distinct zones—grungy bass guitar takes the lead on “Bolo Na”; Auto-Tune drapes Aftab’s voice on “Raat Ki Rani”—as a whole it can have the feeling of a single sweeping piece of music.Aftab, who produces her albums herself, deserves as much credit for her composing and arranging as she does for her singing. Night Reign’s palette is similar to Vulture Prince, her 2021 breakout album, and features many of the same players along with a few new ones: harpist Maeve Gilchrist, whose instrument is second only to Aftab’s singing as the signature sound of her music; Aftab’s Love in Exile bandmates, jazz piano star Vijay Iyer and multi-instrumentalist Shahzad Ismaily; guitarists Kaki King and Gyan Riley; flautist Cautious Clay; percussionist Jamey Haddad; an unlikely Wurlitzer cameo from Elvis Costello. Their instruments drift like a breeze of dandelion seeds, in the same general direction but with independent and unpredictable paths between one point and another. Even Moor Mother, whose stentorian spoken-word is one of the most distinctive sounds in left-of-center music, becomes just another element of the melange when she arrives to deliver a guest verse on “Bolo Na,” the percussive edges of her delivery swept up in the song’s half-time rhythmic churn.",Jazz,8.3
230,"The Long Beach rapper threads the fables of the past with the reality of the present for another expertly written, starkly candid record. Vince Staples is not the rapper you come to for lyrical acrobatics. His bars are stark, jumping between straightforward recountings of gang-related violence and bits of dry humor fit for a Mitch Hedberg set. Both also extend into his presence as one of the rap internet’s favorite talking heads; he can turn an explanation of why he doesn’t share his home address with his closest friends into a hilarious exchange—until you stop to think about what exactly makes him so guarded. This candor helps his stories, jokes, and his recent Coen Brothers-indebted Netflix series, The Vince Staples Show, stick to the ribs.Looking back, Dark Times feels like a logical progression from his last few projects. During the press run for 2022’s Ramona Park Broke My Heart, Staples admitted he was ready to move on from making “an anthology of my neighborhood and my past,” a promise he frequently bends to suit his needs. Dark Times has plenty of trauma, but the difference is it more directly intersects with his present life as a celebrity trying to stay out of the way. “Children’s Song” hangs a lantern on this idea early by starting as a rallying cry for a friend who’s locked up before offering a cold reality check: “Niggas be like ‘Aye bro, ‘member back when?/Let it go, loc/I’m way too rich to be your friend/I’m way too lit to let you dim me,” he says in his trademark deadpan. That couplet is even more cutting when this hook follows just two bars later: “Don’t play with my Crippin’, go play with your kids, bitch.” He’s having his cake and eating it in the most Vince Staples way imaginable.Staples’ monotone voice used to dilute his more intense songs, but now he just sounds tired of having to read everything and everyone for an angle. After mapping out hip-hop toxicity over EDM and techno beats (made specifically for sync licensing) on Big Fish Theory and memorializing the California of his youth on his 2021 self-titled album and Ramona Park, who wouldn’t be? His insouciance still leads to great stories and affirmations of Black resilience, but what once registered as body blows now lands like a firm but loving grasp on the shoulder from an older relative.“Justin” slowly builds romantic tension up to its bombshell ending—the woman Staples is courting suddenly introduces him to her actual boyfriend as her little cousin—and then discards it with a shrug, like Staples is mad at himself for getting caught up. Other highlights like “Étouffée” and “‘Radio’” recast old encounters and family history as edifying parables for a stolen youth. On the former, Staples’ connections to Louisiana inspire him to chart a path from toting guns in Polo pajamas to a place where it’s a privilege to be told your music fell off. Later, “‘Radio’” draws bridges between chance encounters with music, from having his life changed after hearing Blu & Exile’s Below the Heavens to appreciating Brandy and Roberta Flack more after a bad breakup. Using his still-blistering concision, these lessons flesh out aspects of Staples’ notoriously private life and give credence to motivational pieces like “Little Homies” and the opening verse for “Freeman.” It’s easier to take Staples’ advice (“You don’t gotta crash out for the set, lil homie/Keep your head on the swivel when you step”) and longing (“I’ll never find a equal mind, I’ll settle for the fattest ass”) seriously when he’s laid out the steps he took to get there.",Rap,7.6
231,"Reconnecting with his heartland rock roots, John Rossiter interrogates his artistic impulses and creates his most magnetic and direct record to date. Here’s an incomplete cast of characters that populate The Fool, Young Jesus’ provocative seventh album: a pair of washed-up outlaws, an elderly man entirely reliant on his children, a doctor who gets caught creeping on his patient’s social media, and, on “MOTY,” a menagerie of garden variety misogynists, hypocrites, and insecure momma’s boys fronting as alpha males. Oh, and the person who gets lost in their memories of being abused as a child and comes to, decades later, standing over a dog they’ve just beaten.Yet, the most unnerving characters are the ones John Rossiter allows us to believe are himself—artists who’ve witnessed the life-saving powers of art firsthand and seen it curdle into condescension, delusions of grandeur, and revulsion towards the people most like him. While Rossiter hasn’t confirmed whether any of The Fool is autobiographical, it’s an unsparing, indelible product of a man who had to question every one of his artistic motivations before making the most vital album of his life.Rossiter’s interrogative approach—to pop music, to literature, gender norms, to the social contract, to truth itself—serves as the connective tissue throughout Young Jesus’ fascinating discography, which has earned legitimate comparisons to the Hold Steady, Talk Talk, and Albert Ayler. But there’s also the one remnant of Rossiter’s formative era as a hard-drinking Midwestern garage rocker: the impulse to blow everything up on the verge of a conventional success. After 2015’s Grow/Decompose brought Young Jesus’ initial phase as Chicagoland barstool bards to a wider audience, Rossiter moved to Los Angeles and did what transplants do: experimented with spirituality, got into free jazz, and started book clubs. A trilogy of exploratory albums followed, each one tantalizingly close to a masterpiece. But due to burnout—or just the sense that Young Jesus’ incarnation as a post-rock jam band had become its own kind of formula—Rossiter disbanded the group and released the stripped-down Shepherd Head; like all Young Jesus albums, it felt transitional, but this was the first time that Rossiter lacked conviction in his direction.The Fool does not have that problem. The opening duo of “Brenda & Diane” and “Two Brothers” brings Young Jesus back to their roots—gleaming acoustic strums and brassy synth washes, a gruff guy singing imperiously of the downtrodden trying to protect their dignity, the sort of things that gets called “heartland rock” in 2024; surely someone as studious as Rossiter recognizes the evocative nature of their respective titles. Whereas most of Young Jesus’ work on Saddle Creek trafficked in dialectics, arcane philosophical tracts, and 15-minute jam sessions, The Fool gets right to the point, with Rossiter putting his trust in direct statements—“True love is a little bit like hell,” the goddamn American Dream, concepts dismissed as cliche until time and experience reveals their enduring truth. Towards the end of “Two Brothers,” Rossiter meets a humble gardener who works the Earth to get closer to God, which would’ve been too pat of a literary device had Rossiter not temporarily quit music to study permaculture.",Rock,7.8
232,"After 2022’s stripped-back Sewaside II, the Montreal rapper-producer opts for stranger beats, a packed guest list, and what sound like real instruments to balance his beguiling sample flips. Mike Shabb has been a secret weapon in Montreal’s rap scene for years. Rather than turning out other staple sounds of the city—the danceable electro funk of Kaytranada or Planet Giza, the industrial and metal-tinged catharsis of Zambian transplant Backxwash—Shabb leans toward the new-age formalism of producer Nicholas Craven and rappers like Chung. He started out making trap around 2017, but he was also a fan of the classic boom-bap and airy, drumless loops that still define certain corners of underground hip-hop. After connecting with Griselda affiliate Craven, Shabb worked to refine his diverse sounds, dropping vibey turn-up joints like 2021’s Quarantine Flow and 2023’s Hood Olympics while doing ad hoc engineering for Boldy James and earning multiple beat placements on Westside Gunn’s 10.Shabb has an ear for beguiling samples and knows how to work them into beats spacious enough for scenery-chewers like Estee Nack to stomp through. After the handsome and stripped-back production of Sewaside II, which emphasized boasts, koans, and confessions told through his slick Montreal slur, he reaches higher and digs deeper on this year’s Sewaside III. The beats are stranger, the guest list is more packed, and there even seem to be live instruments in the mix. Shabb goes grander without trying to fix what isn’t broken, letting gnarled tendrils grow out of an already solid foundation.As a rapper, Shabb takes the lifestyle route, detailing his day-to-day in the 514. He isn’t concisely poetic like Boldy or a cartoonish bruiser like Gunn or Nack; depending on whether he’s slinging metaphors or simply storytelling, his croak of a voice oscillates between chill and despondent. Most of the time, he’s posted on the block and plotting out next moves while fear and regret linger in the margins. On “Grinchy,” where he’s masked up like MF DOOM and carrying a dog on him like Jim Carrey in How the Grinch Stole Christmas, a stray line sticks out from the warbling piano and betrays Shabb’s true feelings: “I keep my head high in situations I can’t cope.” That sentiment ripples under every moment on the album—from spliff tugs in the middle of shootouts where marks are running like Forrest Gump (“Free Cars”) to memorializing fallen friends and looking after their sons like Shep in Above the Rim (“Julie”). Fleeting moments of sadness prove that he’s only lowered the mask so much, and that intrigue keeps every vignette compelling.",Rap,7.4
233,"In a new archival collection, Jim O’Rourke and David Grubbs have polished and stitched together every scrap and forgotten rarity into one final album, a fitting final chapter for an indescribably great band. In a 1998 interview, David Grubbs once perfectly described the mysterious, impossible-sounding music he and Jim O’Rourke briefly conjured as Gastr Del Sol. “Every record saw us determined to create a different group with each song,” he said, capturing an amorphous quality running through their trio of perception-shattering albums, as well as the project’s initial debut as an entirely different group.Grubbs started Gastr Del Sol in 1991 with Bundy K. Brown and John McEntire as an acoustic shift from their hardcore trio Bastro. Meanwhile, O’Rourke, emerging from the avant-garde music world, joined after one album just as Brown and McEntire were focusing on their own project Tortoise. Each album the duo made together—1994’s Crookt, Crackt or Fly, 1996’s Upgrade & Afterlife, and 1998’s swan song Camoufleur—feels like a classic of its era, but what many miss is how exciting, disorienting, and bizarre Gastr Del Sol could get on just a single, compilation track or the rare live performance. In the remarkable archival collection, We Have Dozens of Titles, Grubbs and O’Rourke shine a light on those obscure songs and oddities forming the shadow of an album that feels as rewarding as their main ones. Paired with recently discovered recordings of their final performance, it captures how this duo could feel so alive and unpredictable, across the span of a song or an entire discography, from a first rehearsal to a final show.Listening to Gastr Del Sol’s music is like trying to grasp smoke. A soft piano chord, the hum of a harmonium, or a fingerpicked knot of John Fahey-inspired guitar might cast a sprawling shadow of musique concrète, erupt in guitar feedback by noise artist Kevin Drumm, or swoon into an orchestral sample from a ’50s monster movie like The Incredible Shrinking Man. In one breathtaking moment on “The Sea Uncertain,” from Upgrade & Afterlife, a whistling tea kettle and a screaming internet modem form a quiet duet.Dozens begins with a work-in-progress, a live version of “The Seasons Reverse” found on unearthed recordings of the band’s final performance at the 1997 Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville in Québec. While the version that would appear a year later on Camoufleur adds McEntire’s hypnotic polyrhythms, glitchy electronics from Oval’s Markus Popp, flourishes of steel drum, elastic cornet, and Grubbs’ jubilantly surreal wordplay, the song’s most miraculous twist is already fully formed live. Its dense guitar work spirals endlessly deeper until the pop of Grubbs’ strings is as big as exploding fireworks. And then, as O’Rourke sneaks a field recording into the mix, you realize there are fireworks. It’s a humbling, beautiful climax that’s suddenly interrupted by an inquisitive French voice, then O’Rourke’s stammering “Don’t worry, keep doing it! It’s a microphone…I’m recording you blowing off firecrackers…” The moment simply blows up in O’Rourke’s face as he desperately tries to explain and salvage things with the perturbed stranger he’s been recording, only offering further apologies that he can’t speak French. As a field recording it’s a stroke of genius—while simultaneously roasting themselves and field recordings.",Rock,8.4
234,"Using inscrutable digital techniques—randomization, automation, perhaps a little black magic—the Bay Area artist makes bewitchingly skewed techno full of tangled loops and mismatched time signatures. In the 14 years between his first and second solo albums, James Devane completely retooled both his sound and the methods he used to achive it. Where 2008’s s/t built up swirling drones from looped guitar, his 2022 follow-up, Beauty Is Useless paired dense, soupy synth strokes with techno’s taut rhythms. With the much swifter sequel Searching, it’s starting to look like Devane makes a habit of reinventing his approach on every release. Exactly how he made the music is unclear; the label vaguely notes hours of source material (presumably the artist’s own) run through custom software, and fashioned into tracks that play fast and loose with musical key, tempo, and rhythm. All that complexity appears to lie beneath an unusually simple interface: in Devane’s words, “a search button and a save button.”When an artist hands the reins to software—hardly an unusual practice in 2024—it’s not always clear where the technology ends and human creativity begins. Yet similarities between Beauty Is Useless and Searching—which Devane frames as a companion piece to its predecessor—help locate the person within the process. On both records, a smoky, clandestine quality clings to the synths and murky rhythmic elements, recalling gloaming air that permeates the work of Kassem Mosse and other artists on Germany’s Workshop label.If Beauty Is Useless was largely guided by an even-tempered 4/4 pulse, Searching jettisons that framework in favor of a much more disruptive listening experience. The more fully formed tracks have a meandering, structureless quality interrupted by abrupt endings and brief sketches —alarming 10-second blasts of noise that sound like the digital equivalent of scrubbing through recorded tape as quickly as possible. It’s a playful analogy that foregrounds Devane’s conceptual process, with its apparent emphasis on cycling through found sounds.Even in the cyclical ambiguity of techno, a lack of formal structure can be risky, and Devane leans into the chaos. On Searching, crispy percussive sequences play against each other in mismatched time signatures, yielding a kind of mutant funk. Yet the forced looping of these contrary musical elements—especially noticeable on ""One Place”—harness even the most disjointed rhythms into surprisingly fluid grooves. Aided by the woozy comfort of the machine-soul synth blooms, stubborn loops are seductive, in their own weird way, even without the comfort of a conventional toe-tapping pulse or journeying narrative.The jarring effect of the rhythmic disturbances has its own charm, but the more stable moments on the record are easier to sink into. The mesmerizing melancholy of “No More No Less” recalls the yearning, misty-eyed quality of Actress’ breakthrough albums; similarities with Darren Cunningham’s off-center vision of techno abound in Devane’s crooked thump and low-res aliasing.",Electronic,7.7
235,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit a lost downtempo classic from 1993, a dreamy, fascinating chimera of styles and moods produced by the legendary Andrew Weatherall. The press, in the early ’90s, used a lot of conflicting, if creative, words to describe the music of One Dove. The Scottish band’s 1993 debut album, produced by the DJ and musician Andrew Weatherall, delighted many, disappointed some, and confounded others. Project X magazine, an American publication catering to ravers (which included infamous party monster Michael Alig on staff), put the band’s singer Dot Allison on the cover in a scuba diving suit and declared them to make “some of the most emotion-filled electronic music since the techno-revolution began.” The New York Times called their album “a juxtaposition of eerie, languorous electronics, bleary borderline dance music and quietly torchy pop songs.” The NME, though loquacious, was not convinced. They appreciated that while the band had a “vision of blasting mainstream pop sky high with clubland’s mighty beats and sun-drenched vibes,” ultimately Morning Dove White was “likely to lull you into a light coma.”Were One Dove here to humanize the mechanical sound of acid house then taking over clubs? Or were their dreamy guitar solos meant to help future-proof the suddenly staid sound of British rock? Was singer Dot Allison a star or a snooze? Was everybody even listening to the same band? To that last point, based on the extensive amount of remixes they released, as well as early album leaks with alternate mixes, it’s possible that, no, they were not.Regardless, in the 31 years since their sole LP Morning Dove White was released, not too many people have listened to any version of the album. It has been out of print for nearly 25 years, and, until recently, not on streaming services. To add insult to injury, the version available on streaming services now mistakenly repeats track six, “My Friend,” as track seven, “Transient Truth.” “Listen now,” sings Allison on that song, which, if you don’t have a physical copy, you’ll have to head to YouTube to hear, “If you take my words as promises, well then you can keep them.” At least they never felt like they owed anyone anything.Undoubtedly some of the hype surrounding the album isn’t even of their own making: The band had persuaded Weatherall—renowned for his sledgehammering of genre barriers—to produce their debut. This was immediately after he’d worked with Primal Scream on their groundbreaking album, Screamadelica, which was released to great fanfare during the recording of Morning Dove White. That album’s massive swell, its groundbreaking blend of ecstatic rock guitar work and buoyant house music drum work, became Weatherall’s signature sound. He’d bring some of that in a more subdued form to Morning Dove White. That’s undeniable. Whether he also brought unmeetable expectations is up for debate.",Electronic,8.7
236,"The AACM composer pays tribute to the cultural history of a monumental work of public infrastructure in a set of elegiac pieces for trumpet and piano. Central Park sits like a monster’s footprint in the middle of Manhattan, girdled with towers, lush and verdant but hard to mistake for the wilderness. Such an imposing work of infrastructure appeals to Wadada Leo Smith. The great AACM trumpeter and composer’s releases since 2012’s Ten Freedom Summers encompass an alternative map of America, lovingly sketching in its Great Lakes and National Parks while honoring its civil rights leaders, artistic geniuses, and the millions displaced and killed in its creation. Smith composed six of the seven pieces on Central Park’s Mosaics of Reservoir, Lake, Paths and Gardens, and he’s joined by pianist and AACM cohort Amina Claudine Myers, who completed the sessions with no prior rehearsal. Smith describes Central Park as his favorite park in the world, but from the first minor-key piano notes on “Conservatory Gardens,” it’s clear that Mosaics is about more than bucolic landscapes.The tone is stately and almost elegiac throughout, as if a grand, seismic, and vaguely frightening event is taking place on a glacial timescale. Myers broods in the lower octaves, providing the bedrock through which Smith’s horn cuts like a river through the landscape—or like a path through a garden, or like the park itself through Manhattan’s skyscraper canyons. It’s a delight when her hands dance freely into the higher registers, as in the last minute of her splendid solo piano piece “When Was,” but she and Smith largely proceed at a deliberate pace. It could work as ambient music if Smith’s sharp tone did not so thoroughly dominate the mix; its first appearance on “Conservatory Gardens” after more than a minute of insinuating piano intervals from Myers comes as an abrupt shock on an initial listen.Mosaics is as interested in the park’s human history as its natural beauty. One of the longest and most beautiful pieces on the relatively short record is “Albert Ayler, a meditation in light,” in which the spirit of the late free-jazz icon apparently inspired the loosest and most convivial interplay between the two. “Imagine, a mosaic for John Lennon” is (thankfully) not a rendition of “Imagine” but an extension of the album’s air of twinkling mystery. The spot near Central Park where Lennon died is a popular site of pilgrimage for Beatles fans; the album’s somber tone suggests an awareness of the millions of lives and deaths that make up New York’s past, the sheer density of human history one can feel in every square inch of the city.In its exploration of a relatively small part of NYC as a microcosm of its complexities, Smith and Myers’ album is spiritual kin to Loren Connors’ stunning solo guitar albums Hell’s Kitchen Park and 9th Avenue, which channeled the vanishing Irish-American history of the gentrifying Manhattan neighborhood of Hell’s Kitchen. Like those albums, Mosaics is short, just 36 minutes, more than a quarter of them occupied by “Conservatory Gardens.” But it doesn’t feel small, even when compared to Smith’s almost improbably ambitious epics like the four-and-a-half-hour Pulitzer nominee Ten Freedom Summers. Its borders seem to extend beyond its confines, as if there’s a theoretical piece for every meadow and lake in Central Park and this is just a small leakage from a vast parallel universe rendered through music.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

237,"The Brooklyn indie rock band’s fourth album is an anxious and sour record that copes with capitalism and its knock-on emotional effects. It’s been five years since DIIV’s last album—clearly, there has been some lingering tension. To set the table: After lead singer Zachary Cole Smith was arrested in 2013 for heroin possession preempting his first trip to rehab and DIIV’s former bassist Devin Ruben Perez was kicked out of the band for making racist comments on 4chan, DIIV “essentially broke up” in 2016. Then, after another stint in rehab, Smith and the band pulled it together for their last album, 2019’s Deceiver, but by this point, frustration was embedded in their dynamic.Press materials are pointedly vague about how the band worked through “suspicions and resentments” before completing Frog in Boiling Water, their sour new album coping with capitalism. Its chiffon layers of reverb wrap around the guitars like a burial cloth, and Smith accepts the boat ride down to purgatory in distant vocals. “Will you please leave me alone,” he implores on “Reflected,” floating through lost souls with self-possession. He’s gotten used to the dark.Other DIIV albums are more concerned with inward darkness, the addiction and depression that dot the band’s history. But Frog acknowledges that these illnesses feed off of and into an already miserable society. “Systems fail and empires fall,” Smith shrugs under raindrops of guitar on “Fender on the Freeway,” sounding jaded and overstimulated. While Frog's vocal melodies are often simple, with nursery-rhyme lightness, tuning into their lyrics make them seem more like sugar-coated pills. They establish Smith as both an objector of the failing system and another one of its many idle subjects, free-floating in the rush of disappointment. The weightless “Frog In Boiling Water” blames technology for this half-hearted complacency, smothering disappointment in reverb the way some people replace unpleasant sensations with posting online.Leading up to Frog’s release, DIIV published an unhinged, endless scroll, Web 1.0 site called soul-net.co. Its content informs visitors that “we are all greasing [the capitalist machine] with our blood and sweat.” Under this text, a naked fairy GIF waggles blue wings, a list combines “the smokestacks, the camps, the landfills, the DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES,” and there’s a PNG of John Hancock’s signature. It goes on and on like this, like the ramblings of a computer-savvy serial killer in the ’90s. The site also has a song on autoplay, “Soul-net,” which appears on Frog as the mirage of a star, a glimmer of irony: “I’m not afraid,” Smith affirms, “I love my pain.”You could glean some of the band’s anxious hysteria out of this. They revel in images and ideas usually associated with suspicious Facebook grandmas worried about “seed oils.” Like an anonymous account might say alongside an image of lizard Joe Biden, Smith is disturbed by how “the rotating villains profit off suffering.” He sneers at a good citizen’s purpose, to be “fodder for the army op.” But he also sings with soft insistence, and his restraint is convincing. Everyone has a good reason to feel as fractured as Frog sounds. Its guitar-led production makes sense of the stress by dumping it into pressure-cooker whining.Though, more often, the guitars would rather loaf in the mud. The band takes pleasure in simple melodies with muscle, like on the melancholy “In Amber.” There, the rhythm guitar bounces like a nervous leg until the lead guitar wrests the song open. DIIV repeatedly employ this tactic throughout the album, presenting each song like a cold tomb to be set on fire, typically, by a one-note guitar solo you can feel drilling into your stomach. It’s thrilling. “Little Birds” is like a dry lightning field, empty aside from the occasional crackle of distortion. But its lead guitar always returns to the same note, filling the space with an insistent echo. These repetitive moments come on like a ticking clock, and Frog in Boiling Water operates with a prophetic understanding that time has already run out.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

238,"The Brooklyn producer’s debut album is filled with immersive, inventive reimaginings of dance music, flickering between ecstasy and decay. The music that opens M Wagner’s We Could Stay doesn’t fade-up as much as it lumbers into view. It carries a crackling sense of inevitability, as if you’re watching a shelf cloud advance on a city skyline. Suddenly, it’s upon you: An enormous four-chord vamp mangled by distortion and haunted vocal echoes, the song’s shimmering chimes playing around the edges. There’s a seductive elegance to the track’s destruction, like spending your final moments caught in a tornado, marveling at its power. In its last quarter, the noisy layers of “Release Yrself” fall away, leaving the softly glowing embers of a lullaby-like melody. Right when it feels light enough to drift off on the breeze, Wagner brings in a startling, stabbing trance synth, caking it with the blistering overdrive of a tape deck eating itself.We Could Stay, the Brooklyn electronic musician’s staggering debut, artfully oscillates between moments of hypnotic bliss and jarring violence. Wagner keeps his programmed percussion as uncomplicated as possible, stripping house, garage, and techno down to the studs. His work isn’t at all minimal, though; the utilitarian grooves leave plenty of space, which Wagner fills with interlocking loops, infinitely repeating micro samples, and droning synths that shudder and spiral when agitated. There are shades of GAS and the Field here—Wagner’s an avid fan of ambient techno pioneers like Wolfgang Voigt and Biosphere—but rather than stretching towards an ever-distant horizon, his work operates in a much tighter radius. Some of the dreamier textures he employs could be traced back to Silver Liz, the psych-pop band he founded with his wife Carrie in 2016—he even samples Carrie’s vocals from Silver Liz’s “Terrapin” on We Could Stay’s title track. And despite economical run times, each track is a full journey, Wagner gleefully bending dance music tropes into unpredictable shapes. Inspect his wall of sound a little closer, and you’ll discover the thunderous roar cleverly hiding a pop sensibility.One of the key aspects of Wagner’s compositional style is the gradual, almost imperceptible introduction of new elements. He often brings in a sample or instrument through a slow fade, so that by the time it’s prominent in the mix, you’ve forgotten what the song sounded like without it. “Marcy Av” starts with a solitary bass drum, and slowly evolves into a simple, swinging UK garage pattern—more DJ transition tool than album cut. As it shuffles along, a sine wave sequence flickers to life, metallic glitches form a melody, and a splashy breakbeat emerges—all funneling into the final detuned, richly harmonic chord.The ghostly vocal samples on “Never Gone” bubble up so gently, it’s hard to tell if they’re actually there or if your brain’s working to make sense of the song’s cacophonous, shoegazing frequencies. Halfway through “Rome Generator,” you’ll suddenly become aware of the syncopated kicks, but rewind a little, and you’ll discover they’d initially appeared a full minute before, buried beneath a strobing keyboard. Throughout We Could Stay, Wagner pairs these subtle transitions with more traditional, gridlike techno structures, maintaining an alluring dichotomy between the celestial and the grounded. The record loses itself a little near the end, coming down from the neon-streaked jungle climax of “Thanks for Listening” with two ambient pieces that, while gorgeous, tread somewhat similar ground. But for the better part of its 41-minute runtime, We Could Stay is breathlessly thrilling—bruised, beautiful, and completely engulfing.",Experimental,7.6
239,"The New Jersey rapper returns with a supreme sense of confidence. He glides effortlessly over grainy beats, putting his skill for meandering but meticulous raps on full display. Mach-Hommy has accomplished a rare form of anonymity in the digital age. He’s rarely seen without a mask or Haitian flag bandana adorning his face, plus it’s borderline impossible to find his government name online. But even in candid moments, he keeps his cards close. Mach’s virtual listening event for #RICHAXXHAITIAN, which was designed to welcome listeners into his world, felt shrouded in intentional secrecy: A pair of streams that ran the album once, with no fast-forwarding or rewinding available, no lyrics provided, and buffering and skipping to be expected. The brand of confidentiality he’s built as part of his public persona—marked by a refusal to explain himself, instead letting his knowledge and skill say it all—is akin to a tenured professor who is allergic to slowing down as they blister through lectures. Only if you engage with the material with attention and care will the image of Mach become a little clearer.#RICHAXXHAITIAN is Mach’s first solo venture in nearly three years, since the critically acclaimed Pray for Haiti and Balens Cho (Hot Candles) dropped in 2021. The list of collaborators is packed with familiar faces: Fellow underground darlings, like Sadhugold, Conductor Williams, and Quelle Chris, help out on production duties, while Tha God Fahim, Your Old Droog, and other guests contribute verses. But the close-knit circle doesn’t mean Mach needs to rely on old tricks; instead, he’s thrillingly meticulous, putting his talent for daisy-chaining raps and concepts on full display. #RICHAXXHAITIAN is his most expansive project since 2016’s HBO (Haitian Body Odor); it’s an opus executed with a level of precision that’s come to be expected of the prolific rapper.Mach has cemented himself as a shapeshifter, contorting his voice to rap, sing, and glide over the grainy surface of his beats. And while #RICHAXXHAITIAN is a quintessential Mach-Hommy project—the mixing makes his words garble through the muddiness as if they’re hazy memories, similar to previous records—the production landscape is vast enough to evoke all of his vocal personalities. The percussive crashes and soothing scales from the hands of pianist Georgia Anne Muldrow create the perfect foil for Mach’s morose bars on “Sonje.” His crooning against the accordion on “The Serpent and the Rainbow,” the storybook piano loops of the Quelle Chris-composed “Copy Cold,” and the trudging drums of “Antonomasia” are perfect for headphones on a sub-zero day in Newark in 1997. All register as adventures born out of ease and supreme confidence.",Rap,8.0
240,"The North Carolina rapper’s fourth album clarifies her identity and the depth of her talent over lush blends of R&B, gospel, reggae, and trap. It’s a vivid affirmation of self and community—and a rap clinic. For years, Rapsody has done the exhausting work of reminding people that Black women aren’t a monolith. On 2019’s Eve, she named each song after a Black woman, using each muse to build out bespoke worlds of sounds and images. The concept subtly applied to Rapsody as well: from a prominent Uncle Luke sample, to a fun refrain about big ole butts, the North Carolina rapper chipped away at the idea that her love of lyricism is antithetical to sexuality and fun. She’d clearly heard the puritan calls to “Listen to Rapsody,” a thing goobers like to say to diminish other female rappers, and felt misrepresented.Please Don’t Cry sets the record straight. Taking a hammer to the idea that she is merely a lyricist or conscious rapper—her own monolith—Rapsody clarifies her identity and the depth of her talent over lush blends of R&B, gospel, reggae, and trap. The record is a vivid affirmation of self and community, and a rap clinic. She sounds unleashed.Rapsody frames the shapeshifting album as a verklempt therapy session with storied actress Phylicia Rashad, who encourages her to let the feelings flow. She obliges, cycling through styles as she reflects on her career and struggles. Please Don’t Cry is clearly a reset. It’s her first album without production from longtime mentor and label head 9th Wonder, and though the record has traces of Jamla Records’ soulful boom-bap, there’s more sheen than dust. Besides Eric G, Rapsody sources the production entirely from outside her label, tapping A-list vets like S1 and Hit-Boy and fresh faces like BLK ODYSSY. She also recruits more singers than fellow rappers, departing from the posse cuts of her past work. The result is an album festooned in tones and melodies, its mix of modern and classic sounds evoking humid Dungeon Family funk, uplifting Miseducation spirituality, and moody TDE medleys. The beats alone relay Rapsody’s raging multiplicity.At 41, Rapsody’s got nothing to prove, but plenty on her mind, and lots of ways to share it. From the opening lines of “Marlanna,” her real name, she’s in constant flux, reintroducing herself as a vocalist and composer as much as a lyricist. “The one they call boring, still boarding/I’m unseen, I’m morphine, I tried to ease your pain/Now I’m morphing, some never change, I had to,” she raps, her pitch rising with each line. “DND (It’s Not Personal)” flips Monica’s “Don’t Take It Personal” into a balmy G-funk ode to solitude. Rapsody’s voice swings between peeved and pianissimo as she details her perfect day alone, building to a clever “Juicy” interpolation that somehow also has shades of 2Pac: “Me days are the best days/Days like these days, I’m on the beach sippin’ lychee,” Rapsody sings. Impressively, the music never strains under all these currents. It is sumptuous and referential without feeling cluttered.",Rap,8.1
241,"The latest viral rapper absorbs Black influences while marketing himself as if he doesn’t. His songs are fine, but he is a cipher, a husk, and a vacuum of taste. Yeah, there’s another viral rap sensation. I know, this happens basically every other week, but this is our reality. Some are cool as hell; some I hope to never hear again. There will be many, many more. This one is named ian. Yes, just ian. After a few years of uploading music to SoundCloud, he blew the fuck up in early 2024 through a combination of outrage clicks and undiscerning excitement. The reason was simple: He was a white guy dressed like a frat boy on his way to his 8 a.m. finance class who made technically OK music that sounded like he was in Slayworld, the internet-famous group that once included Summrs, Autumn!, Izaya Tiji, and Yeat. Yeat is white, too, but unlike Yeat, who tried to distract from his whiteness with the questionable use of turbans and alien-speak, ian leaned into his suburban white kid schtick: vanilla outfits (white tee, sweats, slides) and a From the Block video for his breakout song “Figure It Out” shot at an outdoor lunch with his sitcom-looking real-life family, where you can spot full wine glasses, a prep school hoodie, and an American flag swaying in the wind.“Figure It Out” is the lead single to ian’s first full mixtape, Valedictorian, which includes artwork that mimics the “You know I had to do it to ’em” meme and premiered at a packed listening party on the streets of New York, blasted out of the sunroof of a minivan. It’s probably his best song, though that isn’t saying much. Through his slurred, ATL-style melodies, he delivers a sprint of catchy flexes like, “Can’t choose what color I’m feelin’ today, thank God it’s a two-toned watch” and “My big brother like Marshawn Lynch, he’ll run through somebody.” The official Lyrical Lemonade video (anywhere there’s a popular rapping white boy, you’ll find Cole Bennett) even includes a cameo from Marshawn Lynch, which is pretty cringe because you just know the joke is supposed to be Tough, Black ex-NFL star hangs out with suburban white rapper.That right there explains the problem with Valedictorian: It’s making a joke out of the music and culture it’s trying to swagger-jack. Everything is so tongue in cheek: Look, isn’t it so funny that a college-age white kid who you could imagine playing lacrosse at a New England private school has a mixtape hosted by DJ Holiday, famous for talking his shit on some of the greatest Gucci Mane and Chief Keef projects? “This the coldest motherfucker I seen in a long ass time, dressed white as hell though,” says Holiday, laughing (probably in disbelief about how much he’s being paid). “Fuckin’ rich ass prick.” Look, isn’t it so funny that he’s got beats that sound like old Zaytoven (all except one by producer Sxprano)? “Judgment,” with its calming strings and crafty drums, sounds like a replica of something Zay would have given to Yung L.A. Look, isn’t it so funny when he raps a bunch of car puns like Young Dro (“They go both ways in the Cullinan truck, the doors must hate each other,” from “Grand Slam”), or imitates the Auto-Tune melodies of Dirty Sprite-era Future (“Bentayga”), or wants so badly to be Chief Keef (“AirBnb”)? The irony is there to distract you from the fact that this is empty music. If you heard it without a face attached, you would click on it, observe that it’s a sauceless copy of its influences, and keep scrolling.",Rap,4.1
242,"Released just 10 days after Steve Albini’s death, the trio’s sixth record closes the book on the band and serves as a reliably excellent epitaph. To All Trains is a Shellac record. Expectedly, thankfully, obviously, unapologetically, unremarkably a Shellac record. A 180-gram Touch and Go Records—“made with 100% Recyclable Material which is PVC & Phthalates Free and uses 79% less CO₂ to produce”—Shellac record.Of course, the crucial difference with this particular Shellac record, their sixth, is that frontman Steve Albini passed away from a heart attack at age 61, just 10 days before its release. It’s hard to wave away the tragic circumstances clouding it, especially when it concludes with a track called “I Don’t Fear Hell” where Albini delivers the smiling-through-clenched-teeth lines, “Something something something when this is over/Leap in my grave like the arms of a lover/And if there’s a heaven, I hope they’re havin’ fun, ’cause if there’s a hell I’m gonna know everyone.” Yet To All Trains is not an album overcast by death: It’s just one more example of how someone chose to live their life.Leading Big Black, Rapeman and, finally, math-rock trio Shellac, Albini spent 40 years dedicated to a singular vision of underground rock music that was no frills, free of overdubs, constructed with analog tools and constantly nattering with guitar tone that started shrill and slowly evolved into Morricone metal. Eminently dependable, Shellac were the Honda Civic of alternative rock—modest, reliable, generally affordable. You knew the drill. There was a new album every so often, but never too often, whenever the mood struck prolific studio engineer Albini, prolific mastering engineer Bob Weston, and working drum instructor Todd Trainer.Most of the things that made Shellac a great band in 2000 and 2007 and 2014 were already firmly bolted into place on their 1994 debut, At Action Park: the growl ’n’ skwonk, the bludgeoning repetition, the best-sounding drums around. They’re still here, too. Unlike similarly minimalism-minded rock bands like the Ramones, Motörhead, or AC/DC, you never had to worry that Shellac were going to fall prey to the creeping influence of modern production techniques or genre trends. Shellac songs would vacillate between rancorous and caustic (2000’s “Prayer to God""), hypnotic and caustic (2007’s “The End of Radio"") or funny and caustic (2014’s “All the Surveyors”), but no one was ever going to file a complaint to the Better Business Bureau about the ingredients on the label.To All Trains naturally walks the same path and, had circumstances permitted, would likely have been appreciated simply as little more than Shellac’s sixth excellent record. At a lean 28 minutes, it’s their shortest and most instantly rewardable—no instrumentals and none of the longform post-rock indulgences of 1998’s Terraform or 2007’s Excellent Italian Greyhound. Elements of the Minutemen were always lurking in Shellac’s music, but they seem especially pronounced in the groove-spiel of “Chick New Wave,” the sharp pauses of “Days Are Dogs” and the pro-labor screed “Scabby the Rat,” which plays like a funnier, less anxious version of Double Nickels on the Dime’s “West Germany.”",Rock,8.1
243,"Co-produced with Nashville’s Dave Cobb, the onetime boy bander’s new solo album is a coming-clean, “back to basics” record that hits like background music. Zayn’s solo career has been a series of fits and starts, a product of a modern pop landscape where being a talented singer is far from enough to capture the zeitgeist. It may have been a mistake to initially define himself by what he was not: not a Simon Cowell shill, not a squeaky-clean boy band idol, not above laborious concept albums. His chosen character of the brooding, afflicted Don Juan, provocative as it may be, is not exactly unique; even the Weeknd has begun working beyond its creative limits. And with ROOM UNDER THE STAIRS, Zayn seems to be finally casting off that tried-and-tested persona, at least to an extent.If you’ve ever tuned into SiriusXM’s The Coffee House station, you know what this album sounds like. Doing away with the pulsing, club-ready R&B of Zayn’s past solo work, Dave Cobb’s co-production paints a new backdrop of beachy guitar and live drums, playing into Zayn’s former One Direction role as the introspective crooner. “I’m finding my way on the highway this year,” he declares on “Concrete Kisses,” over sparkling keys and a meandering bassline. Recorded at his home in rural Pennsylvania, this is apparently meant to be Zayn’s coming-clean, “back to basics” record, channeling the likes of Chris Stapleton (another Cobb collaborator) and John Legend as a way of projecting sensitivity. The sound is pleasant enough, if a little too picturesque. The strongest entries are the trio of songs that Zayn didn’t co-write: “Stardust” is a gushy ode to new love, “Something in the Water” has Zayn doing his best Blonde impression, and “False Starts” carries a propulsion that’s sorely missing everywhere else.While not completely devoid of references to partying—“So fucked, I can’t feel my face”—ROOM UNDER THE STAIRS gestures towards a vaguer messiness of long-term relationships. “Take me as I am, I’m tired/Of dancing around the point,” Zayn sings on “What I Am,” then proceeds to spend the whole album doing just that. Apart from a few true groaners (“Got a big old cup of shit/Told me to drink it”), the lyrics are mostly forgettable mush, circuitous nothings like, “These days, I live to my depiction” (“Grateful”) or, “With no senses, ain’t no sentence/Making sense of us” (“Dreamin”). These garbled thoughts only reinforce the songs as background music—the soundtrack at a boardwalk cafe where you’re only meant to hear every third word, or the needle drops on reality TV whenever one contestant proposes to another. They’re not bad, per se, but they’re anonymous.ROOM UNDER THE STAIRS follows Zayn’s split from his on-again-off-again partner Gigi Hadid, which ended in 2021 when Zayn pleaded no contest to four charges of harassment for allegedly striking Hadid’s mother. Why, then, are relationship narratives on this album ambiguous to the point of meaninglessness? There’s a moment of startling emotional clarity on “Shoot at Will,” a revealing track where Zayn alludes to his and Hadid’s daughter: “When I look at her, all I see is you/When you look at her, do you see me too?” But for the most part, Zayn appears much more comfortable wearing the mask of vulnerability instead of actually exercising it.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

244,"After experiments with UK garage, club breaks, and more, the cheerfully chameleonic Atlanta producer turns his attention to dance punk; the results are as mischievous as ever. ESG, Liquid Liquid, and LCD Soundsystem; cowbells, scratchy guitars, and hi-hats—we all know how dance punk goes. But what if there was another way? This is the question that Atlanta producer Nikki Nair poses on Snake, having recently turned his attention to rethinking 2-step on his 2023 EP with Hudson Mohawke, Set the Roof.Collaborations have been a major part of Nair’s work so far; over the past two years, he has worked with everyone from Sam Binga to DJ ADHD—a mark of his flexible charm. Nair’s productions and DJ sets are defined by their eclecticism, swinging from UK garage to trance via IDM and pure pop. His range is admirable, but it makes it hard to pin down exactly who Nikki Nair is. The Snake EP redresses those uncertainties. At six tracks long, it ties with 2020’s Just Reduction as Nair’s longest solo release. More importantly, it is his most personal work yet. His family adopted the snake as their guardian—he calls them “a symbol of my life-force”—and the record’s sound is a homage to the DIY and punk scenes in which he grew up.Rather than raiding the well-worn dance-punk sound that the Rapture once called home, Nair pays tribute by selectively combining dance and punk tropes. “Worm” joins a ferocious electro-punk beat to a dirt-eating synth motif that sounds like Mr. Oizo gone screamo or Suicide at their most unhinged. “Prowler” has a crudely bedraggled riff worthy of the gnarliest rock deadbeat and a bassline that shrieks like a dubstep dinosaur; and “Snake” is the Prodigy after they’ve blown both studio speakers and label recording budget. Listeners who found the latest Justice album lacking in drama will encounter plenty of roaring filth to satisfy their needs, as will fans of Daft Punk’s rusty, rasping Human After All.Nair has said that the six tracks on the Snake EP were an outlet for his anger and frustration, which might explain the record’s overblown sound and occasional breakbeat fury. But the songs also reflect confusion and joy, a salmagundi of emotions that helps the EP to breathe beyond the slightly one-dimensional punk smashers at its core.The opening “Sugar Kingdom” is a contemplative electro number, bass-sprung but sparse and stumbling, to which Nair adds a spookily understated vocal, more gentle lie-down than John Lydon. The result is as fragile as a hummingbird egg. “Catenate,” which closes the EP, maps the improbably excellent overlap between UK garage and the cardigan twee of Sarah Records, a label whose fierce DIY spirit didn’t exactly translate into musical muscle. The lyrics, too, suggest a Field Mice B-side: “You look so fresh/In your brand new dress/I think I’ll drown,” Nair sings, with the amiable angst of someone who has just got his heart broken on Etsy.",Electronic,7.7
245,"The pop star teams with her brother Finneas for their third album together, expanding the cooly dark vision of their sound. It’s an honest and ambitious album when it’s not inert and repetitive. This is the least we’ve known about Billie Eilish going into an album. For years, the star’s journey was documented in yearly Vanity Fair interviews and candid documentaries; even Carpool Karaoke visited Eilish’s childhood home, where she still lived until recently. That seeming lack of boundaries between the pop star and her audience is increasingly standard for megastars, but Eilish’s intimate music made her a particularly strong candidate for parasociality. Her 2021 album, Happier Than Ever, was largely a response to public scrutiny, more reserved and mature than her 2019 debut, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? In the ensuing years, Eilish kept a low profile, surfacing every now and then to soundtrack a Pixar film or win an Oscar before retreating to work on the next record.To hear Eilish say it, the goal for HIT ME HARD AND SOFT was making an “album-ass album,” citing Coldplay’s Viva La Vida and Vince Staples’ Big Fish Theory as influences. Those records are also ambitious pop mini-epics where established artists show off their range, but there’s usually an outsider like Brian Eno or SOPHIE to get the musician out of their comfort zone. With Finneas once again at the helm, HMHAS is more of the same. For the first time, Eilish’s live drummer Andrew Marshall is on board, as well as the Attacca Quartet, playing arrangements orchestrated by Finneas and the prolific David Campbell. Never one to subscribe to a single genre, Eilish flits from minimalist trance to massive stadium rock, and the album has the same dense vocal layering and inventive percussion that make Finneas one of the most excessively documented producers in pop. But there’s no true swerve, just bigger versions of what they’ve already made—even Coldplay dabbled in shoegaze! What experimentation exists here demonstrates the siblings’ strengths and limitations as they enter their third project together, but it’s diminishing returns.Thematically, HMHAS focuses mostly on falling out of love with a narcissist (as documented on “Blue”) and falling in love with a woman for the first time. Opener “Skinny” teases another record about the perils of fame, in the vein of Happier Than Ever, and it’s hard not to blame her: When Eilish casually confirmed her bisexuality in a larger Variety profile, that’s all the press wanted to talk about. When it’s addressed on the album, it’s on her own terms, as if the years of insensitive “queerbaiting” accusations never happened. It’s hard to stand out in the age of Spotify-sanctioned sapphic playlists, but “Lunch” is delightful for its matter-of-fact sexuality and the record’s best line deliveries: “I bought you something rare/And I left it under… Claire.” Though the syncopated piano and guitar riffs recall the most generic of 2010s alt-pop, Eilish maintains her irreverence with double entendres and zilch-entendres (“I just want to get her off,” she mumbles). The “Last Christmas” chord progression of “Birds of a Feather” feels engineered to soundtrack wistful coming-of-age stories, and sure enough, you’ll find it in the trailer for the wistful coming-of-age Netflix show Heartstopper. Both these songs are uniquely effervescent departures in her catalogue, but they never sound like a pop star playing catchup to pop radio—just the earnest enthusiasm of someone falling in love.",Pop,6.8
246,"The Staten Island artist’s debut full-length collects dreamy R&B and punchy pop rap, chronicling stories of heartbreak and hookups with a cool, crowd-pleasing ease. The emergence of New York City’s sexy drill movement couldn’t have come at a better time for Staten Island native wolfacejoeyy. Though he’d already begun to hash out the particulars of his sound by the time Cash Cobain and Chow Lee dropped their pioneering 2 Slizzy 2 Sexy mixtape in 2022, joeyy was undergoing artistic growing pains. For the past few years, he’d been chopping it up in group chats with the underground’s then-buzziest upstarts, like SoFaygo, Slump6s, and Yung Fazo, exploring the moment’s pastel-streaked, melodic trap sound. Though he had a knack for writing the sticky, falsetto-laden choruses favored by his peers, joeyy’s more ambitious output indicated a desire to break from SoundCloud rap’s superficial and often overstimulating conventions.The best of his early cuts were refreshingly organic, backed by baroque string arrangements and mixed with comparatively subtle vocal processing chains. Those effects allowed joeyy to flex his impressive singing chops, while accenting the youthful idiosyncrasies in his voice. After notching a minor TikTok hit with the Jersey club-inspired “buku,” he joined Cash and Chow in the studio to record “weekend,” a gritty R&B track that foreshadowed the rawer sound of his more recent body of work. Trading prurient bars over disintegrated sub-bass and keyboard arpeggios straight out of a platformer video game’s aquatic level, joeyy was finally in his element: His starry-eyed idealism was the perfect foil for his collaborators’ endearing sleaze.“Weekend” appeared on last summer’s 22Joeyy EP, but seems to have catalyzed the aesthetic of Valentino, his first full-length album. Its beats center on quasi-acoustic timbres that suggest a “live” feel, instead of the synth-driven wizardry that has defined the recent wave of DIY pop rap. Jazzy piano chords creak and echo. Backing vocalists weave rich harmonies on “don’t be dishonest.” Fingerpicked guitars underscore interludes. This pursuit of intimacy also extends to joeyy’s pen. Wistfully recalling hookups in triplet flows and licentious detail, he tends to offer songcraft that is more story-driven and cohesive than the horny punchlines that have defined the subgenre thus far.Opener “stop trippin bout girls u don’t know” follows the trajectory of a short-lived situationship—from initial flirtation to the inevitable fallout that occurs when joeyy can’t commit. The track leaves out kicks and 808 pulses almost entirely, paring the production down to chirping hats, droning bass, and elegant synth brass layers. The roominess allows joeyy to experiment more easily: He makes short leaps into higher octaves and imbues the exchange between him and his love interest with voice-cracking intensity. The music may be dreamy ear candy, but the depth and structure of joeyy’s craft puts him a rung above his peers.",Rap,7.4
247,"Recasting Y2K British alt-pop for a new generation, the South London singer-songwriter’s debut tackles heartbreak and loss with humor and conviction. Professional declutterer Marie Kondo operates by a simple principle: Every item in her home must “spark joy” when she holds it. If not, it’s on the chopping block. The Japanese term for this now-popular phrase is “tokimeku,” which also literally describes a fluttering heart. Zimbabwean-English artist Rachel Chinouriri dedicates a song to Kondo on her debut, What a Devastating Turn of Events, now released in a deluxe edition. “I’m getting rid of everything/Starting with you,” she declares, her husky voice barely breaching a whisper. Throughout the album, Chinouriri is taking inventory—chasing the tingly feeling that comes with upending the status quo.“The kids are throwing up in the Garden,” she sings of regretful alcohol-filled nights in opener “Garden of Eden,” commencing the album’s theme of purging. The audible click of a cassette tape sets a nostalgic mood: With Sugababes and Lily Allen-inspired kiss-offs (“Never Need Me,” “It Is What It Is”) and thunderous production reminiscent of Coldplay (“The Hills,” “Cold Call”), Chinouriri reveals herself as a fan of the British pop and alternative artists of the noughties. Her neo-soul vocal modulations, internet-age references, and lyrics that center the experience of a dark-skinned woman—“I love myself/I love my skin”—separate her from predecessors. The 25-year-old musician developed a subdued singing style to pacify her family, who would periodically shush her during recording sessions. As grungy whirlpools of guitar threaten to drown her out on “The Hills” and “Cold Call,” she sounds like someone learning to yell for the first time in her life.What a Devastating Turn of Events documents a distinctly Black working-class experience of British life. On the cover, Chinouriri and her guitar stand in front of a council estate row house draped in miniature St. George’s Cross flags. “Really easy for you to pick and choose a woman worthy of your flat in West Croydon with those roadman shoes,” she taunts someone from her South London hometown. With their fluting vocals and bird chirps, her songs could fit on the soundtrack of Michaela Coel’s sitcom Chewing Gum, about a 24-year-old British-Ghanaian woman trying to lose her virginity. Through humor, pop hooks, and scenes of emotional intimacy, both works juxtapose the vibrancy of life with the drab realities of public housing.In her lyrics, Chinouriri tackles heavy themes of suicide, eating disorders, and depression without succumbing to internet brain rot. “Dumb Bitch Juice” may be a social media catchphrase, but Chinouriri’s bluesy tone of voice seems to emanate from an earlier era. “I’ll end up the one/Who pays all of the bills/While your family call me unstable,” she prophecizes, imagining herself giving up a bright future for the validation of a no-good man. She sings with a weariness like she’s lived this dynamic in a past life; more likely she’s simply witnessed it among an older generation. Deluding yourself into thinking you can turn a loser into a supportive partner happens to the best of us, as the accomplished BBC Radio 1 host Clara Amfo affirms in a closing radio drop.",Pop,7.5
248,"The New York psych-pop quartet returns with an album that finds compelling new ways to make mini-dramas of the mundane. Midway through Crumb’s new album, there’s a transitory, 49-second track called “Nightly News.” It’s groggy-sounding, a hazy sampler of cable-news synths and this-just-in swells; you get the sense that you’ve just woken up on the couch, and the TV is taunting you with whatever happened this time. Millions of cockroaches accidentally released from nearby research facility? Serial slasher last seen purchasing potato chips at local mini-mart? Nothing, it turns out: The song ends before revealing what the news actually is. It feels particularly apt for the New York band, who’ve spent the past near-decade churning out hypnotic epics with a sinister edge. In 2019, frontwoman Lila Ramani told Pitchfork that she wouldn’t “chill” to her group’s output. Dreamy as it is, their music is a wake-up call.Crumb aren’t the types to get eight hours of sleep. Their first two albums, 2019’s Jinx and 2021’s Ice Melt, seemed to revel in the space between 2 a.m. and daylight—not only because of their shared sound, a slightly unnerving take on psychedelia, but also the ideas that informed that sound, the sorts of things you have to dream up. If you asked them about Ice Melt’s underwater-y vocal mixes, they wouldn’t tell you about Ableton effects or post-session knob adjustments; they’d tell you how they put condoms on microphones and dunked them in buckets of water. Ramani sang of transient thoughts, fleeting curiosities about strawberry seeds (“BNR”) or dates with dark spirits (“Jinx”). AMAMA, the band’s third album, gets more playful and candid than ever, without sacrificing their signature red-eyed experimentation. It’s a sleeker, riskier, and more rewarding iteration of Crumb’s approach: proof that as their footprint has expanded, their palette has, too.Crumb take a microscope to foggy memories, gathering the ephemera of years spent staring through windows. They have roots in the New York scene—Ramani is an alum of Brooklyn ensemble Standing on the Corner; bassist Jesse Brotter appears on early tracks by MIKE—but their inventive jazz-psych invokes a wider set of peers, including Toronto’s BADBADNOTGOOD and Melbourne’s Hiatus Kaiyote. On “The Bug,” a hypnotic paean to caught flies and caught feelings, Ramani’s poetry is undergirded by a winding rhythm section that crawls like an insect. “Side by Side,” like the best Crumb songs, melds romance with vague mourning; when Ramani sings of “trying to run away” and the descending chord progression gives way to a feverish instrumental break, you get the sense that you’re running, too, but toward something—a seismic, supernatural encounter. Crumb’s music supplies a cinematic score for Ramani’s off-kilter scripts, slow-burn psychological thrillers that make you look over your shoulder, then at the world around you.",Rock,8.1
249,"On their new album, the New York band collides hardcore, dance punk, and hip-hop like a little kid smashing together action figures. It’s an exhilarating, refreshing, and inventive listen. In their music video for “In the Wawa (Convinced I Am God),” New York four-piece Lip Critic play avaricious record label execs, who realize the band (also portrayed by themselves) has stolen their masters. With the execs on their tails, Lip Critic incinerates the CDs with blowtorches, rendering them nothing more than melted plastic. The video exemplifies how the band approaches creation: like a hydra, cutting off one line of influence only to sprout new strands to experiment with. On their debut record, Lip Critic throws everything at you—dance punk, digital hardcore, heavy noise—and see if it’ll stick. At just over 30 minutes, this is an album of endurance and pure adrenaline; the mayhem makes Hex Dealer an exhilarating listen.The band officially came together while studying at SUNY Purchase in 2018. The Westchester school boasts alumni like Mitski, so Lip Critic’s harsher sound immediately clashed with their more indie rock-oriented cohorts, sometimes literally; frontman Bret Kaser recalls an online post complaining about noise from their band practices traveling across campus. Lip Critic’s ethos resembles Death Grips in their raw, uninhibited performances, but their thematic interests also approximate a more raucous iteration of fellow Brooklynites Model/Actriz. On opener “It’s the Magic,” where Death Grips’ influence is most evident, blown-out percussion pounds against Kaser’s vocals, echoing DG multi-instrumentalist Zach Hill’s uncompromising, primal drumming on “No Love,” one of their most recognizable tracks.Hex Dealer is a loose concept album about predatory preacher-types who resort to snake oil tactics to fulfill their craving for control. In this world, everything is a means to gain power, a façade to mask these characters’ true depravity. They numb their emptiness with overconsumption; whether that’s brand new jeans on “It’s the Magic,” trips to the butcher’s shop on “Bork Pelly,” or creating the ultimate gas station hoagie on “In the Wawa.”The album is a master class in genre-hopping, running the gamut of drum’n’bass, hip-hop, and ska. It feels as though Hex Dealer is a litmus test; take Lip Critic as they are or not at all. When “Love Will Redeem You” breaks out of the gate with pitched-up vocals and anxious percussion, it seems things can’t get any more abrasive—and yet there are still 10 songs to come. “The Heart” immediately follows, the tempo accelerates, the drums get harder, and the noise gets thicker and more suffocating. The con man at the center of the song grapples with his vices, and punctuated by Kaser’s rapid yelps, he convinces himself that he hasn’t succumbed to corruption.",Electronic,7.7
250,"The upstart Alabama rapper has big hype and a personality to match. His new full-length shows off a more human side. Yhapojj has the kind of outsized persona where he takes on the identity of a wolf, is anointed to knighthood via sword emojis in TikTok comments, and has a show shut down by NYPD—only to take the music into the streets and the skate park. Since 2020, he’s been triangulating his sound, somewhere between Isley Brothers, ILoveMakonnen, and Bangerz. On P.S. Fuck You, the 20-year-old Huntsville, Alabama rapper comes back down to Earth with a vulnerable and sometimes silly project that’s ultimately sort of fun but not that deep.Alongside teenage phenom Nettspend, Yhapojj has popularized “jerk” rap, a genre known for pitched-up, layered vocals and bass that will make your speakers sound broken. With many of jerk rap’s major players barely beyond their teens, its lyrics tend to capture classic adolescent attitudes like “no one understands me,” “I need her so bad,” and “let’s get fucked up tonight.” Yhapojj’s fans admire his combination of sad, crooning lyrics over loud, kinetic beats. Call it crying while acing your math exam, but that duality is foundational to P.S. Fuck You, where Yhapojj weaves between blaring horns, melodic piano, and thick bass as he reflects on his relationships and mindset.On the standout “Turnin Lane,” produced by Charlotte, North Carolina’s ok, Yhapojj ruminates about a lover he doesn’t want to leave, asking her which way she’s going to go in the turn lane—as well as complimenting her feet. He’s trying to convince us that he doesn’t care, but the song’s anxious desperation betrays him. Atop a triumphant horn-filled beat on “Feelings,” Yhapojj hopes all his friends get married—if only so he gets a chance to see his crush at the reception, which is sweet in a rom-com type of way.His change of vocal effects and the tone of his voice create different versions of Yhapojj to represent different parts of his personality. His delivery has a mountain of charisma to stand on, but a lack of musical variety is what really drags P.S. Fuck You down. The album features work by a number of young producers, like Atlanta’s FearDorian and jerk rap beatmaker Hhhcra, but it starts to run out of gas towards the end, and piano-based tracks like “Whats Up Wit” and “Touch Evb” blend together. While Yhapojj has used angel or werewolf imagery to create a hyperreal version of himself that made zany music, P.S. Fuck You portrays him as just a guy going through it. It feels raw and complex, but it leaves you hoping for just a touch more magic.",Rap,6.9
251,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit Judy Garland’s mythical 1961 live album, a late-career triumph that helped to outline the shape of queer fandom for decades to come. In a photograph snapped on the evening of April 23, 1961, a line of disembodied hands reach out to grasp for Judy Garland onstage at Carnegie Hall. They belonged to a group of men whose allegiance to the star was as passionate as it was fraught; as bound up in their identification with her strength and humor as with the many troubles of her life. Their cohort could only be spoken about in code, and in time, a whole vocabulary emerged to describe them: friends of Dorothy, the boys in the band, Best Judys. To journalists and outsiders they were objects of amusement, if not outright scorn: “the boys in tight trousers,” “ever-present bluebirds,” or as one writer bluntly called them, “a flutter of fags.”What’s most striking about this image is Garland’s responsiveness to the people connected to those flailing limbs. Her eyes are cast downward, reciprocating their gaze, engaging them as individuals rather than an undifferentiated mass. Most accounts of that evening are of a restless and animated audience, leaping out of their seats and swarming the footlights to be closer to the singer. According to one review, the fervor was so intense “you could not tell whether the crowd was clapping, shouting, screaming, laughing, or crying. The sound suddenly had no character. It was just an expression of total approval and acceptance.”“It was, even by the strictest definition, perfect,” Gerald Clarke, Garland’s biographer, wrote of her series of performances at the storied New York concert hall. But strict perfection is at odds with Garland’s enduring appeal. The expressiveness of her voice outpaced its technical merits. Her genius was using a flawed human instrument to communicate something far more complicated than a lovely song sung straight. She approached show tunes and pop standards with such unguarded emotion that they came to seem disarmingly personal, no matter how well-known or widely performed. Despite her music’s theatricality, the scrim separating the person from the performer was unusually thin: the draw of a Garland concert had as much to do with her glamorous presence as her unbridled singing.The mystique of Carnegie Hall was only enhanced by the success of its recording. Judy at Carnegie Hall spent 95 weeks on the charts and 13 of them at the No. 1 spot. It won several top awards at the 1962 Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, the first ever awarded to a woman. It was a record that lived up to the hyperbole of its liner notes and soon was widely known as “the greatest night in show business history.” After a sometimes rocky 1950s, it once again reaffirmed the star power Garland had always possessed, marking the moment when the singer and her audience were in perfect sync with one another; when the peak of her powers as an artist was met with the kind of sustained and unconditional recognition she’d always sought.",Pop,10
252,"Ambitiously remaking a 2002 ambient-glitch album with clarinet, vibraphone, cello, and other acoustic instruments, New York composer Joseph Branciforte discovers new depths in a minimalist classic. Why remake a classic? Comparison to the original is likely to cast even an extraordinary achievement in a bad light. Or so thought the composer and engineer Joseph Branciforte when Taylor Deupree approached him with the grandly ambitious—or perhaps wildly misguided—idea to create an acoustic version of his 2002 album Stil.. That record was a high water mark of the glitch movement, born of the moment in the late ’90s when personal computers became home studios. Deupree endlessly looped a handful of electronic samples slightly out of sync, allowing tiny digital artifacts to phase in and out of time like a Steve Reich composition at microscopic scale. Stil. is remarkably warm-sounding and emotive for such resolutely digital music, but impossible to imagine being played by actual humans. And yet, on October 10, 2021, Deupree sent an email to Branciforte requesting just that: “not sure if you’re familiar with the album... it’s very very repetitive... and i’d want it all played... not played for a bar and looped in pro tools.” Branciforte reluctantly agreed—on the condition that he could back out if it didn’t work.Though it’s Deupree’s name on the spine of Sti.ll, Branciforte is the mastermind behind the scenes. Only after they began did Deupree reveal that he no longer had the mix files for Stil.. Branciforte would have to rely on the finished recording itself for his transcriptions, a daunting task that required painstakingly isolating different frequency ranges for each track. Branciforte then recruited an ensemble of expert instrumentalists to pull off his exacting scores, including Madison Greenstone, whose extended techniques for clarinet are largely responsible for the album’s timbral character, and Ben Monder, a guitarist whose initial response to the proposal was simple: “That is a terrible idea.”Let’s put those doubts and misgivings to rest. Sti.ll works. The track that convinced Branciforte to keep going was “Temper,” Stil.’s busy, gyrating, IDM-inspired third track. He set about transcribing it for clarinet, dividing it into 16 layers and meticulously notating each one (an example of his extreme precision: Layer 11, titled “beeps,” has a tempo of 56.48 bpm, a level of specificity likely not perceptible to the human ear and certainly not playable with any degree of accuracy). Greenstone replicated the song’s thrumming static and jittery clicks with a range of techniques. For one layer, she used the clarinet’s keys to create percussive thumps of bass, and for another she continually pushed water through the mouthpiece to simulate the track’s crackly undercurrent. The results were revelatory: This was “Temper,” but it was something else too, a contemporary classical composition of arresting beauty.",Electronic,7.7
253,"Thirty years after stepping into the spotlight, the Portishead singer reintroduces herself with her debut solo album. History weighs heavy on her songs, but she takes pains to avoid her musical past. Beth Gibbons has made inactivity into an art form. In Portishead she sang as if hanging onto the microphone for dear life, her voice the embodiment of languorous misery. Her recorded output since then has arrived at a snail’s pace and her reputation has grown with each fallow year. Following the release of Portishead’s Third, in 2008, Gibbons has performed Górecki’s Symphony No. 3 with the Polish National Radio Symphony, featured on Kendrick Lamar’s “Mother I Sober,” and done precious little else in public. Gibbons does nothing that she doesn't have to and she does it in her own sweet time, which makes the arrival of Lives Outgrown feel like a revelatory occasion.So why did Lives Outgrown bring Gibbons out of her shell? And why now? “People started dying,” she said. Three full decades after Portishead first appeared on the scene, she reintroduces herself with an album inspired by goodbyes, informed by the kind of perspective that’s only possible by looking backward. She added, “When you’re young, you never know the endings, you don’t know how it’s going to pan out.” At the heart of Lives Outgrown is a push and pull between past, present, and future, with Gibbons delving into her personal history for inspiration, while studiously avoiding the palette that made Portishead so beloved.Stylistically, Lives Outgrown approaches folk music, thanks to its acoustic guitars and strings; but it feels denser, louder, and more exploratory, like stumbling across a junkyard deep in the forest. Unusual textures abound: In “Tell Me Who You Are Today,” producer James Ford (of Simian Mobile Disco) strikes piano strings with metal spoons; for another track, he and Gibbons spin whirly tubes over their heads, in search of the perfect creepy tone.Melodies of endless melancholy and lyrics of pointed depth, reminiscent of Gibbons’ work with Portishead and (briefly) Rustin Man, her duo with Talk Talk’s Paul Webb, reflect the singer’s period of self-reflection. Lives Outgrown has moments of crushing relatability, as she tackles subjects like motherhood, anxiety, and menopause, her unvarnished humanity a world away from the otherworldly rage she inhabited on Third. “Without control/I’m heading toward a boundary/That divides us/Reminds us,” she sings on “Floating on a Moment,” striking a beautifully sparse rhythm and tone, while the opening couplet of “Ocean” (“I fake in the morning, a stake to relieve/I never noticed the pain I proceed”) distills years of dull suffering into two elegant lines. Her melodies are strong as iron: The elegantly inevitable “Floating on a Moment” and cathartic album closer “Whispering Love” are among the best songs that Gibbons has put her name to.",Experimental,8.0
254,"Despite its technical mastery, the English producer’s debut full-length struggles to deliver on the emotional revelation it promises. When I. JORDAN spoke to Pitchfork in 2020, they weren’t getting their hopes up about the future. Their lofty ambition was to live in Berlin—“like every other DJ”—but they doubted they’d ever be successful enough to make that viable. They were, of course, being modest. By then, Jordan had already released a string of EPs that gushed with energy and emotion, blending UK rave styles with trance and the sunny thump of French house. Crucially, there was a personal element, too. 2020’s For You was a dedication to their younger self, an out-of-place queer teenager in the working-class northern English town of Doncaster. Four years later, Jordan has blown past those early doubts. Since 2021, they’ve found a home for their music on Ninja Tune, the prestigious and long-running London powerhouse. They’re now a fixture on the international club and festival circuit; Mixmag listed them as one of the 25 DJs who defined 2023. All the while, Jordan has kept their personal story front and center, chronicling their gender transition on social media and offering a real, humble, and empowering presence to their fans.Sometime in the midst of this meteoric rise, Jordan’s music lost some of its magic. Early EPs like DNT STP MY LV, For You, and Watch Out! are beautiful, ecstatic, and overflowing with feeling in a way that makes you want to do more than dance—cry, maybe, or stage dive. But since around the time of their 2022 collab with Fred Again.., their tunes have felt glossy and flat, drained of intensity. I AM JORDAN, their debut full-length, is, in concept, a bravely personal record, celebrating Jordan’s self-realization, queer community, and working-class roots. Musically, though, it is strangely hollow, full of tracks that are technically well-executed but emotionally unmoving. In spite of its high tempos, rave clichés (police sirens, canned spinbacks, a Shephard tone), and rowdy hints of donk and hard house, it only occasionally achieves liftoff.The album’s best track is “People Want Nice Things,” an ethereal banger that chronicles Jordan’s transition in a clever and subtle way: To track how their voice dropped when they started taking T, they recorded themself saying the title phrase once every month for 10 months, then used those recordings as the song’s central vocal sample. But the rest of the album feels less distinctive and artistically assured than Jordan’s early records. The first single, “Real Hot n Naughty,” is a collaboration with the actor and dancer Felix Mufti. Jordan says they aimed to create “a real queer northern dance anthem” with this one, which feels like a big promise for a bit of shiny organ house with jokey Scouse raps on top.",Electronic,6.6
255,"The British singer-songwriter’s harrowing, physical folk music forces you to confront an awful and awesome kind of beauty. When Keeley Forsyth sings, you become acutely aware of the body emitting her voice. Not what it looks like, necessarily—not its age or shape or gender or skin color—but its raw physicality, its fundament of bones and sinew. She sings with her whole chest: diaphragm tightening, air filling the lungs, muscles twisting up the length of her throat, unleashing a presence that drips with the blood of the flesh that produced it. Some singers try to make their art sound effortless; Forsyth emphasizes the physical strain.Perhaps this sound was born of desperation. In 2017, Forsyth, who has been acting professionally since she was a teenager—mostly on British television, though she also has recent credits in Guardians of the Galaxy and Poor Things—suffered a psychological and physical breakdown that left her tongue paralyzed for a month. The desperation of that experience was palpable on her 2020 debut, Debris, an album of haunted minimalist folk that she released at the age of 40. Limbs, which followed in 2022, was more conventionally beautiful. But on The Hollow, her third album, she puts her gale-force vibrato in the service of her most intense music yet.“I’ve always enjoyed making people feel a bit uncomfortable with the sounds and music I make,” Forsyth once told The Quietus; here, it sometimes feels as if she wants to terrify. The album begins with stately restraint; over slow-moving organ tones, her voice mournful and controlled, she sketches an agonizing search for meaning intercut with a single jarring image of physical desolation, “Veins like dry stalks/That can never bring water.” The title track, which follows, begins with liturgical grace, but her voice—digitally layered, quavering severely—assumes the sound of a sob lodged in the throat, her words at first nearly unintelligible. A dirgelike mantra (“There is no help here/Not for me”) gives way to a startling cry—“Shake my life/Out of my mouth”—delivered with larynx-rending force.Forsyth and her producer, Ross Downes, continue to channel the same influences that informed her previous music, principally Scott Walker’s Tilt and Meredith Monk, along with the spiritual yearning of Arvo Pärt and the cerebral goth of This Mortal Coil. Even when she raises the hairs on the back of your neck, she evokes an awesome, awful beauty. On “Eve,” she offers a tender tribute to her grandmother, who raised her: “Nothing can/Tear us apart/Let the body lay down/And die.” (On The Hollow, even the songs in a major key are about death.) On “Turning,” she is borne aloft, chanting and bellowing on the surging floodwaters of Colin Stetson’s arpeggiated saxophone; it’s a romantic landscape painting rendered in sound.",Experimental,7.7
256,"The Quebecois singer and guitarist transforms French and English folk ballads into songs where hoary tradition yields boldly contemporary sounds. Myriam Gendron’s Mayday marks the obvious evolution of a songwriter who cut her teeth busking Leonard Cohen songs in the Paris Metro, whose 2021 release Ma délire - songs of love, lost and found reimagined traditional Quebec folk songs. These are direct, grounded dispatches from the collective unconscious, melodies for sweeping floors or felling trees or mourning that might have existed forever. Between her 2014 debut, Not So Deep as a Well, where Gendron put Dorothy Parker’s poetry to music, and the new record, the Montreal-based artist has sharpened her set of timeworn tools: voice and guitar strings, as fleet and restless as a sparrow in her hands.Gendron’s voice is earthy and unadorned, a Swiss Army knife that can cut stoic or wistful. One part Fairport Convention and one part Josephine Foster, her warble takes songs like “Look Down That Lonesome Road” and roots them even more deeply in folk tradition, yielding a sound that would be just as at home blaring from a gramophone as it would a forest clearing. Within one listen of a song like “Terres Brulées” (“Burnt Earth”), you can sing the melody back, as if retrieving it from a buried memory. Lyrically, these songs are soil-covered and windswept, sung alternately in English and French. “J’inventerai des aubes constellées d’hirondelles/J’écorcherai le froid tout gris qui nous appelle,” she sings (“I’ll invent dawns studded with swallows/I’ll scratch the cold gray that calls to us”). Later, on “Quand j’étais jeune et belle” (“When I was young and pretty”), she describes a lover soaked and chilled by the rain, who proposes they should marry under the branches of an oak.But the record’s brightest moments happen when the traditional brushes against the hyper-modern, like a match against kindling. The electrified strumming of closer “Berceuse” collides spectacularly with the free-jazz screech of Zoh Amba’s saxophone, and Marisa Anderson’s riffs on “Long Way Home” electrify Gendron’s tale of being tossed asunder, alone on the ocean. Jim White’s fevered drumming on album highlight “Lully Lullay” reads like a restless mind tethered to a sturdy pair of feet, the push-pull between Gendron’s slow, steady refrain and the frenzied cymbals driving a compelling tension. Mayday’s best songs are unsettled and kinetic, living organisms in a state of flux. With roots in the traditional—“Lully Lullay” was inspired by the Appalachian variant of the 16th-century English “Coventry Carol,” for example—these tracks walk the tightrope between the deeply familiar and the abstract, suggesting lullabies with serrated edges. For “Berceuse,” that’s more literal—in French, Gendron sings “Go to sleep, my daughter,” before the freaky saxophone tugs us towards the surreal.The track order dilutes some of this magic. Album opener “There Is No East or West,” a peripatetic acoustic melody, feels like a drawn-out preamble to the more compelling snap of “Long Way Home,” with its drums like a pulsing heart. Starting at such a low simmer before the second song’s cresting chorus—“Oh mother, other/Make my bed”—is a gamble, and it risks mislabeling an otherwise dynamic LP.Yet like a devastating Dorothy Parker couplet, a 500-year old carol, or the opening bars of “Suzanne,” there are moments on Mayday that feel essential, plucked out of the ether as if they’ve always existed. These chimeras of the past and present illustrate what Gendron does best—digging up timeless sounds only to disrupt them, reenvisioning what’s timeless for this precise moment.",Folk,7.7
257,"The expansive debut from the Berlin-based artist features many guests from the fringes of ambient electronic music. It’s a crinkly, supple, meditative opus. Across Dust Devil, a notionally ambient electronic double album, Naemi—a Kansan now based in Berlin—crafts songs that rise and fall gently. Each one has a strong point of view but a brittle feel, like they began as sharp statements before the producer whittled them away to nothing. Indeed, like weather.gov says rather poetically about the tornado-like phenomenon that gives the album its name, each song arrives in a haze and when “depleted or the balance is broken,” “will break down and dissipate.” It’s a soft and magical album, big on ambition and small in scale, which is, in my opinion, the proper amount of each.Naemi, who previously produced under the name Exael, is a member of a loose crew of musicians from Kansas and beyond—most notably Ulla and Huerco S., both of whom appear on the album—working in the more expansive side of electronic music. Expect to hear sweeping vistas of sound, ping-ponging synths, slow laser beams melting across muffled hi-hats, acoustic guitars weaponized into fractal dissonance. These decrepit acoustics share the anti-melody principles of no wave music but not the abrasiveness. The album is quirky, but it’s easy to listen to. Suppleness is part of the approach.Dust Devil is the opus of this sound, with Naemi gathering together a murderer’s row of young experimentalists as featured guests, talented people who dot the Bandcamps of Motion Ward or 3 X L, whose label head, Shy, appears on this album. They perform an array of musical talents, spoken-word poetry, strumming an acoustic guitar, or cooing the sweetest of nothings over beats that gurgle, buzz, and pulse.The album opens with “It Feels So Good” featuring “Erika”—who is also known as the fairly popular R&B musician Erika de Casier; so much more well known is she than the rest of the artists it feels like they thought it would be gauche to use her full name—a hazy sweep of sound. The song could easily have been an instrumental; alone it would be a nice piece of ambient music, made of the gentlest version of something between a baby whale’s call and the digitized sound of a trumpet mixed with a harp-like digital twinkle. But with de Casier’s singing, which she does slow and soft enough that she’s almost whispering, the song turns from relaxing to seductive. Brian Eno could never. “It Feels So Good” is likely the closest thing the album has to a “song.” It’s a smart choice to have it open the album, a proper immersion into the album’s warmth before journeying onto the next 13 songs which blur together as they flit in and out of cohesion. Ideas are developed, actualized, and abandoned. There’s not always a ton of development, but not much preciousness either; curiosity reigns.",Electronic,8.0
258,"With singular grace and flair, Yaya Bey deepens her connection to homespun funk and R&B while transforming grief, insecurities, and depletion into a full embrace of life. Losing someone close to you can feel like a rupture in time. How can the sun continue to rise? How can the world keep moving? The disorientation of being fundamentally altered in grief motivates Yaya Bey’s transcendent new album, Ten Fold. “My nigga left the world and the world ain’t stop,” she quietly raps on “yvette’s cooking show.” The Queens-raised artist recorded the album in the year following the death of her father, Ayub Bey—the emcee and producer Grand Daddy I.U., who was a member of the pioneering hip-hop collective Juice Crew and a towering figure in Bey’s life. Funeral costs compelled her to keep working and over the course of a year, she made music without any firm plans. The results, whittled down to 16 tracks, are snapshots of an artist moving through loss as she navigates financial and emotional precarity and the vicissitudes of romance. It’s a finely detailed portrait of grief that also celebrates the fullness of life.The ripples of Yaya Bey’s day-to-day are small, but in her delicate hands, they are strikingly resonant. Ten Fold rarely dwells on the past, choosing instead to mark the passage of time by cataloging the feelings that sprouted along the way—sadness, defiance, joy, frustration, pride, love. Masterful sequencing and economical writing (most songs are under three minutes) allow Bey to be as nimble as ever. After announcing the grief that “weighs heavy” on her, she briskly wipes her tears to celebrate her blooming potential on the pocket-disco song “chrysanthemums.” She finds “fly shit” at the thrift store on “east coast mami” to project the confidence needed to make power moves. Relationships fizzle and grow; rent remains too damn high. Collectively, the album sounds like a Black woman just trying to get by.In keeping with her 2022 breakout album, Remember Your North Star, Bey pulls from the warmer colors of a Black musical palette—Soulquarians-style neo-soul, upbeat funk, house, and boom bap. The production, assisted by Corey Fonville of the genre-melding jazz-hop band Butcher Brown, feels cozy and self-soothing. She taps into familiarity, yet resists complacency. The album opens with the simmering melancholy of “crying through my teeth,” which like its spiritual ancestor “Didn’t Cha Know,” carries a world of feeling in the simplest of phrases. Where songs like “nobody knows” on North Star described vivid characters and scenes, Ten Fold’s stories are abstract, unfolding like an extended inner monologue. The spare house beat of “sir princess bad bitch” is demo-like, and its circular refrain (“The beautiful thing about me/Is every little beautiful thing/Is on its way to me”) sounds like the kind of made-up song you sing to keep yourself afloat. Directing the affirmations inward allows Bey to skillfully sidestep platitudes: feelings arise spontaneously and inconstantly from all across the emotional spectrum. Even the songs explicitly about other people feel insular, like the blooming romance of “slow dancing in the kitchen.” The sunny reggae cut has the gossamer quality of a daydream or a gaze directed toward a lover.",Pop,8.3
259,"As hip-hop’s elite ice him out, the Atlanta star tries to keep the good times rolling. These may sound like the catchy Gunna songs of the past, but they don’t feel like them. Let’s be real: You knew what One of Wun sounded like before you pressed play. Gunna’s motor-mouthed tales of the high life here, his dreary piano ballads there. His last album a Gift & a Curse wasn’t a whole lot different; neither was the one before that. Glazed, melodic raps about clothes and girls and whatever jewelry he wore to the studio that day are Gunna’s bread and butter. That is the formula that has made him one of the biggest Atlanta rappers of the last decade. Though these days it feels like even Gunna is getting bored, spicing it up risks derailing the money train.Despite his considerable success, in the last two years Gunna has been unofficially shunned from the inner circles of popular rap by hip-hop cornballs who have interpreted his plea deal in the YSL RICO case as “snitching.” (Kendrick recently made him the butt of the joke on his Drake diss “Euphoria” when he said, “I know some shit about niggas that make Gunna Wunna look like a saint.”) The situation hangs over One of Wun, clearly weighing on Gunna even as he tiptoes around those frustrations to keep the good vibes intact. He’s trying to have the best of both worlds: An ol’ fashioned light and fun Gunna flex-a-thon, sprinkled with a reflective bar or wistful tune every now and then. Tonally, it’s confusing. Nobody wants Gunna’s pain rap album or his Me Against the World, but I do want him to be real with us.Back in the day, when Gunna sung about the way his “Fear of God pants match his Fear of God Vans” on Drip Season 3’s “Almighty,” or his “AP blacker than Akon” on WUNNA’s eponymous track, he sounded as if nothing else in the world mattered to him more. Now his boasts of having the sharpest outfit at the Met Gala (“One of Wun”) or a new Balenciaga crop top (“Prada Dem”) feel obligatory. I don’t doubt that he still gets fits off regularly, but we all know he has so much more at the top of his mind. It comes off as a deflection.He’s making songs that sound like catchy Gunna songs of the past—he’s still able to float on these laid-back, skittering ATL trap variants while reading straight off his SSENSE receipt—but they don’t feel like them. He’s going through the motions. His rapidfire flow on “Hakuna Matata” is clean but the energy is flat (he should have saved it for the soundtrack of Barry Jenkins’ upcoming Mufasa movie). He’s made “On One Tonight,” with its humming beat and limp croons, a dozen times before. I do still get a kick out of his latest sexual escapades (at the gym, on a yacht, in an orgy) and luxury car purchases—the extremely chill “Back in the A” is a standout, especially when he says, “My car is a half million dollars/I came a long way from Impalas”—but he’s so checked out that a couple of vivid bars can’t hide that he’s wearing a mask.",Rap,5.7
260,"The long-teased sequel to his cult-classic mixtape is a highlight in the Chicago rapper’s career, bringing the first-wave drill he helped popularize screaming into the future. At just 28, Chief Keef has churned out dozens of projects in nearly as many different styles. His influence can be felt from rap’s top rung like Playboi Carti and Lil Uzi Vert to the toasted digital landscapes of new-age acolytes like Xaviersobased and Devstacks. He’s one of the pioneers of the Chicago drill sound, and while there have been peaks and valleys—being a volume shooter often comes at the expense of a spotless track record—he’s never lost the thrilling “Lex Luger and Brick Squad dipped in the Chicago River” quality he’s been honing since the “Faneto” days. Even when he’d miss, the boldness of his experiments kept heads intrigued.One of those peaks was 2013’s Almighty So, a mixtape where Keef and a slew of producers melded drill with the chirpy cloud-rap-adjacent aesthetic that would soon populate SoundCloud. Street rappers weren’t spitting over production like Yung Lan’s “Ape Shit” or Abe Beats’ “Young Rambos” back then, and that adventurousness, coupled with bars comparing guns to dildos, turned Almighty So into a cult classic among fans and slightly younger contemporaries. Between arrests, label disputes, and being blacklisted from shows in his home city (until recently), Keef’s been through a lot on and off the mic over the last decade. Through it all, a sequel to Almighty So, first announced in 2018, has lingered in the margins. Despite Keef’s reservations about being hooked on drugs during that era, it garnered the kind of mythic status usually reserved for alt-rap team-ups and AAA albums that never were. But Almighty So 2 is real, as vibrant and busy and flippant as anything Keef’s ever made, a capstone that brings the first-wave drill he helped popularize screaming into the future.What stands out most about Almighty So 2 is just how different it is compared to the original. As opposed to hiring a dozen producers, Keef employs himself on all but one of 16 tracks. So 1 is airy and saturated, the audio equivalent of watching a neon sign flicker and short out. So 2 crashes in like the Kool-Aid man, leaving a trail of sticky footprints. It also borrows and mutates elements from other Keef extravaganzas: The Trap-A-Holics tributes dotted across this year’s Mike WiLL Made-It collab Dirty Nachos seem to have influenced the drops for fake radio station 4NEM Radio that pop up here; Ghanaian-Liberian comedian Michael Blackson, whose interludes powered much of 2013’s Bang Part 2, is back and desperately trying to make his DJ Drama-esque ad-libs funny. But these would just be nostalgic touches without Keef and his co-producers’ enveloping beats. On “Jesus Skit,” Blackson’s cloying bit about Black entertainers getting reparations is drowned out by Keef, Slowburnz, and MBZ’s production, their hellish keyboard stabs and Gatling-gun drums transitioning smoothly into Keef and longtime collaborator Lil Gnar’s verses on “Jesus.” It’s an update on an older formula that is fuller and more ambitious.",Rap,8.4
261,"On its second post-comeback album, the Scottish duo turns its narrative attention to human behavior in the digital age, to incisive and occasionally nihilistic ends. While Arab Strap always seemed out of step with overground indie-rock trends during their Y2k-era initial run, the Scottish duo’s second act couldn’t have been more perfectly timed—and not just because the current UK indie landscape is over-populated with melody-averse monologists sharing vivid slice-of-life vignettes with a painterly touch. Their first album in 16 years, As Days Get Dark, arrived in early 2021 in the thick of the pandemic, and its thematic concerns—from social media addiction to the porn habits that fill the void in sexless relationships—perfectly aligned with a moment when much of our communication became mediated through screens, and the chasm between virtual connectivity and IRL isolation was widening at a perilous pace. For a hyper-analytical songwriter like Aidan Moffat, all the subsequent cultural turmoil that COVID helped spawn is the gift that keeps on giving.In a pre-smartphone era, Moffat and partner Malcolm Middleton were the novelistic narrators of twentysomething Scottish life and all the awkward conversations that transpire after the pubs clear out for the night. Now, with their second post-comeback effort, I’m totally fine with it 👍 don’t give a fuck anymore 👍, they stand among indie rock’s most astute observers of human behavior in the digital age. Listening to these songs still feels like you’re eavesdropping on Moffat’s intimate exchanges and innermost thoughts, but now, more than ever, his narratives are firmly plugged into our unsettled collective consciousness. Moffat probably could have written the lyrics to “Sociometer Blues” back in 1998, as a window into a disintegrating dysfunctional relationship: “You take all my time, you take all my strength, you steal my love, you are the worst friend I ever had.” But the sense of exasperation and desperation is amplified upon realizing the song’s object of desire is his mobile device.Critiquing technology’s dissociative effects is hardly the hottest take, and this isn’t even the only new indie-rock album on the subject to come out this week. But where so much of the discussion around being Extremely Online usually centers on mental health—the way the internet feeds on both ego and insecurity, and how its endless flow of information atomizes attention spans into milliseconds—I’m totally fine with it’s imposing opener, “Allatonceness,” catalogs its corrosive effects in corporeal terms. The song begins with the sound of an old-school modem making a dial-up connection—a cheeky callback from a band that was born at the dawn of the home-internet era, but also an instant-villain origin story of how we got to our current hellscape overpopulated by sedentary keyboard warriors with “atrophied legs.” The song’s queasy, quicksand-thick bass groove further reinforces the symbiotic relationship between habitual computer usage and physical stagnation.",Rock,7.8
262,"Nyege Nyege’s latest snapshot of Tanzanian singeli pairs an avant-garde producer with a local keyboardist; the high-BPM results sound like a loose, extremely weird jam session. Tanzanian producer Sisso’s eponymous Dar es Salaam studio represents the cutting edge of the singeli genre. Singeli is hardly underground in Tanzania, but its relentless speeds of over 200 BPM provide ample room for experimentation, and thanks to the efforts of Uganda’s Nyege Nyege label—started by two European expats to chronicle East Africa’s fertile electronic underground—its more extreme exponents have picked up more steam abroad than relatively pop-friendly artists like Msaga Sumu. Records like Bamba Pana’s Poaa, DJ Travella’s Mr. Mixondo or Sisso’s own Mateso showcased the Terminator-tough side of the genre, but Singeli Ya Maajabu, Sisso’s new collaboration with keyboardist Maiko, sounds more like an informal, extremely weird jam session.Drum-machine loops gallop forward with the momentum of a cursorial prey animal, while gobstopping sounds sketch out simple musical motifs. “Kivinje” opens with a blitz of sirens and horn-honk synths, and it might take a few listens to notice that they’re playing a classic set of chord changes, I-IV-V-IV, the same as rock classics like “Louie Louie” and “Wild Thing.” Later, the duo eschews “musical” cues entirely, enriching the landscape with aqueous effects (“Mizuka”) and bubble noises (“Kazi Ipo”). Maiko’s synth leads ascend to an almost neoclassical beauty, finding new and simple ways to trace familiar chord progressions.While regional club scenes like singeli are often praised abroad for their supposedly sui generis futurism, Sisso and Maiko draw from a wide palette, maintaining a running conversation with other experimental club scenes. The influence of juke is unmistakable on “Kiboko”; “Mizuka” is a desolate expanse of glass-shard sounds and horror-movie creaks not far removed from Marie Davidson’s “The Tunnel”; and the minute-long “Mangwale” pastes together fluttering choir samples into the album’s only ambient respite. Yet these distinctions tend to vanish beneath the sheer onslaught of the music. Even at a hair shy of 40 minutes, this is a maelstrom of an album, and in an environment devoid of opportunities to go as decisively buck as your typical singeli crowd, listening to Singeli Ya Maajabu might feel like hiking up a mountain through a hailstorm, or maybe playing an N64 game based on Gorguts’ Obscura.There’s nothing like the almost Charlemagne Palestine-like relentlessness of Bamba Pana’s “Biti Three,” but Singeli Ya Maajabu still requires a high tolerance for treble and abrasion. This is true of much of the most cutting-edge pop music in the last few years, from the blown-out rage-rap on Opium to the mind-boggling breakdowns of Brazilian funk to the chipmunk fantasias of hyperpop. Maybe “annoying” is one of the last frontiers the modern-day listener has to cross to find the world’s most vital music, but then, rock’n’roll sounded like noise to Frank Sinatra. Your parents probably aren’t going to enjoy Singeli Ya Maajabu, but once it teaches you how to listen to it, it twists the brain like nothing else.",Electronic,7.4
263,"Filtered through warped hip-hop beats and garbled samples, Damon McMahon’s self-produced sixth album is a characteristically oblique apocalypse tale about living for today. Amen Dunes’ music is persuasive, but it’s not always clear what it’s trying to persuade you of. Since the release of his confrontationally noisy debut album, DIA, 15 years ago, Damon McMahon has continually refined the remit of his sound—shaving away the haze, juicing the elements drawn from pop and classic rock—but kept the narratives relatively oblique. Listening to his last album, 2018’s Freedom, felt a little like trying to read a Great American Novel by holding it up to a reflecting pool: ideas about loss and familial ties cut through, even if entire sentences were tough to string together. It was a personal record, but rarely a clarifying one; you got the sense that McMahon would rather keep his lyrics obscure than boil down his ideas into something digestible.The ideas on Death Jokes, his self-produced sixth album, are clearer. He is blunter and more forceful with specific meaning on this album than ever. Broadly, it is an apocalypse tale, in which humanity’s final moments on Earth are plagued by the same ills that have stalked us for centuries: hatred, greed, puritanism. Misunderstanding is a recurring theme, as is loneliness, specifically the kind that arises when the state fails to take care of its citizens. For all this pessimism, though, McMahon’s take on life, which he returns to again and again on Death Jokes, is simple and optimistic: “Some day we lose it/So use it.”These ideas are filtered through warped hip-hop and rave beats, although the peculiarities of McMahon’s phrasing and melodies—his music is always surging or undulating, rarely taking a streamlined route—mean that Death Jokes sounds quintessentially Amen Dunes. Whether bleating over a sputtering 909 on the Lil Peep-inspired “Rugby Child” or singing an electro-reggae lullaby on “Purple Land,” McMahon is at a point in his career where he could never be mistaken for anyone else, and although Death Jokes is filled with odd details, like the minimal techno interlude “Predator” or the garbled lo-fi samples at the end of “Boys,” the muscular melodic lines that emerged on Freedom and 2014’s Love still come through.That connection with the rest of McMahon’s music is welcome, because Death Jokes can be hard to parse, and would seem hammily provocative in the wrong light. It opens with a sample of a Woody Allen joke, and on the stunning, nine-minute penultimate track “Round the World,” essentially the final song before a track made entirely of samples, he sings about kids “getting stoned/On their phones/They’re so lonely and don’t know why.” But McMahon never seems like he’s tut-tutting or finger-wagging so much as appealing for forgiveness and generosity. On “Mary Anne,” a pastoral country ballad addressed to one of the women who sexually abused him as a child, he sounds compassionate (“In Purgatory, we both got lost/When we meet again, we will catch up love”) but terse (“I know you say who we are is the same/Well we aren’t the same.”) Other songs, like “Boys” and “Rugby Child,” are portraits of violent people driven by forces they can’t fully control. It doesn’t feel like McMahon is exalting victimhood, or condemning some vague concept of “cancel culture,” as much as trying to find shades of gray in an increasingly black-and-white world.",Rock,7.6
264,"On his first album in six years, Tom Krell shrouds labyrinthine songs in distortion and slips down referential rabbit holes. The extremes can be daunting, but the highs are ecstatic. For nearly 15 years, How to Dress Well has resisted simple pleasures. On Love Remains, Tom Krell’s 2010 breakthrough under the alias, he drowned R&B melodies in dense production, obscuring straightforward sounds with reverb, distortion, and disjointed lyrics about death and desire. Even at his most accessible, Krell’s approach to pop music has been outré. His two best albums, 2012’s Total Loss and 2014’s “What Is This Heart?”, twisted songs that Whitney Houston could’ve sung into skittery, ethereal gems, like imaginary Top 40 hits encountered in a dream. A skilled deconstructionist, he dismantles familiar forms and pop archetypes, repurposes their core parts, and uncovers labyrinths buried beneath.Krell’s latest album, I Am Toward You, is his first release in six years and undoubtedly his most difficult yet. He constructs an idiosyncratic world of field recordings and ephemera, muffled soul singing and glitchy guitar samples, mournful melodic detours and buzzing electronic drops. It’s frequently blissful and self-consciously beautiful, yet its hooks are elusive—you won’t find a new “& It Was U” or “Repeat Pleasure” here. Lead single “No Light” is dominated by a harshly distorted lead riff that offsets the magic of its dance-pop backbeat, the vocals overdriven to the point of erasure. Even when his choices are less abrasive and more tuneful—like the straight-line strutter “On It and Around It” or the hymnlike a cappella “The Only True Joy on Earth”—the songs have an opaque, hazy quality. They seem to creep their way to transcendence, as if they’ve been floating in memory and are just now announcing their presence.But like any How to Dress Well project, I Am Toward You asks to be accepted on its own terms, free from preconceptions. A number of breathtaking moments offer inroads to immediacy even during strenuously experimental stretches that otherwise may keep you at arm’s length. Krell uses his raw falsetto less than he used to but still deploys it to powerful effect on “nothingprayer” and “A Secret Within the Voice.” Standout “Song in the Middle” is a slow-building accretion of loops that evokes a surge of strong emotions—anxiety, longing, hard-earned optimism. “A Faint Glow Through a Window of Thin Bone (That’s How My Fate Is Shown)” features a string and piano breakdown that’s as moving as anything in the How to Dress Well catalog. Even in its quieter passages, I Am Toward You discards clean, predictable patterns to judder and zag with obsessive intensity.In an eight-page, 4000-word exegesis Krell wrote to accompany the album, he describes it as a “transcendental poetic effort of great contemplation, confusion, unknowing, and prayerfulness… populated by birds, stones, contingencies, confusion, God, and fate, which takes up the task of becoming oneself, the intergenerational transmission of trauma, the meaning and experience of art and music, the mediation of all of this by technology.” Krell's lyrics are as impressive as they are disorienting, crammed with social critiques, psychoanalytic formulations, poetic wordplay, Greek myth, and Bataille references. “I guess I once confused the German word for face with the word for history/Just change one little letter, see your fate in the mirror,” he sings on “Contingency/Necessity (Modality of Fate),” a meditation on the interplay between historical narrative and personal experience.",Pop,7.1
265,"With her forceful contralto and skyscraping pop-rock, the Los Angeles songwriter’s second album is a dramatic chronicle of exiting young adulthood into an uncertain future. Time comes for us all, but Hana Vu is taking it harder than most. “There’s no song in my heart like I thought there was when I was young,” she wallows on the first song of her second album, Romanticism. It’s the kind of lament that a more restrained songwriter might make with melancholic resignation, but Vu doesn’t do quiet emotions: She bellows the line as if she’s been mortally wounded or awoken to find the sun stricken from the sky. She’s not just getting older—the very fabric of her being is slipping through her fingers, and she’s wrecked. On Romanticism, Vu channels her despondence into such titanic pop and gleaming rock that you don’t feel her pain so much as marvel at the magnificence of its display. She sings with an operatic authority that makes even her most hyperbolic assertions land as indisputable truth. “I scream so loud/Because I don’t exist no more,” she writhes over glammy twinned guitars on the album’s rousing farewell to youth “22,” her unrelenting voice prodding the song to a Bowie-esque climax. The irony that she’s still in her early 20s isn’t lost on her, but she has such command over her voice that she really does seem old beyond her years. Her keening contralto envelops the song as if it’s been conjured from an ocean of epsom salt.Just imagine how some of the label A&R in her native Los Angeles might have tried to mold her rock instincts for maximum return: play up the soaring guitars, tie her into a “Gen Z can rock, too” narrative, and perhaps encourage her to throw shade at the state of popular music in interviews. Everybody involved would probably make a mint. Vu’s own vision isn’t nearly so prefabricated. It’s much more nuanced and amenable to the times, a complement to the stately gloom of Mitski, the TikTok sadness of Boygenius, and the alt-rock ear candy of Olivia Rodrigo. For all its insularity—she wrote the album alone and recorded it almost entirely with just one other musician, Jackson Phillips of the dream-pop project Day Wave—Vu’s music is unmistakably a product of this moment.Depression’s unliftable curse hangs heavy over the album. On “Hammer,” Vu pleads for a cure to an ailment her doctor can’t diagnose: “There is no answer/But I want one anyway.” Romanticism’s tone lightens on its more resigned B-side, as tense rock gives way to driftier, dreamier material, but Vu’s malaise never clears, despite her attempts to harness the power of positive thinking. Over a tentative dance-pop pulse, “Dreams” imagines an existence where “it doesn’t hurt to be alive,” while “Airplane” sets a lovelorn fantasy to the buoyant pop-rock of the Killers. A closing suite of three more love songs challenges the core assertions of the album’s first half, suggesting the root of Vu’s anguish might be romantic, not just existential.Vu’s been kicking around the Los Angeles music scene since she was 14, which may explain in part why she carries herself like such an old soul. She also lost a prime chunk of her youth to pandemic, time she can’t get back. On Romanticism, she grieves the past not just out of nostalgia for something that’s been lost, but also trepidation about the future. “Do you remember getting older?/Can you tell me what it’s about?” she sings on “Airplane.” It’s one of the rare moments on the album when she sounds hopeful, as if knowing might take some of the worry away, but of course, nobody can tell her precisely how adulthood will unfold. That’s what makes it so frightening.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

266,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit Fishmans’ 1996 masterpiece, a landmark of Japanese rock that fits a lifetime of aspirations and daydreams into a single 35-minute composition. The prospect of making an album with only one gargantuan song was one of those tossed-off comments that seemed like a joke. But when Shinji Sato put forth the idea, he was following a trajectory that defined his life: dream big, and see it through to completion. Long Season, the 1996 magnum opus of Japanese rock band Fishmans, was a radical proposition: take an existing track—the group’s six-minute single “Season”—and turn it into a dreamlike suite that elevates their gentle psych-pop to symphonic proportions. “When we made [Something in the Air], I hated having each song separated from the next,” Sato said of their previous full-length. “Why not just make it one song?”No longer bound by single-digit runtimes, the band crafted a record that was massive in scope but suffused with everyday warmth. A mesmerizing piano motif and rocksteady bassline set the foundation while Sato’s bright and guileless voice floats above. He sounds friendly, like an affectionate drunk filling a room with positive energy, playfully stretching syllables and delivering them with easygoing charm. When he doesn’t sing, the rest of the instrumentation gets to breathe, expand, and sometimes go haywire. Crucially, Long Season does not sound like a jam session; each passage is a self-contained world of sound that serves the drifting, daydream logic of the overall piece.Sato, Fishmans’ vocalist, guitarist, and charismatic leader, showed signs of the sort of ambition and tenacity needed to pull off a grand-scale project like Long Season from a young age. He was already a known presence at Meiji Gakuin University’s Song Writes Club when drummer Kin-ichi Motegi attended an event for new students. Motegi was stunned: “From the moment he started singing, [Sato] had an aura on another level.” Soon, the two started jamming together, and in 1987 they started a band, joined eventually by guitarist Kensuke Ojima, keyboardist Hakase-Sun, and bassist Yuzuru Kashiwabara.Considering the sweeping art-pop of their greatest album, Fishmans had something of an inauspicious beginning: They were a reggae band. Japanese artists had been exploring reggae for more than a decade by the early 1990s, but their vocalists had a more professional style than Sato’s scrappy and childlike delivery. Fishmans’ debut, 1991’s Chappie, Don’t Cry, flopped commercially and critically, and a follow-up single, which doubled as the theme for a short-lived television show, didn’t fare much better. One journalist accused the band of having “no reggae soul.”Early in his career, Sato had written down his goals, many of which involved success in the music business and his social life. He wanted money, he wanted people to hear his songs, he wanted popularity with girls. After their debut LP and early singles failed to make them stars, Sato and the rest of the band began to lose their faith in the industry. Fishmans had to make a decision: Would they focus on more TV tie-ins to help with sales, or pursue artistic freedom? They agreed on the latter. Suddenly, Sato had a new direction in life. “I don’t want to make it big,” he wrote in his journal. “Media interferes with creative activities. There’s a lot we should be doing in the Japanese music scene.”",Rock,9.3
267,"In keeping with the film’s surreal take on nostalgia, a crew of leftfield pop and indie musicians—Caroline Polachek, Bartees Strange, Jay Som, yeule—pay knowing tribute to the ’90s. Art and youth form unshakeable bonds in I Saw the TV Glow, director Jane Schoenbrun’s melancholy and claustrophobic document of suburban outsiderdom. Schoenbrun has spoken in interviews about how, as a child, they opted to process their identity through fiction rather than “actually look in the mirror and figure out who I was.” With I Saw the TV Glow, they put a surreal spin on the way beloved cultural objects give us an outlet for hard-to-express feelings. At the heart of the film—the director’s first since their acclaimed loner internet horror We’re All Going to the World’s Fair—are two teenage characters obsessed with the mysteries and mythos of The Pink Opaque, a weekly half-hour monster-of-the-week TV show in the campily terrifying vein of Buffy the Vampire Slayer or The X-Files. Watching the show, the characters find an outlet for their feelings of isolation—and as the borders between their physical existence and the world of The Pink Opaque melt, they eventually come to wonder if their memories of the series might be more real than reality.The soundtrack seems designed to provoke similarly intense reactions among its listeners. In addition to a ghostly score from Alex G—who returns after his work on We’re All Going to the World’s Fair—the film features a robust collection of original songs from artists that inspire feverish fandom not unlike the characters’ obsession with The Pink Opaque. Collecting tracks from hushed singer-songwriters (Florist, Maria BC), fuzz-scuffed indie-rock artists (Bartees Strange, Jay Som), and off-kilter pop acts (Caroline Polachek, yeule), it feels moody and homespun, a sure recipe for cultish devotion—like a CD-R with a tracklist written in Sharpie, passed around a group of friends amid reverent whispers.The film is firmly rooted in the imagery and cultural touchstones of the 1990s—characters muse about the looks of Evan Dando and Michael Stipe, and posters for Sarah Records are pinned to their walls. And though the soundtrack is full of artists from the 2020s, most of them reach for sounds that evoke the end of the 20th century. Jay Som’s “If I Could” is lit by a gleaming guitar riff that chimes as brightly as Bandwagonesque. Sadurn’s slide-guitar-smeared “How Can I Get Out?” plays like a hazy memory of the mellower songwriters on Drag City in the ’90s. Even Polachek sidelines her sleek synth-pop contortions in favor of anthemic shoegaze on “Starburned and Unkissed.” Though the reference points are clear, the songs never feel too reverential—they’re often loose and deliberately otherworldly, as if heard in the depths of a dream.That approach is clearest on yeule’s cover of Broken Social Scene’s “Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old Girl.” On its surface, it’s a gloomy trailercore rendition of a song that’s long been an unofficial hymn for teenaged outcasts—an especially on-the-nose choice to kick off a film about adolescent alienation. But underneath the track’s heavy-lidded surface is something stranger: a distant memory of the original, scoured by glitches, with vocals that slip and swirl around the meditative backing track. Where Broken Social Scene’s recording is rhythmically locked in and mantra-like, yeule’s version is distant and dissociative, a bedridden memory of adolescence long since passed. The soundtrack’s most sweeping emotional gesture, yeule’s song also offers the most vivid illustration of the film’s delight in bending linear time. Both I Saw the TV Glow and its soundtrack begin in ways that feel familiar and nostalgic before diving back into the shadows, rendering beloved youthful memories unrecognizably strange.",A24,7.1
268,"In his most directly political album yet, the Tuareg guitarist lets his solos become the sound of his fury when his Tamasheq lyrics aren’t enough. Uranium extraction is backbreaking work. Workers spend hours in the mines operating heavy machinery while risking exposure to radioactive chemicals. In Niger, uranium comprises almost its entire export product, but its government sees virtually none of the profit. Instead, France, its former colonial occupier, still controls most of the country’s supply, using the minerals to power a third of its domestic electricity while almost 90 percent of Nigerien citizens are left without access to power. And though France finally relinquished all military bases in Niger following a 2023 military coup, many of its mines remain active to this day, leaking radon into the water supply of surrounding towns.On his new album Funeral for Justice, Tuareg guitarist Mdou Moctar addresses these abuses directly. “Why does your ear only heed France and America?/Occupiers are carving up your lands/Gallantly marching all over your resources,” he sings in his native Tamasheq on its title track. You might not pick up on all of the finer details from listening to the first song from Moctar’s monumental new album, but it’s hard to miss the sound of righteous fury in its opening guitar chords, which ricochet like the first shots in battle. When speaking to The New York Times, Moctar said he wanted to make his guitar sound like a person crying for help, or the piercing cry of an ambulance’s siren. In his most directly political album yet, Moctar lets his solos become the sound of his fury when his Tamasheq lyrics aren’t enough.“I make music to make people smile,” Moctar recently told Crack, and so far, that music has garnered him plenty of success among Western audiences. Just a few weeks ago, Moctar and his exceptional live band—Souleymane Ibrahim on percussion, Ahmoudou Madassane on rhythm guitar, and Mikey Coltun on bass—took the stage at Coachella to bring their exhilarating live show to their biggest crowd yet. At that performance, Moctar himself couldn’t help but grin as he stepped away from the mic and began one of his now legendary solos, his fingers nimbly dancing across both the body and fretboard of his lefty guitar, stacking melodies atop each other until they seemed to take on a life of their own.Perhaps it’s no coincidence that the lyrics scan as an immediate plea to the American audiences: “My people are crying while you laugh/All you do is watch.” And perhaps just to get his point across more fiercely, Mdou Moctar does not shy away from power chords or distortion, instead leaning into the anger and power of the D.C. punk scene that birthed bassist and producer Coltun on “Funeral for Justice.” “Sousoume Tamacheq” is a synthesis of these ideas, meshing a breakneck rhythm section with the sounds of traditional Tuareg instruments like the three-string fretless tehardent or the gourd-shaped calabash. The result is an exuberant and enraged call for Tamasheq unity that sounds just as urgent as it reads on the page.",Rock,8.4
269,"With more ambitious melodies, bolder harmonies, and compositional complexity, the Chicago trio’s new album hypercharges their already electric sound. Dehd is as much a rock band as they are a viable alternative to Red Bull. The Chicago trio’s previous two—great, but relatively interchangeable—albums, 2020’s Flower of Devotion and 2022’s Blue Skies, established Dehd as something you reach for when you want to feel hypercharged. Singer Emily Kempf’s vocals have the endearing, squealing quality of a hog call, and Jason Balla makes the guitar sound like his strings are fruit-colored rubber bands. Their music offers a reliable path to sun-kissed paradise, if your version necessitates dirty knees and sticky fingers. But on Dehd’s latest album, Poetry, the band tries the backroads. With more ambitious melodies and compositional complexity, Dehd sends a lightning bolt through their already electric sound.All they needed was a binding agent. Balla notes in press materials that he, Kempf, and drummer Eric McGrady approached writing Poetry differently than past albums. They abandoned their typical roles—McGrady exercising his yogic restraint over the drum kit, Kempf spilling her voice all over the mic—in favor of experimentation. Balla recalls how they’d all “bounce around the room playing different instruments, dreaming up different ideas” and summoning the red-hot energy they felt when the band was younger. The result is worthwhile: Poetry still pulses like summer, but Dehd sounds more cohesive than ever.Forest layers of guitar and echoed vocals replace the ponytail swing of Blue Skies. Still, Balla often sings with charming indifference, like he found the lyrics crumpled in his back pocket. “It’s a lover, soft undressing,” he muses with Kempf on the headrush “Dog Days,” only to finish the next line with a statement of apathy: “It’s a, ugh, whatever.” His reedy voice and Kempf’s gunshot shouting have always mixed together well, like sparkling water and soda syrup. But Poetry elevates their natural chemistry with bold harmonies. The two trade light da-da-da’s and lazy ahh’s on the yearning “So Good,” as if they’re playing dentist. When McGrady’s drum starts to rumble, it feels like Earth is parting for the song’s true message: “I’m bad at this love thing/You’ll probably mean nothing.”Dehd tackle the same topics with a missing-tooth grin: addictive love, pain, being a happy outsider in spite of these things. Despite the cringey loftiness that a title Poetry suggests, they consistently deliver sensible Bob Seger jams, like “Shake,” on which Kempf huffs out big breaths, as if she’s using them to keep herself cool. The poetry is in the mundane, they suggest. It’s in all the disparate pieces that come together to form one mosaic, your one life. That sense of quotidian beauty is especially palpable on “Pure Gold,” in which McGrady’s drums sway like blossoms in a windy wildflower field. Kempf and Balla chant triumphantly, proclaiming that it’s all “Easy, breezy/Ooh, yeah/We laugh so freely.” Their instruments no longer rub against each other like dry sticks, as they would on past albums—instead, they melt together like popsicles.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

270,"On the Kentucky metalcore band’s titanic fourth album, they’ve amplified and concentrated their sound into something so potent that it has its own gravitational pull. The verdict on You Won’t Go Before You’re Supposed To appears to be well settled among the Knocked Loose faithful. That’s if the reaction videos for “Blinding Faith” are to be trusted—and they probably should, since the lead single of the Kentucky quintet’s titanic fourth album is all reaction shots: That’s a seven-string Ibanez Iceman; oh shit, a SECOND breakdown; 3 members of the band screaming within 5 seconds is fucking god-tier. That’s not entirely accurate because Bryan Garris is not really screaming, but making a death metal gurgle so heinous that it can’t be compared to any actual vocalizing so much as Banned from TV, Joe Theismann’s leg injury or the Alien chest-burster.But can Knocked Loose break out? This sort of question has surrounded the band since they appeared at both Coachella and Bonnaroo in 2023, not just as each festival’s biggest draw in contemporary metal, but the only one, an emissary for the totality of heavy musics for the most casual but curious of listeners. If You Won’t Go Before You’re Supposed To draws this demographic, it does so as the exact opposite of a “crossover event.” Rather than expanding outward, Knocked Loose have amplified and concentrated their aesthetic into something so dense that it has its own gravitational pull.So, despite what you might assume from those Slipknot opening gigs and the presence of a producer who’s worked with NLE Choppa, Beartooth, and Disturbed in the past two years, there are no clean vocals, no alt-metal choruses or wavy trap drums, no rage-rap guest verses. In short, nothing that might suggest Knocked Loose had reached their logical endpoint with a concept album about a fatal car wreck and could only make their heavy heavier by contrast. They’re a hardcore band in practice, an action/horror franchise in spirit, one that takes its escalating success as a mandate to re-up a self-imposed arms race—the stunts, the thrills, the killshots, they all need to be bigger, badder and bolder before something hungrier takes its place.And if the breakdown has indeed replaced the riff as modern metal’s lingua franca, You Won’t Go Before You’re Supposed To is about as eloquent as it gets. Bring back the nasty riff but slower? Maybe that was enough in 2016, but “Piece By Piece” is going to bring in a new nasty riff and also an ultra-hammered China cymbal that sounds even gnarlier. Half-time breakdowns? “Thirst” achieves the heretofore inconceivable quarter-time tempo switch, while the Southern shuffle riff on “The Calm That Keeps You Awake” turns Pantera’s “Walk” into a funeral procession. The breakdown on “Don’t Reach For Me” hits, but mostly because there’s at least a half-dozen little teasers of silence where it doesn’t happen first.",Metal,8.0
271,"As he closes the books on PC Music, label founder A. G. Cook unspools a rangy triple album full of shiny synths, inside jokes, and gently sentimental vocal pop. The logic of today’s pop culture is lore, and the keepers of the lore are the fandoms. As recently observed in the Swiftieverse, the stans cannot live on songs alone—they demand worldbuilding. They shall have Easter eggs. They will make video essays about whether or not Harry Styles wears a wig. These are ideal conditions for A. G. Cook, the producer and persona at the heart of the PC Music universe. His third solo full-length is a dizzying concept album that spills over into animated videos, bespoke websites, and several millennia’s worth of made-up lore. Appearing in the midst of the megawatt rollout for Brat, the Charli XCX album on which Cook returns as a lead producer, Britpop was never going to be the biggest pop album of the year as measured by social clout—but it just might be the biggest by volume.As his first album since the end of PC Music, the era-defining experimental pop label that ceased releasing new music last year after a decade, Britpop follows 2020’s seven-disc solo sprawl 7G and its rapid sequel, the dense and ambitious Apple. This time around he’s kept a lid on things—it’s a comparatively tight triple album, eight tracks per disc, arranged along the themes of past, present, and future (a classic tarot spread, not coincidentally). It’s also a sprawling multimedia project complete with characters, timelines, online games, videos, and bonus downloads accessed via three familiar-looking websites: Wandcamp, Wheatport, and Witchfork. (All three were recently “acquired by an undisclosed multidimensional conglomerate,” according to a pop-up.)In a way, the PC Music enterprise was always about making websites, as Cook—a computer nerd before he became a musician—explained to DIY back in 2014. While a complete hermeneutics of the Cookverse is beyond the scope of an album review (and would spoil the quest) the video for “Soulbreaker” might be the place to start: a time-traveling animation by Gustaf Holtenäs that’s stuffed with lore to be decoded by the faithful of the PC Music subreddit.Britpop begins in the Past, with the first disc a kind of epitaph to PC Music’s now-classic sound, a shiny playground of boing-splat colors and neon noise. It sounds like Cook is tying up loose ends, perhaps emptying the archives. There are mallow-soft synths and stinging trance supersaws, hairsprayed ’80s syndrums and speedy riffs recalling the “impossible music” of early influence Conlon Nancarrow. Hyper-chopped helium vocals appear in various states of disarray, from Charli XCX trilling “Brit-brit-brit like Britpop” on the title track to the shattered verbiage of “Prismatic.” The third disc is on similar ground musically but with a few more solidly structured songs and, on “Butterfly Craft,” a very un-PC excursion into cable-tangled radiophonic noise.",Electronic,7.8
272,"Trying to harness the overwhelming rush of big feelings, the 23-year-old singer channels a heady mix of styles—jazz, Indian raga, Gregorian chant—but sometimes falls back on bland lyrical aphorisms. Sitting in the backless hot seat of NPR’s Tiny Desk earlier this month, Willow seemed more uninhibited and confident than ever. That’s a change of pace for an artist who’s existed under the harsh microscope of celebrity her entire life. But here, backed by bass, guitar, piano, and drums, she swayed and beamed like no one was watching. She “just wants to feel it and be in the vibe,” Willow said on a call beforehand, a predictably heady desire that nonetheless suited the band’s sleek renditions of old and new songs. They gave the peppy twang of her 2015 megahit “Wait a Minute!” a sloping, jazzy remix falling somewhere between Alanis Morissette and Esperanza Spalding, and they sanded down the light pop-punk edges of her cathartic 2022 ballad “Split,” putting more emphasis on her breathy falsetto. But a version of “symptom of life,” a single from her new album empathogen, best illuminated the next phase in Willow’s evolution. Over crawling bass riffs, drums, and siren-like guitar, Willow articulated ideas about pain and anxiety she’s been picking at her whole career: “It’s like a turtle in the sand/Making way to the ocean/Almost meeting the end/Because the birds are in motion.” On empathogen, she follows suit, keeping things poetic without getting too sappy, staring mortality in the face while she begins the musical healing process in earnest.Willow’s musical and philosophical wanderlust over the last nine years has been exhausting—Annunaki-referencing neo-soul, Travis Barker-indebted pop-punk, empowerment-core odes to feeling feelings and rocking out. She’s never been short on ideas, but even the best of her earlier work lands like freehand graffiti writing; colorful and expressive, sure, but often lacking the focus and precision of stenciled graf. empathogen is the closest she’s come to not just channeling but harnessing the rawness of self-acceptance in young adulthood. It’s her most mature and well-rounded offering yet, though her writing can sometimes be as surface-level as an abandoned tweet draft.The punk and metal influences of her last two albums have been pushed to the margins by a more ambitious fusion: “jazz, funk, and a little bit of pop,” as she recently told Vogue Australia, along with Indian raga, what she calls the “indigenous, ceremonial vibes” of Native American throat singing, and Gregorian chant. This hybrid gives shapes to the sprawling “false self,” which combines funky bass, deep drum blasts, and stacked vocals that swell and contract like the vague panic attack Willow describes in its hook. “I wanna crash, feel so attacked/On a mad dash in my own brain… Am I insane? Feel the answer change each day,” she sings, the music doing much of the heavy lifting. Thankfully, there are no treatises on phone addiction and only a few pie-in-the-sky paeans to spirituality on empathogen. But Willow’s lyrics often lean on bland aphorisms that gesture at emotional reconciliation instead of actually going there. “Don’t ask questions/When life’s expressing/Itself through you and speaking the truth,” she reads from your aunt’s latest Facebook post on “between i and she.” Album closer “b i g f e e l i n g s” has a chorus that begins, “I have such big feelings”; it sounds ripped from a rejected High School Musical: The Musical: The Series script. These had me longing for more moments like “‘i know that face.’,” where the pep talk she gives herself for running from her darkest thoughts is as urgent as its staccato delivery and syncopated jazz ensemble production.",Rock,6.8
273,"N/A Michael Mayer first encountered Olaf Dettinger in 1997, at a party in Bautzen, a small East German town halfway between Dresden and the Polish border. Dettinger played an opening set of battle-style Chicago hard house—a far cry from the mischievous minimal techno that Mayer had packed his crate with—and presented the visiting headliner with a demo tape of his productions. Mayer wasn’t wowed by the demo’s relatively straightforward club tracks, which paled in comparison to the squirrelly, idiosyncratic music that Mayer and his friends in Cologne—Wolfgang and Reinhard Voigt, Jürgen Paape, and Jorg Bürger, among others—were putting out via a tangled web of labels and an even more chaotic array of aliases, a network they’d established out of their hometown’s Delerium record store. The music wasn’t bad, Mayer told Dettinger, but he found the sound derivative and the choice of instruments—a standard array of Roland 303, 808, 909, and the like—predictable. Besides, he added, in Cologne they’d moved from drum machines to samplers, a shift that had opened up new possibilities in sound design.A few weeks later, another cassette turned up in Mayer’s mailbox. Dettinger hadn’t just gotten the memo; the new tape was so in line with the sounds coming out of Cologne that he might as well have been one of them. The boom-ticking beats were ruthlessly reduced, and they swam in a strange wash of filtered chords whose source was impossible to place. There was a clear affinity with the dub techno of Wolfgang Voigt’s Studio 1 project, but Dettinger’s peculiar mix of grungy sonics and crisp drums stood on its own. One song was particularly striking: It sampled the pastel swirl of “The Ghost Has No Name,” from the Cocteau Twins and Harold Budd’s 1986 album The Moon and the Melodies, provocatively mixing techno rhythms, ambient atmospheres, and pop melodies—precisely the blend at the heart of so much of the Cologne scene’s music.8 Songs That Sample Cocteau Twins, From Arca to The WeekndMayer and his crew signed the tracks for their New Trance Atlantic label and ordered a test pressing. But before they could manufacture the EP, they made a fateful decision. The jumble of imprints had gotten out of hand. It was time to tie off the spiraling list of labels—New Trance Atlantic, Profan, Auftrieb, etc.—and bring all their projects under one roof: Kompakt. Following an inaugural EP from Jürgen Paape, a co-founder of the new enterprise, Dettinger’s Blond EP, originally slated as NTA017, became the second release on the new label, followed a few records later by Dettinger’s even more adventurous Puma. The two 12""s helped establish the fledgling outlet as the source of some of Germany’s most exciting dance music of the era. But Kompakt had yet another ace up their sleeves: Intershop, Dettinger’s debut album and the label’s inaugural full-length, which would follow Puma a month later, in May 1999. Newly remastered and reissued—and pressed on vinyl for the first time—Intershop captures Kompakt at a pivotal moment in its evolution, branching out from club 12""s into a new world of home-listening music.",Electronic,8.3
274,"Thirteen years after Trish Keenan’s death, a collection of her demos, home recordings, and voice notes offers an intimate and at times heartbreaking look at her otherworldly genius. In 1975, a time-traveling being from a distant but familiar realm left an indelible imprint on Trish Keenan’s mind. The titular character from Sky, one of a crop of bizarre British sci-fi shows supposedly made for children in the ’60s and ’70s, speaks with a cold, eerie affect, his voice warped slightly by tight echo. When exercising his telepathic powers, Sky stares down the barrel of the camera, his eyes and splayed palm imbued with a crude chroma-key glow. James Cargill, who formed Broadcast with Keenan in 1995, spoke of Sky’s deep influence on the band during a 2009 interview with XLR8R. He cited the show’s cocoon of white noise and paranoid, spectral atmosphere as key building blocks to Broadcast’s brand of retro-futurist psychedelia. In promotional photos, Keenan often emulated Sky, bathed in oversaturated colors and stretching her hand toward the viewer. She always seemed extemporal, as though her icy contralto and surrealist lyrics were beamed in from some far corner of time and space. When Keenan died of pneumonia in 2011, it was tragic not only for the sudden loss of a brilliant, exploratory musician, but because a portal to some other dimension had been permanently closed.On what would’ve been Keenan’s 43rd birthday, a mere eight months after her death, Cargill posted “The Song Before the Song Comes Out” to his SoundCloud page. The 40-second recording features an out-of-breath Keenan singing a quick tune, seemingly struck by inspiration in the middle of a walk. In the background, beneath a soft static buzz, you can hear her footsteps keeping time. The melody unspools gracefully, as if it’s a lullaby she’s known her whole life, the occasional fudged note a product of overthinking the intrinsic. Despite its brevity, the demo recording captures what made Broadcast so special: the hypnagogic interplay of childlike melodies and the noise surrounding them.In November of 2011, The Guardian that he was constructing a new Broadcast record from Keenan’s massive trove of home recordings. It would be a monument to her preternatural talent, a fitting cap to the too-short Broadcast arc. That album never came, but for several years, Cargill kept a tradition of sharing one or two of Keenan’s demos on her birthday. It was a gift to perpetually heartbroken fans who trawled Soulseek and YouTube for any unheard scraps of the band’s particular magic. Over time, the links died and Cargill’s blog posts slowed to a trickle, but devoted heads doubled as archivists, preserving the songs on YouTube and Reddit. In 2022, Warp continued the fan service and deepened the band’s legacy by releasing Maida Vale, a selection of the band’s BBC studio recordings, along with reissues of two previously tour-only LPs, Mictotronics and Mother Is the Milky Way. Now, with Spell Blanket: Collected Demos 2006-2009, we finally get to hear what an album of new Broadcast material could have sounded like. It compiles 36 demos (including “The Song Before the Song Comes Out,” “Petal Alphabet,” and “Tunnel View,” all of which Cargill previously posted) into a warm and sprawling 65-minute tribute to Trish Keenan, providing an intimate look into her otherworldly genius.",Electronic,8.5
275,"On their first new album since 2010, the veteran art-punks sound surprisingly mature, even sentimental. Fortunately they still know how to rage. It’s always ironic hearing Tim Harrington sing pleas for human connection after a career spent exemplifying the very qualities most likely to drive others away. The megaphone-voiced frontman of Les Savy Fav quills the band’s art-punk with brash volume and hectoring sarcasm. At the band’s legendarily rambunctious live shows, he sacrifices safety and dignity alike for the sake of an unforgettable spectacle. He’s as naturally gifted a showman as punk singers come, and one of the last guys you’d assume is all that concerned with whether or not he’s dating material. Nonetheless, as Les Savy Fav have aged into an institution, Harrington has increasingly exposed his softer side, writing often about the difficulty of maintaining close personal relationships. It can be odd, hearing the same wildman famed for stripping down to a Speedo on stage and scaling the tallest object within sight earnestly sing lines like, “It’s hard to let love in when we’re so scared of getting hurt” on the group’s sixth album OUI, LSF (on a song titled “Somebody Needs a Hug,” at that).Released after a 14-year recording hiatus during which the group occasionally toured but mostly focused on their day jobs, including bassist Syd Butler and guitarist Seth Jabour’s gigs anchoring the unlikely house band for Late Night with Seth Meyers, OUI, LSF continues the sentimental streak that ran through its predecessor, Root for Ruin. On the tender “Dawn Patrol,” Harrington finds solace in the reassuring touch of his partner’s hand. In its somber counterpart “Don’t Mind Me,” he croons about love that’s faded into mere tolerance over time. It’s the most naked, openly weepy ballad he’s ever attempted.One could argue that Harrington’s growing sincerity has made Les Savy Fav a better-rounded band. It’s certainly given them a wider range of moods. Yet as with Root for Ruin, OUI, LSF can’t completely shake the sense that its comedown songs are taking up space that could have been filled by bangers. Thankfully, this band can still rage convincingly when it counts: The album opens with an absolute pressure cooker, “Guzzle Blood,” which funnels their heated art-rock through the Prodigy’s five-alarm noise factory, all bleating squall and blaring horns. “Void Moon” and “Oi! Division” are both economical pit-starters, showcases for searing riffs and Harrington’s frontman-as-Russian-roulette volatility. At times, the maturity flatters. One of Harrington’s periodic forays into Penthouse Forum territory, “Limo Scene,” calls back to the lurid sex of “The Equestrian,” but this time amid all the touching and pheromones, the detail he lingers on is a simple gesture of consent and affirmation, a whispered “I’m into this.” The album’s stabs at youthful irreverence are less graceful. With its hokey appropriations of old LL Cool J and Usher lyrics, “Legendary Tippers” pushes the band into stale dad-joke territory. It’s a nod to an earlier, sillier era of the band, a past they can’t fully let go of even though they’ve outgrown it.Like their peer Marnie Stern, who returned from a similarly long studio hiatus last year with an album that picked up exactly where the last one left off, Les Savy Fav aren’t humoring any notions of reinvention. When you’ve got a sound this singular, this established, this irreplicable, there’s no shame in letting it ride. Still, given how time has always intrigued Les Savy Fav—their essential 2004 compilation Inches flaunted their evolution by collecting seven years of singles in reverse chronological order —it’s a little disappointing that the latest album doesn’t have more to show for the passage of so much of it. Twice the span that Inches documented has elapsed since Root for Ruin, yet OUI, LSF plays more like a continuation than a new chapter.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

276,"On his third album as bandleader, the star saxophonist tries to balance his habitual gravitas with a newfound sense of fun. But party music doesn’t come to him as naturally as heroic high drama. Kamasi Washington likes to go big. The star saxophonist and bandleader’s debut album was a 3xLP extravaganza appositely titled The Epic. The follow-up, Heaven and Earth, was a bit briefer—only two hours this time—but even more ambitious. Fearless Movement, the third full-length with his name on the spine, shows signs of scaling back and relaxing. Its runtime is a comparatively lean 86 minutes. The third track is a Zapp cover; George Clinton shows up a couple tunes later on a funk jam called “Get Lit.” There are guest verses from a few different rappers, little-known names who bring throwback block-party MC energy even when their subject matter gets heady. For the first time, Washington seems interested in conveying not just big feelings like joy, struggle, and transcendence, but also something like fun—just as important, no doubt, and perhaps even more difficult to get across.Washington became jazz’s most recognizable new face in part through his conviction that jazz writ large is a pressing contemporary concern. Though he has collaborated with high-profile musicians from outside of jazz—Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly the greatest among them—his own music communicates a populist spirit not through concessions to mainstream styles, but grand scale and sheer musical urgency. With their large ensembles, thunderous climaxes, and marathon runtimes, his records present jazz as vitally important, worth paying attention to even if you’re not a connoisseur.This heavy import can suffocate playful invention and human idiosyncrasy, two forces as central to jazz as the composerly ambition and spiritual yearning that characterize much of Washington’s work. In theory, the relative lightness of Fearless Movement is a natural and welcome next step after his pair of zeitgeist-grabbing epics. But too often, tunes that might prance, flex, and delight remain burdened by their own gravity. Fearless Movement’s first half is filled with guest vocalists delivering songs that attempt awkwardly to be soundtracks for both revelry and deep contemplation. The album gets better when it dispenses with its noncommittal relationship to party music, freeing Washington to pursue the heroic high drama that’s still his strong suit.The players, all excellent musicians, are drawn largely from the same crew of friends that powered Washington’s earlier work. Their default mode is full-tilt shredding, which can be thrilling and stultifying. Accompanists tend to nip at the heels of soloists rather than hang back and let them cook, an approach that pushes both sides to greater excitement when it’s working well: When Brandon Coleman’s organ dogs Dontae Winslow’s trumpet on “The Garden Path,” Winslow bobs and weaves as if to evade its pursuit, and Coleman responds by digging in even more ferociously. But when they’re all going so hard all the time, it leaves little room for the surprise of an individual outburst or the sensuality of negative space. There are two drummers playing full kits, and several additional percussionists; when one starts to settle into a pocket that might get bodies moving, the other tends to take it as a cue to start up with busy fills.",Jazz,6.9
277,"The jazz saxophonist and bassist’s latest collaboration turns songs by the likes of Joni Mitchell, Judee Sill, and Sheryl Crow into freewheeling, ethereal explorations. About a quarter of the way into “Sweet Fire,” Sam Gendel interrupts himself with a raspy, scraping yelp. Moments before, he’d been skronking away on his C-melody saxophone, lobbing a torrent of notes into the spaces around Sam Wilkes’ bouncing bassline. Suddenly, his voice erupts, as though he’s been stung by a hornet or grabbed hold of a searing hot pan. It’s not a howl of pain, but a fleeting exorcism, the power of the jam compelling him to release the spirit. In true call-and-response jazz tradition, he puts the sax back to his lips and conjures a couple of equally coarse honks from the instrument before resuming his dexterous cascade.That flash of primal joy succinctly conveys the feeling of discovery permeating The Doober, the third album in the Los Angeles experimental jazz duo’s Music for Saxofone and Bass Guitar series. As on their first two records, the pair culled these songs from live performances, editing out the audience but keeping the crackling energy intact. Studios allow artists to shape, overdub, and edit their way into an idea, but playing live is inherently raw; feeling the vibe of a room, communicating without speaking, and leaving space for chance are more immediate paths to transcendence. The Doober is another document of these musicians’ innate chemistry and trust, finding magic in the journey with no real destination in mind.Many of these songs are covers—or at least they start that way. There’s nothing especially faithful about these versions; Gendel and Wilkes are more interested in spacious textural exploration. On “Rugged Road,” they extract the chorus melody from Judee Sill’s yearning psych-folk classic “There’s a Rugged Road” and turn it into a wriggling, cartoonish mass. As the intensity builds, Gendel and Wilkes somersault over each other, layers of sax and bass swirling into a Tasmanian Devil cloud before collapsing, grinning and exhausted. In their hands, Joni Mitchell’s “The Circle Game” becomes a modal study, shifting around itself like a deconstructed Rubik’s Cube. As the minimal drum machine pattern gets more motorik, Wilkes locks his Fender P-Bass into a repetitive groove while Gendel builds a tower of looped drones. Each track on The Doober is a framed photo of outer space, presenting the infinite in a digestible container.They’re not innovators of form here—jazz musicians have long treated entries in the canonical songbook as blueprints rather than maps. Gendel and Wilkes do it with a cheeky sense of abandon. Their choice of interpolations is sometimes absurd—who knew there was such an aching, rain-streaked jazz number at the heart of Sheryl Crow’s “Tomorrow Never Dies,” the opening theme for perhaps the worst James Bond movie? In the final minute and a half of “Ben Hur,” one of the album’s finest moments, the duo’s cover of Miklós Rózsa’s “Ben Hur” melts deliciously into Chris Isaak’s “Wicked Game,” Gendel’s sax pooling around a bizarre clip-clop percussion loop. There’s a palpable glee to the album, an almost mischievous acknowledgment that any piece of music can become an invitation to greater freedom.",Jazz,7.6
278,"Nine Inch Nails’ veteran film composers provide a techno-driven score to Luca Guadagnino’s love-triangle tennis dramedy, and Boys Noize remixes it into a sleek, pumping megamix. At a recent premiere of Challengers, journalists stopped Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross on the red carpet to ask them about the score, their latest in a stellar run that began in 2010 with The Social Network, and which has bagged them two Academy Awards so far. “We’re used to the world of being in a band where we can control everything and we’re the bosses,” Reznor said. “Working in film, it’s interesting and it’s fun because we’re not the boss, we’re working in collaboration and in partnership with the director.”Reznor said this coyly, as if the theme of control—having it, wanting it, giving it up—hasn’t been central to his art for decades. Before Ross came on board, Nine Inch Nails was Reznor’s solo act dressed up as a band. He was notoriously detail-oriented, insisting on total creative oversight of things the label would usually handle, like artwork and music videos. Dominance and servitude have been a recurring theme in Nine Inch Nails’ lyrics since “Head Like a Hole,” the first track of their first album.That one was written when Reznor was broke, in his early twenties, and working as a janitor in a recording studio so he could make his own demos after hours. Some 30 years later, things are different. Reznor is a cult hero, an industry darling, and just a Tony away from an EGOT. Somehow, the man whose most famous lyric is “I wanna fuck you like an animal” ended up scoring a film for Disney—and winning an Oscar for it. If the first act of Reznor’s career was defined by him being the boss, the second has shown him either sharing creative agency or letting others take the lead.Appropriately, Ross and Reznor’s latest score is for a film largely about control and being controlled. Challengers is directed by Luca Guadagnino, the master of slow-boil eroticism who gave us Call Me By Your Name and Bones and All (also scored by Ross and Reznor). Zendaya plays Tashi Duncan, a tennis star turned coach who spends the movie’s decade-plus storyline as a puppet master to her two suitors, besties turned rivals Art Donaldson (Mike Faist) and Patrick Zweig (Josh O’Connor). After luring them into a three-way kiss in the hotel room scene you see in the trailer, she leans back and watches with a smirk as they make out with each other, then tells them she’ll give her number to whoever wins the next day’s tournament. She dates Zweig, but it fizzles when he balks at the idea of letting her guide his career. Donaldson is a more willing subject. She becomes his coach after an injury ends her own tennis career, and they end up married with a kid and appearing together in Aston Martin ads, a tennis power couple with her at the helm. The story’s climax and central storyline revolves around a match between Zweig and Donaldson that she’s slyly choreographed, and in which she’s dangled herself as the prize—stakes that suit her only by guaranteeing a bit of really, really good tennis.",Rock,7.2
279,"The Australian hitmaker’s 10th studio album is an overproduced amalgamation of disco, hip-hop, and radio pop that even Sia’s gale-force delivery can only carry so far. Sia’s voice is a titanic instrument that swerves between sorrow and euphoria in the same octave-spanning measure. Since her 2014 breakthrough, 1000 Forms of Fear, the Australian star’s career has spanned big-ticket electropop collaborations with the likes of Diplo, Zayn, Flo Rida, and Sean Paul, as well as her own passion projects. Over the past decade, her sound fully morphed from the quietly crushing indie pop of early records to produce glossy mainstream hits, including both giddy highs and some forgettable lows. Reasonable Woman, the singer’s 10th studio album, continues the trend of inconsistency. Over manicured synth arrangements and beat drops blown up to eye-watering proportions, Sia belts out self-help anthems that stick to formulaic, dated sounds. It’s outsized feel-good music with little worth feeling good about.Reasonable Woman follows 2021’s Music, the soundtrack to the singer’s misguided directorial debut of the same name. Both a critical and commercial flop, Music might suggest that Sia has something to prove. Yet few songs on Reasonable Woman summon the concentrated adrenaline and idiosyncratic lyrics that animate her best music. (Even the tepid title makes it feel as though she’s managing expectations upfront.) The chorus that’s meant to juice up motivational opener “Little Wing” weds Sia’s grandiose vocals to basic lyrics: “My little wing/I know you can’t stop crying/But tears dry up when you’re flying,” she sings in a soaring upper register, sounding as though she’s still scoring a forgettable film. On the more memorable ballad “I Had a Heart,” co-written with Rosalía, she reaches deeper, and her unvarnished performance revels in the weathered grain of her voice. Dealing out forgiveness after a breakup, she relinquishes some of the album’s pomp and gradually finds a more moving, if still treacly, sweet spot.More often, pomp seems to be the point. Reasonable Woman is an overproduced amalgamation of disco, hip-hop, and radio pop that even Sia’s gale-force delivery can only carry so far. The wobbly dubstep drop on the anonymous single “Incredible,” featuring Sia’s LSD partner Labrinth, sounds teleported from 2014. The stomping, rafters-aiming “Gimme Love” grates as it makes the titular request 12 times in a chorus. Chaka Khan’s verses on the souped-up, Greg Kurstin-produced “Immortal Queen” are so incomprehensible they’re almost camp, combining references to The Matrix, “cavemen bringing the cave queen carvings,” and Queens Victoria and Sheba. It makes no more sense in context, ping-ponging between uninspired synth arpeggios, than it does on paper. And on the truly dire Paris Hilton duet “Fame Won’t Love You,” Sia delivers achingly sincere lyrics about the trials of celebrity beside one of Y2K’s most flavorless personalities. The guitar-tinged synth-pop feels airless. There’s no forward motion, no tension—both key to the rapturous feelings evoked by Sia’s most energetic, soaring songs.She finds a more worthy match in Kylie Minogue on the breathy, strutting “Dance Alone,” an electropop highlight that shares DNA with Minogue’s recent Tension and readily invites comparison to Robyn’s “Dancing on My Own,” still the gold standard for this particular flavor of bittersweet bliss. It’s an issue that plagues Reasonable Woman: The germ of a better idea often appears within reach. That’s true of songs like the pleasure-seeking “One Night,” where bizarre, Timbaland-esque rhythmic strings propose a more interesting angle on swaggering dance-R&B. It happens again on the closing ballad “Rock and Balloon,” with the simple, metronomic synth that winds through the background and finally dissipates into an acoustic guitar melody. Those wrinkles of strangeness—whether in production, vocals, or instrumentation—are traces of a stronger album that the incoherent Reasonable Woman quickly abandons for the next drop.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

280,"On their first studio album in almost a decade, the Detroit veterans sound as calm, cool, and horny as always. With a batch of fresh ideas in tow, they avoid retreading old territory. From the jump, Slum Village have always been centered around three things: ill beats, boastful raps, and love songs more horny and cavalier than an army of porn bots. The tuneful intricacies of producer and founding member J Dilla’s music had such a gravitational pull at the Detroit group’s peak, they often overshadowed just how erotic the music could be. On Fan-Tas-Tic Vol. 1’s “The Look of Love, Pt. 1,” pattering drums and serene guitar strums cushion rappers and co-founders Baatin and T3’s thirst (“Your fragrance got me losing consciousness/Your stance got me unbuckling my fucking pants”). T3’s verse on the 2015 cut “Love Is” gets even more direct; it opens with a bluster about being inspired to write after getting some good head. Even after several lineup changes and the deaths of Dilla in 2006 and Baatin in 2009, the SV ethos never faltered. With T3 still at the helm, the group remains committed to the groove: They continue to be occasionally thoughtful, often rock-the-mic competitive, and always willing to bet on a piece of strange.F.U.N., SV’s tenth studio album and their first since 2015’s Yes!, stays true to that bold player spirit while still being something of a pivot for the group, now a duo made up of T3 and the rapper-producer Young RJ. It started out as a more “traditional” SV album with sample-based beats, but in a press release, RJ said the pair “felt like that was boring.” Instead, RJ—who has production credits on every song—leaned toward disco and funk, incorporating live instruments and presets to create a sound that pays tribute to their past, mixing the lush exuberance of the Gap Band with the dirty swing of Synth or Soul-era Black Milk. That sounds like a moonshot on paper, but SV keeps things as loose as they always have, while bringing new voices and ideas into the fold. The group transitioned from young bachelors on the prowl to frisky, sauced uncles in silk shirts and slides at the kickback some time ago, but F.U.N. slathers a funky coat of paint onto their aesthetic.Groove is an essential part of the SV sound, and while they’ve always been versatile with gritty and soulful music, F.U.N. pops with a colorful energy that didn’t exist even back in their scrappier days. “All Live” gives their patented club-hopping a new context, with vibrant horns and luscious bass and synths flashing like tri-color flood lights. T3 and RJ are energetic, even peppy, as they drop references to Mase and Rubi Rose over the satin production. “All Live Pt. 2.” brings in harder drums and piano stabs for longtime collaborator Phat Kat to warn rappers that he’ll abort them like Roe v. Wade. This two-song suite, like the rest of the album, reframes the spit-kicking and dirty-macking sides of SV without making them look like bland revivalists or clueless trend chasers.",Rap,7.4
281,"Eleven years since their last album and nine since keyboardist Carey Lander’s death, the beloved Scottish indie-poppers return with an appealing balance of fond memories and fresh energy. The industrialization of nostalgia has grown so tedious that the comeback of an old favorite can elicit as much malaise as excitement these days. But news of Camera Obscura’s impending return stirred something hot and fluttery even in cycle-hardened indie-rock hearts. Stereogum “literally squealed,” as did I, as did probably anyone who followed the most loveable band in twee from around 2000 to 2015, a run cut short by the untimely death of keyboardist Carey Lander. How else could we express our feelings about music that, even at its saddest, had brought such unique delight—for reasons that, given its unpretentious style, were so hard to put into words?It took years to fathom someone sitting in for Lander, in which time Campbell also had a child. But reuniting in 2019 at the behest of Belle and Sebastian was a most fitting rebirth: In 2001, Stuart Murdoch had produced Camera Obscura’s debut, Biggest Bluest Hi-Fi. Indie fans were already gaga for one Glaswegian band with shy boy-girl vocals, old-fashioned pop underpinnings, and zesty, testy lyrics, and they were thrilled to get another one right from the source. Underachievers Please Try Harder, from 2003, perfected their style—plainspoken, sardonic, deliciously heartbroken; bookish rather than self-consciously literary; and marked by subtle strains of postwar Americana, which flourished on 2006’s Let’s Get Out of This Country, a clear turning point. John Henderson, who sang a lot on the first two records, left the band, and Campbell took center stage. Over two more albums, her lilting, aching songs carried the band’s relatability over into a color-drenched land of high fidelity, where it flushed with big studio strings and horns, embracing bubblegum rock, orchestral pop, beach music, and, especially, country and western from the altars of Patsy, Tammy, and Dolly.There were many reasons to be optimistic about Look to the East, Look to the West, the Scottish band’s first album in 11 years. They had gone out in top form on Desire Lines, which I slightly underrated then but grew to adore. Key creators of their ferny, silvery sound were still in place—including McKeeve, bassist Gavin Dunbar, and drummer Lee Thomson—and Lander’s former role was ably taken up by Donna Maciocia. But the emotional charge in anticipation of the new album came from the fact that their story had been left unfinished so suddenly and cruelly. This wasn’t a comeback; it was catharsis, and the only question was whether or not time had faded Tracyanne Campbell's gifts: her rumpled-classic songwriting, unerring instinct for melodic embellishment, and the long green meadows of her voice.",Rock,8.0
282,"Dua Lipa’s star power sounds muffled on her much-anticipated third album, which has many interesting ideas for songs and a surprisingly low hit rate. Dua Lipa is a pop star who stridently resists personal disclosure in her work. This added an irresistible biographical quirk to “Houdini,” the hard-edged, darting lead single of her third album. As she often does, Lipa was challenging a guy to impress her before she gave him the slip. Lipa herself is an elusive presence, which isn’t to say she’s reclusive. Although it’s been four years since her second album Future Nostalgia, the British Albanian-Kosovar 28-year-old has remained omnipresent thanks to various luxury brand campaigns and the contractually attendant magazine covers, roles in Barbie and Argylle, her podcast and book club, and the album’s pandemic-delayed tour. Despite that visibility, she appears glamorous, distant. It’s quite admirable that she refuses to trade on her private life for intrigue, especially when celebrity subtext has never been a more powerful driver of pop success. At the same time, it’s hard to decipher what she stands for as an artist, and harder than ever on the confused Radical Optimism.Lipa’s 2017 self-titled album was the sound of a young pop star coming into focus. A long-gestating grab-bag of thrusting nightclub staples seared by her white-hot burn of a voice, it finally took flight when the sisterly video for “New Rules” turned an album track into a whopping hit (and seemingly just in the nick of time to avoid being sent to guest-vocalist purgatory). It bought her the right to become an artiste on the focused Future Nostalgia, which transmuted the sounds of Lipa’s ’90s youth, the playfulness of the Spice Girls and the funkiness of Jamiroquai, into weightless disco reverie. Hers was the first major lockdown promotional campaign, and you wonder whether COVID curbed the lifespan of these lusty bops by depriving them of their natural dancefloor dominion, or in fact cultivated it, giving them a lasting power no marketing team could have dreamt of.Going by the curiously opaque, even defensive press that led into Radical Optimism, you begin to suspect the pandemic did a fair bit of the heavy lifting. Of her new album, Lipa, er, Time recently, “I’m just a different person, so of course this record is going to be different. I have different thoughts, wants, needs, and perspectives.” Go girl, give us something? She’s bristled at the entirely accurate notion that “Houdini” has anything to do with disco; elsewhere in the promotional word salad, she has spoken frequently of the inspiration of Britpop and the energy and experimentation she hears in the likes of Primal Scream and Oasis. But listening to Radical Optimism with Britpop in mind might recall the Arrested Development bit in which Michael Bluth is forced to ask, “seen”",Pop,6.6
283,"The New Brunswick musician learned collage techniques from a found reel-to-reel tape; here, he brings them to bear on a live-or-Memorex studio deconstruction of his own idiosyncratic songwriting. Jon McKiel’s life and music changed forever when he bought a haunted reel-to-reel. When the equipment arrived at his home in rural New Brunswick, the singer-songwriter discovered a tape still wound into the machine, full of odd song fragments and guitar noodlings recorded by its previous owner. Who was he? When did he make those recordings? What dreams did he have for his music? Nobody could say. McKiel and his co-producer Jay Crocker (better known as JOYFULTALK) dubbed the anonymous artist Bobby Joe Hope, welcomed him as a full collaborator, and even named the subsequent album after him. The songs on 2020’s Bobby Joe Hope sampled snippets of his unfinished songs into unusual sound collages that disrupted McKiel’s solid, if familiar, guitar rock and inspired him to work new sounds and styles into his repertoire.Hope doesn’t appear on Hex, but the ghost of his ghost lingers. McKiel and Crocker have further refined their recombinant techniques, only this time they sample McKiel himself, assembling his own studio experiments into unusual amalgams of blues, dub, soul, folk, tropicália, and more. The songs are compellingly disorienting; their melodies are as tight as the grooves are strange—hypnotic, slightly off. McKiel and Crocker continually blur the distinction between live performance and manipulated recording. “String,” which sounds like Paul Simon lost in the Bush of Ghosts, layers a crisp guitar over a slightly distorted one, their melodic lines twining together. It’s like listening to someone play along to the stereo in the next room, and in its uncanniness the moment is both unsettling and unexpectedly beautiful.Everything on Hex seems both familiar and foreign. The title track stacks a distorted and truncated guitar lick over a busy bassline and a drumbeat that sounds like it’s been borrowed from a ’90s rap sample of a ’60s jazz tune, but it’s the free-floating saxophone that tilts the song just off its axis. The jangly pomp of “Everlee” is so recognizable as a Byrds reference that you might get that right-on-the-tip-of-your-tongue frustration from trying to name the tune. Closer “Memory Screen Pt. 2” warps a breezy guitar strum until it nearly breaks, then descends into windswept collage of guitar distortion, disembodied voices, and what might be whalesong, or static off an EVP mic. Each tinkers with a different idea, deploys voice and guitar toward new ends, yet they all fit together like puzzle pieces.Otherworldly as it often sounds, Hex is primarily concerned with the fate of this world. McKiel’s cover of “Concrete Sea,” by Terry Jacks (an underrated singer-songwriter as well as an environmental activist), presents the city as an environment unfit for humans: “No one is meant to be living here in a concrete sea,” he chants. “Everyone, including me, wishes he could be set free.” McKiel resents the erasure of wonder, the mundane encroaching on everyday magic—a timely concern now that bands are proudly using AI to write songs. McKiel finds humanity in a bit of confusion, and on this oddly affecting album he comes across as a medium, closely attuned to the unknown and unknowable as he deciphers missives from another plane.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

284,"On his debut mixtape, the south London rapper floats over some great jungle and grime grooves—you just wish he’d loosen up a little. Jawnino is prone to the type of errant observations that stumble across your mind when the drugs and drinks are hitting especially hard, glitchy epiphanies spurred by Red Stripe and ketamine. His raps drape languidly over jungle and grime grooves; no matter the BPM, his bars rarely move faster than a jog, refusing to break a sweat. Across his debut mixtape 40, the south London grime rapper comes off calm, cool, and collected—you just wish he’d loosen up a little.Jawnino isn’t too straight-laced for ecstasy or situationships, but he’s no blissfully unaware club rat: hedonistic inclinations aside, his eye for detail can’t ignore the “needles on the pavement” littering a drunk walk home. This gritty realism is paired with a wonky sort of transcendentalism, the kind of simple metaphysics that would lead someone to earnestly deploy a koan like, “If time exists, then it heals.” This is less annoying on record thanks to his ear for instrumentals, which ensconces Jawnino in warping breakbeats and incorporeal synths.These digital backdrops suitably accentuate the placid bounce of Jawnino’s flows, like when he murmurs, “Never went to art school/likkle in me artsy” on “Scr33nTim3” or when he scoffs, “who d’you think brought all the girls outside?” on opener “2trains.” Although his bars can be bland, 40 remains broadly compelling whether stalking through icy nights or throwing its hands up in packed-out nightclubs. Woesum-produced “40wave” buzzes like a brood of cicadas; the wubby jungle of “Lost My Brain” papers over mundane one-liners like, “I need me a leather jacket, I told Renzo I want it in brown.”Jawnino’s stoic vocals rarely betray any serious feeling, leaving emotional regulation up to the producers behind the boards. That can be a problem on slinkier tunes like “Dance2,” where Jawnino adds little to the song’s groove, or on more grandiose tracks like “Wind,” where his smoldering verses are doused by a heavy-handed chorus. Or take the rushing strings of album peak “Westfield.” Jawnino sounds pretty good until fellow Gen Z grime MC Kibo comes barrelling in: “The game is bossman’s fridge/The coldest ones will stay at the back.” Being shown up by your guests can be a mark of respect, but as with the MIKE feature “Short Stories,” Jawnino’s inability to stand tall beside his peers only emphasizes the room he has to grow as a lyricist.A trio of remixes at the record’s close help to tease out latent emotional threads by treating Jawnino as just another musical element to be pitch-shifted and skewed. Evilgiane preserves the squeaky nightcore hook of 2022’s “3styl3” but swaps the spare shuffle of the original for wrecking ball 808s; Airhead ditches the woozy melodies of “Can’t Be” in favor of eerily pinging synthesizers. “sentfromheaven” ranks among 40’s better solo outings thanks to Jawnino sedately detailing a faded tryst, but a remix by Night Slugs co-founder Bok Bok pushes the track into far headier terrain; the effect is akin to seeing the same painting with and without glasses.",Rap,7.0
285,"Jessica Pratt’s fourth album of hypnagogic folk music hones her mysterious song to its finest point. There is already so much to admire about Jessica Pratt the folk artist: her elliptical lyrics, her nylon-string guitar and voice to match. But the label of folk singer-songwriter doesn’t quite capture the real essence of the Jessica Pratt song. It is difficult to describe, like a dream that doesn’t go anywhere but still feels like you should talk about it in therapy. In the bottom right-hand corner of the lyric sheet that accompanies the physical release of her fourth album, Here in the Pitch, Pratt includes a quote from Leonard Cohen, pulled from a 1975 Crawdaddy interview about the genesis of songwriting and trusting your own process: “The fact is that you feel like singing, and this is the song that you know.”The great joy of Here in the Pitch is getting familiar with this mysterious song that Pratt knows so well. There are nine of them here that amount to less than half an hour of music—notable not only in an era of gluttonous releases but also because it’s the same track count and runtime as her last record, Quiet Signs, which she put out five years ago. Now, for the first time on her albums, there’s some light drumming and synth playing, a few basslines and distant bongos. Yet none of this makes the music sound bigger. It’s as if we’re zooming out while dollying in, a hypnotic shift in perspective that makes the music sound more intimate in a larger space. It is a prime example of hypnagogic folk that quietly explores the simultaneity of time in all its misery, wonder, and promise.Which is to say, it also has a lot of reverb. What did she use as a reverb chamber, an Olympic natatorium? No, but as on Quiet Signs, Pratt continues to put the studio to work for her the way famed pop innovators like Brian Wilson or Phil Spector did by letting her voice sound like it could fill a cathedral in these tiny little songs. If her first couple of homespun records were her Pink Moon, this one has more the feel of Bryter Later, the warm sound of psych-folk melancholy sparsely appointed and loosely fleshed out. Sprinkle in the Brazilian rhythms of ’70s MPB albums and the pinpoint vocal precision of someone like Judee Sill or even a jazz singer like Anita O’Day, and you’re starting to map the old soul and hazy recombinant soundworld of Here in the Pitch. Something in its chemistry will turn any speaker into a vent that leaks the album into the room until it is invisible and all-consuming.",Folk,8.8
286,"Last year, Neil Young and Crazy Horse played a VIP private party for one of Canada’s richest men. Now you’re invited to hear their cantankerous takes on almost every song from 1990’s Ragged Glory. The significance of the Rivoli to Toronto music lore cannot be overstated. Upon opening in 1982, the Queen Street West venue became an epicenter of local bohemia, with a streetfront restaurant serving up pad thai to art students on first dates, a second-floor pool hall where you could wager away the last of your beer money, and most crucially, an intimate, 200-capacity brick-walled performance room where the city’s freaks had free rein. Through the ’80s, it was the space where queercore pioneers Fifth Column turned their gigs into Super 8 film happenings, the Cowboy Junkies perfected their brand of codeined country, and a pre-TV Kids in the Hall pushed sketch comedy to anarchic extremes. In the late ’90s, it was the place where a young Leslie Feist workshopped songs and tended bar. And a decade after that, you might’ve caught a teenage Aubrey Graham trying his hand at improv. Even now, long after the Queen West neighborhood’s cachet has diminished, the Rivoli is still a place where music history is made: Last November, it hosted arguably the strangest Neil Young and Crazy Horse gig ever.There’s nothing that shocking about an artist of Neil Young’s stature playing a room as tiny as the Riv—the surprise small-venue underplay is a fairly common move for arena-level acts promoting a new album or warming up for a big tour. But the circumstances surrounding the Rivoli show—a private 50th-birthday party for billionaire Canada Goose parka poobah Dani Reiss—raised a few eyebrows, given that Neil’s spent a good chunk of his career putting corporations in his crosshairs. (Maybe, after spending his formative years in Winnipeg, Neil just really appreciates a warm winter coat.) What’s even more unfathomable is that Neil Young and Crazy Horse were actually the opening act—in keeping with the party’s theme of “age before beauty,” their set was followed by an appearance from Canadian rock-radio mainstays the Arkells. But the live-album document of the gig, titled Fu##in’ Up, is more than just a glorified souvenir from the sort of birthday party that presumably required its guests to sign NDAs.At the Rivoli, Neil and the Horse performed a track-by-track (minus one) run-through of 1990’s Ragged Glory, and in a nod to the gig’s secretive logistics, all of the songs—save for the cover of the ’60s garage-band standard “Farmer John”—have been rebranded for Fu##in’ Up with new titles pulled from their respective lyrics. If 1989’s course-correcting Freedom offered an encouraging sign that Neil hadn’t completely lost the plot during his infamous ’80s wilderness years, Ragged Glory affirmed his elder-statesman status for a new generation of flannel-clad feedback addicts, prompting tours with Sonic Youth and a million “godfather of grunge” plaudits. The album topped the Village Voice’s Pazz & Jop critics’ poll and was widely hailed as an electrifying display of vitality from a veteran band entering their third decade together—and that was 34 years ago. Now that Neil and his bandmates are pushing 80 (if not already there) Ragged Glory’s spirit of camaraderie, perseverance, and bittersweet nostalgia feels all the more trenchant. If a line like “There’s very few of us left, my friend, from the days that used to be” carried a whiff of melancholy in 1991, imagine what it feels like to sing it now.",Rock,7.6
287,"The UK singer-songwriter and producer’s vision of pop is spare yet sumptuous. His new album features Panda Bear and Carly Rae Jepsen, but the real draw is the mellow, déjà vu quality of the music. The backstory of a Bullion song is never obvious. All that’s legible are stray details—a name, a place, an age—silhouetted in the warm light of emotional afterglow. In “Hula,” my favorite song from 2020’s We Had a Good Time, he hinted at stolen moments on dancefloors in Tokyo, Mexico, and Berlin (no further context; guess you had to be there) and asked, out of nowhere, “Are people in pain where you are?” That a bittersweet synth-pop track so perfectly suited for swaying cheek to cheek coincided with the onset of the novel coronavirus made the question feel uncannily apropos.The British singer, songwriter, and producer born Nathan Jenkins similarly blends the vague with the vivid on “Your Father,” one of the standouts on his new album, Affection. Over characteristically subtle production—a fistful of agates for a synth line; flashing shoals of guitar and sax—he sketches out the blurriest fragments of a private memory, then twists the focus ring: “Your father/Listened to/The whole of/The White Album/As he waited to collect us.” No matter how many times I rewind the line, I can’t quite make sense of it. I can see it: chaperone, tape deck on the dashboard, an hour that Dad spent killing time while the kids got up to who knows what. But the specifics are indistinct, known only to Jenkins and the “you” of the song. Bullion’s vignettes are just that: sharp in the center, darkened around the margins of the frame.But you don’t come to Bullion’s music for the stories, really; you come for the sound, and he has never sounded more in control of his craft than on Affection. Since the late 2000s, Jenkins has been developing an idiosyncratic style that’s hard to sum up, in spite of its elegant restraint. You could call it retro-conscious electro pop with one foot in UK dance music; you could also simply call it pop, or at least the kind of pop you’d expect from someone who’s produced Carly Rae Jepsen and Nilüfer Yanya. He calls it “Pop, not slop”—also the name of a long-running playlist he maintains on Spotify.Whatever that term may lack in precision or pith, the playlist efficiently triangulates Jenkins’ musical coordinates. It’s full of sophistipop, electrified yacht rock, Japanese city pop, mellower strains of new wave, and, above all, the odd curveball from ’70s rockers who greeted the next decade by spending major-label money on top-of-the-line synths and drum machines. Bullion’s music is steeped in the liminal areas where genres blend promiscuously and digital reverb bleeds across acoustic guitars and gridded click tracks. If his tales feel like strangers’ snapshots found in a box at the flea market, his songs have an equally vintage tint, shot through with a déjà vu quality that makes them feel like you’ve heard them before, but can’t quite place where.",Electronic,8.0
288,"The debut from the young Atlanta rapper is a low-stakes cool-girl joyride that hits best when it’s laid back. If you ever wanted to live a day in the life of an Atlanta cool girl just listen to an Anycia song. That’s been the appeal since last summer when the grainy snippet for “So What” lifted her from a life of partying and working odd jobs (bottle service, babysitter, hair stylist) to a life of partying and rapping. Produced by ATL underground gatekeeper Popstar Benny, the addictive “So What” features Anycia’s raspy-voiced, flirty-with-an-attitude raps over a beat that tosses Ciara’s hook on Field Mob’s hit of the same name into the pluggnb blender. The short visual added to the dreamy seductiveness, as Anycia and her clique—including fellow overnight sensation Karrahbooo—get drunk and turn up poolside; the handheld feel of a GoPro making it seem as if you just stumbled into a random Tuesday night of hers.Less than a year later, Anycia is on a Flo Milli album, coasting in a vintage muscle car with Latto, and teaming up with proven music industry hitmaker Jetsonmade for her debut album PRINCESS POP THAT. Compared to “So What,” which sounds like it was made on the fly as the video suggests, the album is more buttoned up, but the sense that you’re riding shotgun with her through all the drama and excitement of being poppin’ in Atlanta is kept intact.The more laid back, the better. Cruising over the generic yet smooth g-funk groove of “Bad Weather,” trickling in little details like “I’m in the Lamb’ tryna’ put my lashes on.” On “Nene’s Prayer,” wishing the worst on an ex (“I hope your barber push your shit back/I hope you get up out the car and then your phone crack”) over one of those breezy beats a Detroit rapper uses when they want to be a family man all of a sudden. Her relaxed, monotone recalls a wide array of hangout flows: The haze of Dom Kennedy, the easygoing stunting of Tony Shhnow, when Gucci or 50 do some sweet talking.But a delivery as low-key as Anycia’s relies so heavily on beats. They have to be a vibe, or else her same-y flow can wash over you. Jetsonmade is not the guy for that. The South Carolina native is a malleable, trusted hand, who is decent at booming, minimalist instrumentals that give big personalities the space to do their thing. That worked just fine on DaBaby’s “Suge” or Jack Harlow’s “Whats Poppin,” big hits that I would not lose any sleep if we left them in the pre-COVID days forever. But with Anycia, too much weight is on his production, and it’s too dry and derivative to handle that. (It’s worth noting that all of his beats have three or four other producers credited, but his producer tag gets the star treatment.) For example, the steel-drum bounce of “Call” just makes me want to fire up the summer anthems on Trapnificent Jetson’s mid-aughts trap revival on “Back Outside” is solid, but is blown out of the water by other recent beats in the same lane such as Baby Kia’s “Od Crashin’” or JT’s “Okay.” On paper Anycia and Cash Cobain seem like a good match because they both are masters of sexually charged, locally-minded, lifestyle rap, but it’s not dirty enough and the airy instrumental lacks the sauce.When the beat is right, Anycia is a fun rapper. “I fuck yo’ nigga to Detroit-type beats,” she jokes on “Type Beat,” over a thudding, serviceable instrumental by Jetson and his team. (Only thing worse than getting cheated on, is getting cheated on while a Teejayx6-type beat is on in the background.) She’s outshined by the punchier Karrahbooo on their bouncy back-and-forth “Splash Brothers,” but Anycia’s insults are still venomous. The album standout is “BRB,” a lush single where everything in town seems to be getting on her nerves; the girls copying her, the guys in her messages: “Blowin’ up my phone I know yo’ baby mama whack.” It’s the perfect Anycia song: Low-stakes, short enough to be a snippet, rapped as if she’s unimpressed, possibly even burdened, by her Atlanta cool girl status.",Rap,6.8
289,"Fusing ultra-vivid digital production with hazy vocals and acoustic guitars, the Irish-Chilean producer makes music inspired by sleepless nights, lethargic days, and the omnipresent internet. On March 12, 1951, Hank Ketcham debuted Dennis the Menace in the Post-Hall Syndicate, which supplied content to newspapers across America. In the UK, on the same day, David Law published a comic strip of the same name in The Beano, a children’s magazine. The odd anecdote inspired the title of Sega Bodega’s third and latest album, Dennis. For Sega, aka Salvador Navarrete, the coincidence is a precursor to what today we might call the internet hive mind. “I have this theory that all of our brains are connected to a machine that is pumping out information to all of us all at the same time,” Navarrete told Interview. His statement might bring smartphones to mind, but the Irish-Chilean producer means something more enigmatic, predating Google and social media—closer to divine fate than a viral meme.Dennis is the most recent entry in Sega Bodega’s increasingly personal body of work, framed through his singular lens of murky, club-ready pop and confessional lyrics. Where Navarrete has always balanced ballads and euphoric production, often in the same song, on Dennis the line is practically nonexistent. From the one-two punch of early standouts “Adulter8” and “Elk Skin,” Dennis puts dark pop in the service of visceral pleasure, pairing addictive, tactile synth arpeggios with muffled vocals and acoustic guitars. Inspired by Suspiria (see “Tears & Sighs,” whose title comes from two of the Three Mothers), sleepless nights, lethargic days, and the internet’s omnipresence, Dennis is an album of floor-fillers, especially in its first half, that plays out like a bad hangover, one song shifting into the next like Dante passing through the circles of Hell.Where other artists might shy from fusing acoustic and electronic sounds so closely, Navarette embraces them as equally worthy of attention, although his palette is distinctly digital in color. Much as in his contribution to Caroline Polachek’s “Sunset,” trance motifs and acoustic guitars effortlessly converge, particularly on “Elk Skin” and “Tears & Sighs.” Dennis is more playful than Navarrete’s first two albums, incorporating cryptic spoken-word “sleep talking” interludes from Miranda July and others. “Elk Skin” opens with a Greek fan asking Navarrete to sample her voice; “Dirt” concludes with July repeating, “My water bottle is bird transition”—the kind of “beautiful nonsense,” Navarrete has said, that “comes out when someone is absolutely comatose.” He seems to be using these voices more for their sonics than for the words’ literal meanings; the same applies to Navarrete’s lyrics, which take a back seat to his dazzling, sometimes unpredictable production.",Electronic,7.2
290,"The Swedish rapper’s latest is the most fully realized project of his career. Its blurry, blot-out-the-world vibe glitches between reality and nightmare. “Not many brain cells left, but I’m ready for—” Bladee begins his new album, before he’s cut off by Vincent Price’s famous laugh from “Thriller.” So fried he can’t finish a sentence, this madman’s at the brink of collapse. Seized by panic attacks, he threatens to “kill kill kill” and calls himself “a stupid bitch” while ambulance sirens wail and screams lacerate the night. Ten years in, the Swedish rapper is the most famous he’s ever been and still crippled by anguish. “The only thing that’s left is paranoia,” he cries.Trying to explain Bladee’s bizarre thrill to doubters always felt risky: the more you thought about it, the less sure you were about why you liked him. Here was this young Swede soaking in Auto-Tune and cosplaying as a listless, emo Chief Keef; half the time it was impossible to tell what his verses meant. Still, the twinges of ache in his voice, floating over glassy and gloomy beats, felt inexplicably poignant. His slipshod vocals capture the ennui of modern life like nothing else, or so one long essay put it. Over time, he’s made it easier for true believers and rubberneckers alike, stretching his voice to acrobatic wildness and sculpting a galaxy of surreal lore in the lyrics. Bladee’s version of rap is blemished but beautiful, imperfect and half-coherent in a way that makes banal thoughts feel endearingly askew.Cold Visions is his most realized project to date, an anxious 30-song album that doubles as a chance for him to reflect on his dizzying ascent. It’s enticingly darker than most of what he’s put out in recent years—the sublime optimism of Crest and 333, the summery bounce of Good Luck and The Fool—and more cohesive than Spiderr and Exeter’s freaky experiments. It’s like his life is glitching between dreams and nightmares. He’s at the Gucci store one moment then lying sleepless, begging for help the next; he’s declaring himself the bloodthirsty king then sitting at McDonald’s where all he can muster is calling it the “Sad Meal.” Bladee reaches max mania on “End of the Road Boyz,” which begins with the ear-splitting shrieks of a viral Roblox squeaker that’s like a bouncer for old heads. Flitting between moods, he unleashes a flurry of saintly warbles and baleful mumbles. “Reality surf might break my mind,” he warns. “Take another breath, it’s great, I’m fine.”Everything bursts alive here, from the surround-sound vocals to the production roster that’s basically the cloud-rage Avengers. Seamless transitions make F1LTHY and Warpstr’s synthetic blazes melt against the icy trembles of Lusi, Woesum, Yung Sherman, and Whitearmor. Bladee’s delivery is constantly morphing, hurling horrorcore grunts and evil ASMR whispers over smooth rap flows and the kind of helium-high singing he honed on Crest and The Fool. Demented ad-libs shadow pristine verses; words deform into mutant growls. “King Nothingg” is a killer coronation: Bass thuds convulse, synths shiver, Bladee jokes about trauma-dumping and murdering people for nothing. The mix shakes with demonic sound effects yet somehow ends in a dreamy cloud rap reverie. It’s a far cry from the limp Auto-Tune droning of his early days.",Rap,8.3
291,"In 2014, noise maverick Spencer Clark recorded this psychedelic tribute to the visionary biomechanical designer. Its far-out electronic sketches are rich with visceral detail and dripping with horror. “World-building” is too pat a phrase to describe what Spencer Clark does. Ever since the mulched hypnagogia of his duo the Skaters, with James Ferraro, the California native has been tearing open rifts to the kind of dimensions you usually only read about in pamphlets about lizard people, or find tucked away in the occult section of old VHS stores. Unlike the new-age music Clark’s albums sometimes invoke, his vision of utopia has more to do with Jon Hassell’s extraterrestrial landscapes than with crystals or incense. Like his old bandmate, Clark is entrenched in the psychedelia of plastic pop culture, but where Ferraro spent the ’10s diving deep into the emptiness of smartphone sterility, Clark took a more colorful path. Stitching together childhood memories of dozing off at the San Diego Zoo with half-remembered dreams of ’80s curio kitsch, Clark creates Frankenstein monsters of collagist, tropical synesthesia unlike anything else in noise music.Though Clark has always toiled away more or less in obscurity (almost willfully so, as he adopts and discards aliases at the drop of a hat—Monopoly Child Star Searchers, Fourth World Magazine, Vodka Soap, and Typhonian Highlife only begin to scratch the surface), a handful of his records have stood out. Released in 2014, Pinhead in Fantasia brought an operatic grandiosity to his smeared keyboard hallucinations and became one of his most acclaimed releases. Around the same time as Pinhead in Fantasia, Clark utilized many of that album’s textures and samples in an even more baffling endeavor: a massive, four-disc behemoth titled H.R. Giger’s Studiolo, issued under the Typhonian Highlife moniker. Inspired by a trip to the H.R. Giger Museum shortly following the Swiss artist’s death, Clark left feeling disappointed by what he saw and decided to record his own exhibit of perverse, biomechanical sound objects to match the fantastical monstrosities he pictured in his head. The resulting album represents some of the deepest, most unwieldy music of Clark’s career. Remastered and condensed here into a friendlier 2xLP set, H.R. Giger’s Studiolo Vol. 1 & Vol. 2 offers a more welcoming peek into a freewheeling visionary of the DIY era working at his most far-fetched.Clark’s palette throughout H.R. Giger’s Studiolo is rich with uncanny detail: bongo drums mapped to keyboard samplers in order to play at dizzyingly nimble speeds; pitch-shifted vocals looped and distorted until they sound like the echolalia of an amphibious alien species; dinky harpsichords dancing as if accompanying some loony royal procession. Befitting its industrial theme, however, H.R. Giger’s Studiolo drips with a dank, dungeon-dwelling horror. “Giger’s Bust of Mantegna” moves with the slithery menace of an anaconda, Clark’s clickety percussion drip-dropping all over his ballooning B-movie drones. On “Flesh Ribbons Streaming Water Spiders,” high-pitched wails materialize like imprisoned wraiths crying to be freed from their cages. It’d all seem macabre if it didn’t come across like the soundtrack to the most bugged-out haunted house you’ve ever set foot in. As tracks like “Aquatic Flush of Harpishord Vacui” swell with proggy keyboard solos and opulent timpani rolls, Clark’s mutilated world hums with energy both majestic and hilarious.",Electronic,7.6
292,"On their fourth collaborative album, rapper-producers Oh No and the Alchemist are dueling dragons—even when the beats could stand to bring a little more heat. Gangrene are here to crack brains like they were blown speakers. So says Oh No near the top of his fourth collaborative album with the Alchemist, Heads I Win, Tails You Lose. The Oh No–produced highlight “Oxnard Water Torture” slides in on a bed of drums, cymbals, and haunted-house organs, a hazy backdrop he runs into the gutter. “This ain’t your Moët, this Olde English,” he says with a Joker-like snarl, his verse all harsh dissonance and razor edges. Alchemist follows up with more nimble flows and surreal writing: He’s the android with a sniper scope, hopping out the reclining Recaro seat at pinball velocity. Back together for the first time since 2015’s You Disgust Me, this dueling-stoner-dragons approach is a perfect distillation of the mud-caked shit talk the duo inaugurated with 2009’s “Acts of Violence.” Heads I Win oozes with menace when it taps into this frequency, but nearly as often, it loses some of that grime, coming off a touch too clean for its own good.Prolific doesn’t begin to do justice to this pair’s respective catalogs—last year, they dropped nearly a dozen projects combined. As Alchemist has parlayed his indie-rap mini empire into placements on Travis Scott and Drake albums, Oh No has churned out wonky psychedelia with underground stalwarts like Elzhi and Tha God Fahim. Gangrene remains the space for them to get their hands dirty, trading sludge balls with the laidback giddiness of a true-school weed cipher. Everybody needs an outlet for low-stakes fun, and at its best, Heads I Win plays their still-developing contrasts against each other well. On “Cloud Surfing” and “Just Doing Art,” Alchemist’s fixation on surreal elegance—all Lamborghini races and smearing enemies’ blood on canvases—slots decently with Oh No’s blunt threats and metaphors (“Y’all ain’t solid, just some snakes sittin’ low-low/They will find you on the side of the wall like plate sticker logos”). They still sound like they enjoy rapping about rapping together, even when they’re worlds apart.But when I press play on a Gangrene song, I expect not just grimy beats, but grimy beats that sound tailor-made for the duo. Several tracks on Heads I Win are missing the distinct Gangrene rawness, and it’s not a welcome change. Sometimes they’re a little too silly, like the Saturday morning orchestra sample at the center of “Dinosaur Jr.” or the chintzy interpolation of the Inspector Gadget theme song on “Watch Out.” Others sound like leftovers from non-Gangrene Alchemist projects: “The Gates of Hell” has the same kind of maudlin loop heard on his This Thing of Ours projects; “Just Doing Art” and closer “Muffler Lung” sound like they were pulled from the Bo Jackson and Haram folders, respectively. That isn’t to say these beats are bad, just that they don’t fit the project’s ethos. Stacked next to “Espionage” and “Magic Dust,” which do scratch that itch, they illustrate how Alc’s prodigious output is beginning to blend together.Aside from “Watch Out,” Oh No largely sidesteps this problem. In front of the mic and behind the boards, the Oxnard, California, native routinely supplies Heads I Win its filthiest moments. On opener “Congratulations, You Lose,” his slinky keyboards and farting synth line inspire him to use his enemies’ beards as Swiffer mops. Here and over the skipping drumline and sour horns of “You Should Join the Army,” he sounds vicious and hungry. Even when the beats get a bit homogenous, Alchemist and Oh No’s verbal chemistry is still airtight. Hearing them flex just for fun while playing vocal double-dutch over peppy drums on “Royal Hand” is as engrossing as early career highlights like “Gutter Water” and “Flame Throwers.” It’s one of the few times on this album when the vintage Gangrene sound feels forward-thinking, too.",Rap,6.7
293,"The Austin duo’s hushed and unassuming double album is a capstone to their career so far, a scrapbook of moments of love and loss from a life well-lived. Countless playlists and anthologies have collected the greatest songs about a first kiss and a last goodbye; mourning a parent and becoming one yourself; best friends and mortal enemies. As for the cultivation of these relationships, there’s a 256-page book trying to reteach people how to hang out, but pop music isn’t going to be much help. Hovvdy isn’t going to tell you how to navigate these things either. On one song, they’re letting loved ones know that their time together mattered, and on the next they’re setting boundaries. They might reach out to a friend in quiet agony or chastise themselves for not doing so earlier. They’re figuring it all out as it comes, just like the rest of us, and the endlessly generous Hovvdy doesn’t attempt to be a manual for living, but a scrapbook of moments of love and loss from a life well-lived.A band’s self-titled fifth album can either announce a complete rebrand or a reassertion of identity. Hovvdy is something in between, the culmination of co-songwriter/vocalists Charlie Martin and Will Taylor's decade-long process of refining and broadening their sound. 2016’s Taster introduced the duo as “pillowcore,” which, like all genre coinage, was silly and also quite descriptive. Taster accurately predicted a future where slowcore, Buzz Bin blockbusters, rootsy bedroom-pop and station-wagon country became the primary colors of indie rock—they’ve since earned the respect of heavy-hitters like Zach Bryan and boygenius. Hovvdy’s music was charming, not crucial, nostalgic without evoking any specific era or age of their own, content to offer a shoulder if someone else wanted to spill their guts.Despite its relatively supersized specs—19 songs, nominally a double-album—Hovvdy doesn’t see itself as an epic. It doesn’t sprawl; it stretches its legs, kicks its feet up. The boldest experiments all ended up as singles; “Forever” is contented adult commitment in sentiment, MTV Spring Break in sound as Martin experiments with a half-rapped cadence over Dust Brothers record scratches. In a good pair of headphones, the riff of “Jean” imagines “Jessica” getting a microhouse cuts-and-clicks treatment. The giddy and gooey “Every Exchange” is part “Butterfly Kisses,” part “Fireflies” and all heart. “Til I Let You Know” is initially a spare sketch in the middle of Hovvdy until it gets reprised as the album’s climax on “Bad News,” recalling any number of bloghouse bangers that gave someone their third wind in the late aughts.Hovvdy has released albums called True Love and Billboard for My Feelings, but they never quite embodied those concepts as wholly as they do on “Meant,” which recasts their cover of Coldplay’s “Warning Sign” as proof of concept for their own Klieg-lit power ballad. A singles-only version of Hovvdy would still be seven tracks and a sci-fi lark where the band time travels across the last 25 years of recombinant alt-rock. Within the greater fabric of Hovvdy, they are joyous peaks, proof of how songs mocked in a more self-conscious time can be rehabbed and heard anew through a cunning needle drop, a class reunion, or just through the ears of a kid.",Rock,8.3
294,"Returning home to Humboldt after 20 years of roaming, Ben Chasny finds new connections between the modes—fingerpicked guitar, hushed folk, experimental noise—that have long crisscrossed his work. As with all Greek myths, there are several contradictory versions of the story of Hephaestus, but in each one, he was exiled from paradise and forced to toil at his craft on the Earth before he could go home, transformed into an artisan god. I’m sure Ben Chasny wasn’t making such lofty claims when he gave Hephaestus’ name to a song on his new album, but the parallels are plain.Back when Six Organs of Admittance was a few years old and still fairly divisible by Leo Kottke and the No-Neck Blues Band, Chasny left Northern California as a stern fingerstyle guitarist with penchants for Asian modes, lo-fi noise, and occult antiquity. After 20 years of roaming, he returned to Humboldt as a more tempered songwriter and a superior sound artist of capacious scope. Alone, he drew the ancient redwoods around him like a curtain and set to work on Time Is Glass. Rather than adding new experiments to those spread across his dozens of releases, he resumed them, using all the powers he’d banked, from the special vantage of where it all began.“Hephaestus” is just the latest time that Chasny has set an instrumental on Greek marble—he memorably put Actaeon, who was turned into a stag and eaten by his dogs for glimpsing Artemis bathing, in the first song on Luminous Night—and it’s probably the best. On Time Is Glass, the song is a dramatic outlier: a musky, supple, soul-shivering drone piece that credibly evokes sparks peeling from a divinely immense anvil. But this is what passes for a back-to-basics Americana record in Chasny’s expandable world, and most of the songs sink deep acoustic roots before growing in gratifying ways, whether subtle or surprising.The bookends, “The Mission” and “New Year’s Song,” lay out his songwriting materials in their sparest pieces—the room tone chirring like cicadas, your ear right up against the hole in the guitar, and a thin, sweet, slightly aloof voice floating down from somewhere above. Replicating them four or five more times with some atmospheric interludes would have made for a fine record. But Chasny has never been content with fine, and with his unusual blend of restlessness and focus, he keeps breaking new connecting paths between leafy, well-worn ways.This exploration unfolds with intense patience, each song striking out a little further. An electric guitar glints like light through the clouds in “Slip Away” before “Theophany Song” reminds us exactly why Chasny was once so associated with Devendra Banhart, and then the forge heats up for a spectacular second half. “My Familiar” is a haunting dirge until an electric guitar appears, the muted riffs and sailing leads structured tightly as a proof. It continues the uncanny chimera of Steve Stevens and Bill Frisell solos that Chasny concocted on his last album, The Veiled Sea. “Summer’s Last Rays” seems like a pure technical showcase of fanning runs, leaps, and trills until an invasive species of reversed, gurgling effects starts tugging at the relentless figures, refuting their rigid account of linear time. The two and a half minutes of wistful acoustic sprays that open “Spinning in a River” set up a drop so good, so unguessable yet fitting, that I genuinely don’t want to spoil it.",Experimental,7.7
295,"The Brooklyn artist’s debut is 20 minutes of chaotic, passionate, electronic rage music. Think Lil’ Kim and rhinestones, Death Grips and latex doggy gear. LustSickPuppy—who makes a madcap meld of punk, digital hardcore, rave, and rap—typically exerts a hyper-confident lusty indignation. It’s not that Tommy Hayes, the mind behind LustSickPuppy (LSP to the heads), doesn’t ever mention romance or melancholy within the turbulence of their mostly self-produced discography, which now totals 27 songs and a tad over 45 minutes, all counted. But all over their debut album CAROUSEL FROM HELL is the image of peeling back: “Peel ya skin back/Peel back all of my layers.” We get one surprising moment of tenderness with an almost sweetly sung “I love you, I love you/I want you to stay,” but as we move along, this peeling works in reverse, the tenderness revealed to be anger, as though to say the deepest of feeling is passionate rage.This is the kind of music you get with or you don’t. It’s hard, it’s fast, it’s ambitious, loud, a maelstrom of genres and references only someone who grew up in Crown Heights going to punk shows and traipsing on the weirder corners of the ’00s internet would want to make. In response to my attempt to explain exactly what LSP does, a friend said “I can’t keep up with the kids.” But in certain circles of a DIY scene that centers harsh noise and breakbeats—such as those familiar with what was once called The Mutants and included Deli Girls, Dreamcrusher, and Kill Alters—LustSickPuppy is royalty. Fans will have lyrics memorized within days of a drop; they’ll bark when ordered to bark.At barely 20 minutes, CAROUSEL is the longest LSP release to date—which I suppose is what makes it an album and not an EP, like 2020’s COSMIC BROWNIE or 2022’s AS HARD AS YOU CAN. It’s COSMIC BROWNIE’s “Graveyard Smash” and AS HARD AS YOU CAN’s “Ego Bruiser” that are key to this world—a world Hayes told Office Mag was built with and for “weird little creatures who like to dance until they die.” The former is a flip on “Monster Mash,” crawling with “Ghouls and goblins, creatures mobbing.” The latter is a sex romp (“This pussy I keep it sticky”) whose zany video features Hayes as a blonde-wigged bodybuilder. There’s always humor. This must be emphasized. CAROUSEL’s final song “Chokehold” rhymes “Tamagotchi” with “Hitachi” and throughout are tongue-in-cheek quips and self-references, giggles and lols.The LSP universe includes but is not limited to: Lil’ Kim and neon clown makeup, Foxy Brown and rhinestones, Bring Me the Horizon and silver spiderweb bras, Death Grips and latex doggy gear. They once, for Halloween, had a prosthetic hand giving the finger made as a mask. Hayes tweets such things as, “I hate being referred to as mother plz instead refer to me as overlord,” and suggests one listen to CAROUSEL plugged into Doc Brown’s enormous amp from the beginning of Back to the Future. A porn site ad-esque gif promo-ing “CHOKEHOLD”: “Are u a Sick Puppy?? LustSickPuppy wants to put YOU in a chokehold. You won’t last 2:07!!!” CAROUSEL is missing the goofy found sounds and allusions and some of the playfulness I so loved about their previous output, but it doesn’t lack for moxie.",Rap,7.2
296,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit Lou Reed’s 1982 solo album, a strangely alluring comeback that made good on the promise of a lasting rock’n’roll icon. The three-minute guitar duet that kicks off 1974’s Rock ’n’ Roll Animal is kind of satanic when you know what’s coming: “Sweet Jane,” one of the most beautiful and important songs of all time, written by Lou Reed for the Velvet Underground, a beautiful and important band that felt like the last piece of the puzzle to teenage rock fans who discovered them during their renaissance in the early nineties. “Sweet Jane” is the song that liberated a generation from classic rock radio. It proved that you could write something durable without resorting to the exhausting riff-mongering of Foreigner or the idiot machismo of AC/DC. To hear this landmark of art rock used as a prog noodle pot by Reed’s touring band is a profoundly disorienting experience, but the whole album is like that. They do “Heroin” as the kind of uptempo funk that would later be used to get guests on and off of late-night TV. It all sounds very not Lou Reed, but by 1973 the question of what Lou Reed was had become unsettled.Fans who encountered Reed’s body of work in retrospect may be surprised to learn that Rock ’n’ Roll Animal was his first gold album. I urge you to listen to it—if only to understand what might have happened if he had been born an Allman Brother—at some point before you put on The Blue Mask, an album Reed would release almost a decade later, in 1982, after a series of semi-public crises including but not limited to: moving in with his parents, brakes-off methamphetamine abuse, the slow and occasionally violent end of his relationship with Rachel Humphreys, and asking David Bowie to produce his record seconds before drunkenly assaulting him.This period of personal disintegration coincided with a six-album run of legendarily confusing studio albums. My favorite is probably Street Hassle, which peaked at No. 89 on the Billboard charts. It contains the masterpiece title track but also the charitably-interpretable-as-satire “I Wanna Be Black,” a song that rhymes “have natural rhythm” with “shoot twenty feet of jism.” All Reed’s post-Rock ’n’ Roll Animal albums feel this way: for every good song, there are three that make you think he wrote the good one by accident, or that he is somehow mad at you for continuing to like him. The peak of this seeming hostility was Metal Machine Music, which Chuck Klosterman cited to illustrate his concept of the “advanced irritant,” an artist who has produced works of genius and then backslides to music that is simply bad. Still, I would rather listen to Metal Machine Music than Growing Up in Public, whose lyrics are disfigured by therapy-speak and whose instrumental arrangements sound alarmingly like Billy Joel.",Rock,9.2
297,"On his first album of new material in six years, Sam Beam mines the onset of middle age for sharp-eyed songs that are lively and relatively breezy, despite the melancholy subject matter. How do you measure the time between albums? The calendar says that Iron & Wine’s latest studio effort, Light Verses, arrives exactly six years, eight months, and one day after its previous one, 2017’s Beast Epic. Your record shelf, on the other hand, says it’s been two EPs, one Archive Series release, one collab with Calexico, one reissue of his breakthrough album, two live albums, and a documentary. Maybe it’s more useful to tally up all the mundane moments when you’ve tried to be a good partner or patient father or productive artist or engaged citizen—tasks all complicated by a global pandemic that, for Sam Beam, anyway, proved creatively crippling. These various metrics are all bouncing around his skull on Light Verse, an album very much aware of time passing. Beam’s own abacus can be startlingly gruesome: “Time likes pulling my teeth,” he sings on the wry, spry “Cutting It Close.” “I never knew how many teeth I would need.”All of those yanked molars add up to a new perspective on pretty much everything. Beam reemerges on Light Verse with a dry sense of humor and a newfound ability to laugh off certain tragedies, like death—both others’ and your own—precisely because they are inevitable. Even back on Iron & Wine’s relatively lo-fi 2002 debut, The Creek Drank the Cradle, he had a flair for dressing up bleak truths in warm melodies and reassuringly measured vocals, not only making them palatable but finding beauty in sorrow. Beam can still pull off that sleight of hand gracefully enough to make the title Light Verse sound queasily ironic, but now he’s looking backwards over 49 years. These new songs are about tracing your steps, taking stock, and raising a glass to lovers and friends who pass through your life only briefly. He spends much of the album wondering about people’s whereabouts: “I knew someone long ago, whether I wanted to or not,” he sings on the stark “Taken by Surprise.” “We never said goodbye that I remember.” That person didn’t stay long, but it was enough to provoke gratitude half a lifetime later.The new outlook of middle age animates these songs and allows Beam to tinker with tone and form. Light Verse is a lively, relatively breezy album, despite its somber subject matter. He worked with a new crew of musicians, including bassist Sebastian Steinberg and multi-instrumentalist Davíd Garza, who make sure their flourishes never distract from the pith of his songs. “Sweet Talk” has the bouncy pomp of ’60s bubblegum psych, which feels new for Beam, and “Yellow Jacket” builds so patiently that it sounds epic despite clocking in at a mere three and a half minutes.",Folk,7.7
298,"The French electronic titans’ fourth album is sleekly aerodynamic, expensively appointed, and stacked with bold-name guests like Tame Impala and Thundercat. If only there were some real drama. For a brief spell on Hyperdrama, Justice’s fourth studio album, it’s 1991 all over again and the rave gods are raining down lightning bolts from on high. Justice have always been time travelers, and on “Generator,” the album’s second track, they zap us back to the past with a serrated synth that tears across the stereo field like the Jaws of Life ripping through a crumpled Delorean. The sound is a reference to Joey Beltram’s oft-sampled “Mentasm,” a cornerstone of early-’90s hardcore techno and everything loud and rude—jungle, gabber, breakcore, and, however tenuously, Ed Banger itself—that followed. It might be the heaviest thing the French duo has ever set to tape; given their history (hard-rock riffs, Marshall stacks, a song called “Heavy Metal”), that’s saying something. But that very heaviness also makes the song an outlier on the album, because Justice have never sounded more polished.Magpies in leather jackets, with cigarettes forever dangling from their lips, Justice used to make a point of being provocative. Their records were awash in jagged sawtooths, clashing frequencies, and bit-crushed drums. They brought playground swagger to hits like “D.A.N.C.E.” and winkingly channeled stadium-rock dinosaurs on prog behemoths like “New Lands.” But on Hyperdrama, their first album in eight years, they sound professional, meticulous, and surprisingly grown up. This time, rather than the ersatz hard rock of their debut, the ostentatious prog of Audio, Video, Disco., or even the disco AOR of Woman, they channel the cocktail of dance and ’80s pop developed in the 1990s by their French touch forebears, particularly Alan Braxe, whose “Music Sounds Better With You” (made with Daft Punk’s Thomas Bangalter and the singer Benjamin Diamond, as the trio Stardust) set the gold standard for Gallic dance pop.It’s a slick sound, sleekly aerodynamic and expensively appointed, and buffed to an ultra-vivid sheen. On the opening “Neverender,” Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker floats atop a sumptuous bed of pulsing keys; the claps and cymbals are so crystalline that they might be jewels in a vitrine. The choral pads, car-chase arpeggios, and starry-eyed crescendo of “Dear Alan”—surely a tribute to Braxe himself—are as sumptuous as the wriggly disco-funk bassline is spry. Track after track is bathed in a hyperreal glow that’s a world away from the duo’s scuzz-encrusted early work. At some point, Justice apparently traded their cigarettes for vapes, and something of that transition feels palpable in the toned-down sound of Hyperdrama: the discreet tug instead of the defiant drag, the blue LED in place of the burning ember.",Electronic,6.3
299,"The rapper’s new album is a poignant meditation on embracing the present moment, showcasing his labyrinthine flows and deep reverence for the craft of hip-hop. Somewhere in Brooklyn, New Orleans, or Oakland, there’s a corner apartment with a window propped open. A slight breeze gently pushes the curtains aside to let the sunshine in, noises from the street below sneaking behind it. Thin ribbons of smoke from a smoldering cone, either weed or incense (but probably both), perfume the room while a gust of wind flutters notebook pages full of long-forgotten observations. There’s an undeniable wisdom that lives in moments like these, cultivated through the simplicity of attuning to the sights, smells, and space around you. If you tap into that energy, you might even bridge the past and present, connecting with something larger than yourself.That sense of spirituality permeates Different Type Time, Cavalier’s sumptuous and sublime new album. It’s in the record’s hushed mysticism: Characters perform honey jar spells or clutch copies of the Circle 7 Koran to their chest; some form of God is always present in the margins of songs, appearing as a Black woman, a mother, or the buds of a cannabis plant. It’s in the warm, beatific production Cavalier chooses, every gossamer string, lilting guitar, or sparkling piano loosely orbiting around crisp, unobtrusive drums. On “Pears,” he raps, “It’s vibrational, ain’t it” four times, using repetition to tune in to higher frequencies. Throughout the album, Cavalier constantly harmonizes with the cosmos to ground himself within the chaos.Cav is originally from Brooklyn, but landed in New Orleans about a decade ago. He and his frequent collaborators Quelle Chris and Iman Omari were previously bicoastal, convening to work on music in New York, Omari’s hometown of Los Angeles, or whatever West Coast enclave Quelle was living in at the moment. Cav and Omari eventually settled in NOLA, where the pair made 2015’s LemOnade EP and 2018’s Private Stock, the latter of which has become something of a minor cult classic among contemplative underground rap fans. Those records reflected the pair’s new Southern home, including Omari’s take on warm jazz and Cav’s ruminations on NOLA’s struggles with gentrification and police brutality. For Different Type Time, Cav recruits a new slate of producers, expanding his palette but retaining his previous works’ humid thrum. He’s still concerned with his surroundings but turns further inward, the record playing like conversations between different eras of himself.It’s hard to catch the depth of Cav’s writing upon first listen, as he frequently employs double entendres and clever innuendos, burying them in thickets of labyrinthine flows. It can be outright dizzying, like the brain-frying wordplay in the middle of “Doodoo Damien:” “Flex on the rest of you bitches and that ain’t gender ‘pacific’/That’s all coast, almost kings—Edward, King James, not Olmos/That’s American me, where Eric B. for President set precedence with me.” He finds the connective tissue between disparate thoughts, his verses resembling a heat map visualization of the brain’s firing synapses. Over the slow-motion calypso rhythms of “Come Proper,” Cav invokes the writer bell hooks, wishes his exes well, and stubs out a joint in an overflowing ashtray—all within the first eight bars.",Rap,8.0
300,"Annie Clark’s self-produced seventh album goes for a hard reset on the St. Vincent project. She retains her sharp edge as a songwriter while making the music sound exalting, inspiring, and thoroughly romantic. Annie Clark says that a performer’s job is to “shock and console.” For years, she was doing much more of the former than the latter. Her first four records—an impeccable run from 2007’s Marry Me through to 2014’s St. Vincent—played on a common trope of the horror genre, the idea that behind every pristine façade lies a world of ugliness, violence, and malcontent. Horror franchises, of course, tend to get stale pretty fast: Once you know the general mode and motive of a killer, they aren’t all that scary. The aesthetic of Clark’s music has stayed relatively consistent but as she’s added more elements in—synths, latex, wigs, outlandish album concepts that don’t necessarily align with the increasingly personal music contained within—it’s begun to feel less potent.All Born Screaming, Clark’s self-produced seventh album, goes for a hard reset on the St. Vincent project, not by going back to the harsh, alien textures of, say, 2011’s Strange Mercy, but by flicking the dial from “shock” to “console.” Musically, it feels like the first St. Vincent album since Marry Me presented without a unifying aesthetic: at various points, Clark incorporates Bond theme melodrama, Steely Dan-style prog, bouncy art pop and lechy industrial rock, making for what is arguably her loosest record, an exhale after years of fitting her songs into increasingly tight restraints.It’s a freedom that carries through to the album’s emotional content. Clark’s records often display warmth and vulnerability in flashes, but All Born Screaming feels thoroughly romantic and highlights bits of beauty amid Clark’s usual lexicon of chaotic, violent imagery. On the dazed dream-pop ballad “The Power’s Out,” she sings about New York as a kind of hell created by its inhabitants; far from a horror story or an indictment, it sounds like a love song.St. Vincent has occasionally let her mask of irony fall on past albums—“Candy Darling” on Daddy’s Home, “Champagne Year” on Strange Mercy, “Happy Birthday, Johnny” on Masseduction—but this feels like an album full of those songs. Even the harsh tracks are born out of empathy; the quivering, volatile “Reckless” is about spiraling out after someone you love dies; “Flea” might be kinda gross, casting love and desire as a form of infestation, but there’s something romantic about that idea, too. Over a beat that recalls the overdriven chug of Nine Inch Nails, Clark sings lyrics that walk a line between devoted and creepy: “Drip you in diamonds/Pour you in cream/You will be mine for eternity.”",Rock,7.8
301,"Rock might be anathema to house-music purists, but that won’t stop Eris Drew dropping the needle on Led Zeppelin in one of the year’s most anticipated, and most fun, DJ sets. Good news, boppers—Eris Drew finally released the second edition of Raving Disco Breaks, the pick-up-your-feet, turn-your-whole-day-around DJ mix series she debuted in 2019. The theme of the second edition is Rock the House—not exactly rock as in RAWK, but the verb sense of the word, as in “Keep it rockin’.” Once again the mix is available on SoundCloud and on cassette, though it landed on my desk more like contraband, one gigantic audio file too big for cloud storage to handle. Ah yes, I thought, now that’s the good stuff.Naturally Drew remains enamored of throwback breakbeat house, a sound she associates with her initiation into underground rave culture as a disillusioned ’90s kid looking for deeper meaning in life. As on Vol. 1, the cuts are fast, the selections will put you neck deep in obscure 12""s on Discogs, and the mixing style is more DIY party poster than endless scroll. Drew spins through speed-dealing ’90s rave tracks, old-school hip-hop samples, and an incredible, improbably perfect Led Zeppelin guitar part that lands like a caped hero. There are strobing keyboard stabs, Pong synth bass hits, a voice that insists on “just, like, rock’n’roll.” You ever heard Janis Joplin sing a feature on a dance track? You have now. Drew guarantees every sample here to be at least 20 years old, if not older. She remains jazzed on horns. You can breakdance; you can bunny hop. It is an entirely worthy successor.Drew makes body and emotion music, as captured in the name of the label she shares with partner Octo Octa, T4T LUV NRG. And though she’s not the kind of musician who writes lyrics, her love of wordplay is conspicuous. The Raving Disco Breaks mixes make improbably extensive use of language, chopping it up along with the samples into playful cut-and-paste winks. In Vol. 1, it might have been the announcer voice that seems to welcome you to “Clubhouse Disco” (that’s three genres, makes me laugh every time); here it’s snippets of well-worn rock’n’roll attitude slogans and fresh spins of all kinds of tracks that invoke the concept of “rock” in their titles, dialing up famous telephone headset user Terrence Parker’s “Gonna Rock You All Night” and classic b-boy soundtrack “To a Nation Rockin’.”Why Do New York Disco DJs Love Those Headphones That Look Like an Old-School Telephone?Drew doesn’t write lyrics but she does write an online newsletter. I’m struck by a passage in a recent edition, on the topic of dancing and drugs, where she describes the miserable local ragers she escaped for the light of the underground warehouse rave. “Most of my peers in high school would find a party at some suburban teenager’s house (unwitting parents out of town) and drink until they were blue in the face,” she wrote. “Everyone either was straight or pretended to be. Rock’n’roll and hip-hop were the only ‘real’ music at these parties. … Social norms and cliques were celebrated and reinforced rather than dismantled.” Contra the spirit of rock’n’roll, clearly, though I recognize the scene Drew describes here (perhaps a slightly younger, more sheltered teen would have turned to reading indie music blogs). The best thing about Rock the House, besides being a hell of a good time, is that those distinctions do not matter anymore, have never mattered, and in fact were fluid all along. Food for thought when you hear that little vocal clip of Joe Strummer rapping on the single most disco Clash song, “The Magnificent Seven,” as extracted and sampled by a deep-cut ’90s club track, as sampled and remixed by Eris Drew.",Electronic,7.7
302,"The UK band’s overstuffed debut melds indie-prog, rock, folk electronica, and post-punk into an expansive new sound. On This Could Be Texas, English Teacher outline a landscape burdened by prejudice, the cost-of-living crisis, mental health issues. The band’s name couldn’t be more apt—it’s here to school us in 50 minutes. They sweep up myriad literary and cultural references and dabble in several genres to dole out endlessly twisting melodies. If a synth flutters into mellow guitar rock, into wandering piano, into drums, out of drums, into layered vocals, with a squeaky guitar on top, you’ve about covered the dextrous three minutes of track one.This Could Be Texas takes a wider angle than English Teacher’s more personal 2022 EP Polyawkward and 2021 song “R&B,” which gained significant traction online (and is reimagined here). “R&B” harnesses singer Lily Fontaine’s experience as a frontwoman of color (“Despite appearances, I haven’t got the voice for R&B/Even though I’ve seen more Colour Shows than KEXPs”) in service of a larger message. Bouncing between disdain and rage, many of the debut album’s best moments adapt those small, personal pieces that defined Polyawkward and blow them up to fill out a long-player.English Teacher can’t leave a song alone: Not a track goes by without a twist or complication, whether a time-signature change, an instrumental flourish, or a sudden wall of sound. Those quirks are most effective on “Broken Biscuits,” where Fontaine’s dry tone makes things like government negligence and societal breakdown appear droll rather than devastating. But the energy starts to pick up, and she becomes more insistent. The move between meandering, Jon Brion-esque runs with spots of bright, plunking keys to sudden sped-up sections, where the vocals struggle to keep up, are propulsive: She spits out complaints, places blame, and explodes with anger at uncaring rulers.Most promising, and core to This Could Be Texas, is the band’s interest in melding indie-prog, rock, folk electronica, and post-punk into a new package. It’s something akin to Black Country, New Road’s Live at Bush Hall: an attempt at massive, epic-scale work, a post-rock entrée with the wingspan of the genre’s greats. And like Bush Hall, it’s a first step in the band’s imagination, hinting toward something more explosive to come.Take “Not Everybody Gets to Go to Space.” Evoking some Elon Musk-type figure, offhand jokes like “If everybody got to go to space/All of its bars would have a line” seem to fall flat. But as the song progresses to those who did make it to space, the music shifts from spare drums and bass to a rollicking backbeat, pulling in another voice and building into an echoey, bassline-built chasm with overlaid vocals and a persistent melody, blanketed by Fontaine’s shaky yelling. The re-recorded “R&B” is also significantly more intense. As the backing instrumentation ramps up with a stronger bassline and chunkier feel, Fontaine is more forward, too. Separating just the slightest bit from the impulse to speak-sing, she sounds more in control of the song. Like much of the album, it’s full of “I ams” and “I’m nots,” culminating in a question: “If I have stuff to write, then why don’t I just write it for me?”",Rock,7.4
303,"Channeling her field recordings and sound collages into richly melodic slowcore overlaid with Auto-Tune, the Texas musician opens up a new expressive frontier in her work. Texan experimentalist claire rousay’s foray into melancholic, folk-inflected pop might surprise fans of her tactile collages of everyday sounds like jingling keys, overheard conversation, and suggestive murmur. Those better acquainted with the full extent of her sprawling catalog of self-described “emo ambient”—which spans hyperpop, text-to-speech recordings, and an unfinished Elliott Smith cover—might simply see this as another left turn. In fact, on sentiment, rousay brings together strands from her previous work into a revealing self-portrait, channeling her experimental musical language into the kind of earnest pop she evidently loves but until now has mostly shared as one-offs, swapping her habitually atmospheric ambient pieces for shorter, more melodic, lyrically driven slowcore songs.Where a softer focus and everything perfect is already here were made up of abstract, shifting collages, sentiment has a stable core in her spare guitar playing and yearning vocals, to which she applies heavy Auto-Tune. Despite sentiment’s more conventional singer-songwriter mode, though, rousay doesn’t entirely abandon her avant-garde leanings, using found sounds and field recordings to enrich the album’s texture, depth, and storytelling. The result opens up a new expressive frontier in her work, finding original, affecting ways of exploring despair and desire.Depression figures heavily in sentiment’s lyrics. The album begins with a harrowing confession: “It’s 4 p.m. on a Monday and I cannot stop sobbing.” The line, read by Theodore Cale Schafer, comes from rousay’s phone—an analog twist on the text-to-speech experiments on it was always worth it. sentiment’s frank, conversational lyrics build on a similar nexus of dread and black humor. Heavy drinking (“Blacking out ’til I feel okay” she sings on “it could be anything”) features throughout. Self-loathing proliferates: “I hate me too,” she sings on “lover’s spit plays in the background.” The album is full of sexual longing but links romance to feelings of inadequacy: “Spending half of my whole life giving you head, just in case you need to forgive me one day,” she admits on “head.” Exploring the “infinite void” described in “4pm,” rousay finds a dense tangle of memories, confessions, and emotions.rousay’s concern across sentiment is not so much that these feelings will overwhelm her, but that they might be crushed into numbness—“an even worse reality,” as her note in “4PM” concludes. The album’s steady, lethargic pacing mirrors rousay’s dejection; “asking for it” swells dramatically before quickly petering out, as if it has lost its will.rousay explores anhedonia most affectingly through her voice, using Auto-Tune to give it a robotic quality. Inspired by Young Thug and Sparklehorse, she used the effect on last year’s single “Sigh in My Ear” as well as on Bandcamp uploads like “meg,” “a bullshit creative (dressing room demo)” and “new monkey (unfinished elliott smith cover).” The vocal effect was stark and incongruous in these one-offs, seemingly applied mainly for its striking sound. In sentiment, however, by crushing rousay’s emotive outpourings into a neutral, dehumanized monotone, the effect becomes a powerful conceptual device, exploring the way despair can give way to numbness and exhaustion.",Experimental,7.6
304,"Stretching their signature sound to its abstract extremes, the Montreal doomers construct chilly, majestic settings for classic poetry and original lyrics. Over the past decade, Montreal trio BIG|BRAVE have released albums through both Southern Lord and Thrill Jockey, a track record that speaks to their fluency in both bone-shaking doom metal and post-rock experimentation. But their first language was folk music. In the years leading up to their tremorous 2014 debut, Feral Verdure, BIG|BRAVE founders Robin Wattie and Mathieu Ball performed early gigs as an acoustic-oriented duo. Even as they transitioned to electric instrumentation and loaded up on percussive firepower to become one of the most punishing and prolific bands in the contemporary avant-metal landscape, BIG|BRAVE’s emotional core has remained largely intact—in their hands, noise is simply a megaphone to amplify the unrest embedded in their songs from day one.But while their official discography has turned both more expansive and abrasive—culminating in the throat-shredding epics of 2023’s Nature Morte— BIG|BRAVE also took a detour back to their folk-song roots with 2021’s Leaving None But Small Birds, a rustic retreat with Rhode Island metal mutants the Body that was ultimately less Earth than earthy, complete with revamps of dustbowl standards like “Black Is the Color of My True Love’s Hair” and “Once I Had a Sweetheart.” You could say that A Chaos of Flowers is another collaborative archival project that reanimates ancient texts. In this case, the key contributors are summoned from the grave.The majority of tracks on A Chaos of Flowers take their lyrics or inspiration from poets spanning countries, cultures, and eras—from American icon Emily Dickinson to British-Parisian lesbian raconteur Renne Vivien to Japanese proto-feminist Yosano Akiko to Mohawk poet E. Pauline Johnson aka Tekahionwake. (A true tortured poets’ department, as it were.) But they find their point of intersection in Wattie’s identity as a queer woman of mixed heritage living in a bilingual city. If Leaving None But Small Birds journeyed through the past to reconnect with storytelling tradition, then A Chaos of Flowers is more about recontextualizing old wisdom as premonitions of our current condition.As such, the album sounds less like a loud rock band mellowing out than a loud rock band sculpting their squall with all the craft and care of folk music. This isn’t so much doom metal as doomed metal—like 1,000-foot-high sand castles, these songs feel majestic yet ephemeral, as if they could dissolve into the ocean at any moment. In the past, the band might’ve used the sinister riff of “Not Speaking of the Ways” as the foundation for a monstrous march—and the presence of guest guitarist Tashi Dorji and saxophonist Patrick Shiroishi certainly intensifies its nauseous grandeur. But drummer Tasy Hudson lays off the kick pedal and floor tom to tap out a tentative rhythm on her cymbals, allowing the song to float instead of crush. It’s a treatment that perfectly mirrors Akiko’s source verse, a freeze-frame portrait of a love so strong, it has the power to stop time and provide momentary sanctuary.",Metal,7.8
305,"In their seemingly telepathic interplay, the London post-rock trio eschews typical song forms in favor of a kind of collective flickering; their music tracks the process of its creation. Whatever ineffable force makes music feel both contained and alive, Still House Plants have it. Their beautifully fractured sound seems made of nerve endings, like the band’s process is on view and we’re hearing the very moment of a Still House Plants song taking shape. The London trio of vocalist Jess Hickie-Kallenbach, guitarist Finlay Clark, and drummer David Kennedy, who met about a decade ago at the Glasgow School of Art, once said they practice only the starts and endings of their songs, which underscores how each one works: as a vessel for abandon.Is it telepathy that guides them? When Still House Plants made their U.S. debut in New York last spring, they often communicated among themselves with just their eyes. Elongated silences held between notes would put the audience on edge before everything crashed together at exquisitely incongruous angles. On stage as on record, the trio inhabits the free space of punk and the capaciousness of free improvisation at their own frequency.Like 2020’s Fast Edit, which established Still House Plants as one of the most exciting experimental rock bands around, If I don’t make it, I love u still eschews conventional song forms in favor of a kind of collective flickering, with rhythms that speed and slow by their own logic and carry the persistent charge of small epiphanies. But this is a bolder, clearer, preternaturally vivid iteration of their music; “I’ve been trying to get much stronger,” Hickie-Kallenbach sings on “MORE BOY,” a thesis. Kennedy brings the inquisitiveness of a free-jazz drummer while Clark uses their guitar to synthesize the glimmer of Midwest emo and ’90s slowcore with the choppy minimalism of no wave. Hickie-Kallenbach’s deep, soulful singing suggests Tirzah’s R&B rasp if it were more elastic and ecstatic. The band applies the tropes of electronic music (samples, breaks, loops) in the way they construct, or more accurately deconstruct, songs with only guitar, voice, and drums. A Still House Plants song is a three-way search forward. It’s always a high-wire act.The album is divided into 11 tracks, but it feels anchored more discernibly by specific moments within songs: notes and tones that make you think, What’s that? The answer might be some unknown glitter in the guitar, or some marvelous friction, like the sparks that punctuate “M M M” or the buzzsaw discord that cuts through “Silver grit passes thru my teeth” like a flash of shoegaze. The melted chords of “Pant” and wobbly edges of “3scr3w3” make me think fleetingly of Autechre (and it’s hard to imagine another band that could simultaneously conjure Autechre and American Football while speaking their own language entirely). On “MORE BOY,” when the drums pick up midway and Hickie-Kallenbach’s singing locks in, ascending over Clark’s chiming guitar, it’s chilling. The singer’s guttural vocals glitch, digging into a repeated phrase, as if she were sampling herself using only her voice. “MORE BOY” also proves Kennedy’s assertion in an interview with The Wire that withholding drum fills “helps in building up a continuous phrase that never finishes,” a liminal sound.",Rock,8.5
306,"Retreating from the experimentation of Gigaton, Pearl Jam delivers a comforting blend of agitated fist-pumpers, roiling ballads, and yearning mid-tempo anthems. When a veteran artist turns to a young-gun producer for a shot of contemporary savvy, it usually signals a desire to revamp their sound or embrace a new era. Sometimes it works: Jack White brought some bluesy grit to Loretta Lynn’s Van Lear Rose; St. Vincent nudged Sleater-Kinney in a sleeker, icier direction. And sometimes it doesn’t; remember when Danger Mouse tried to steer RHCP into an album of lush space-funk? But generally, at least, a spirit of reinvention animates the proceedings.Pearl Jam, though, seem to have hired Andrew Watt to help them sound more like… Pearl Jam. The 33-year-old producer, who was born a few months before Ten was recorded, made a name working with Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber but has since become a sought-after studio whisperer for rock elders, slickening up recent Rolling Stones and Iggy Pop albums without embarrassing his heroes. He even produced Eddie Vedder’s last solo album. With Pearl Jam, Watt seems to have served more like an accountability manager. “He really kicked our asses, got us focused and playing, song after song,” guitarist Mike McCready told an interviewer, emphasizing the album’s heaviness; Vedder told fans he believes “this is our best work.”Alluring testimonials, but the reality is less dramatic. Dark Matter plays like another solid late-era Pearl Jam record, reliable but not revelatory, with the requisite well-honed mix of generic fist-pumpers, roiling ballads, and mid-tempo gems where Vedder gets a chance to howl and yearn and babble in the upper registers as only Vedder can. As ever, he evokes a potent balance of pain and perseverance, but the album is marred by boilerplate rockers that try to confront fascist dread with platitudes and banal expressions of resistance.The title track, in particular, makes for an uninspiring lead single. A grinding, metallic rocker that’s sophomoric in its simplicity, it feels indistinguishable from the band’s legions of corporate-rock imitators. Vedder’s railing against right-wingers and press suppression seems well-intentioned: “No tolerance for intolerance or/No patience left for impatience no more” is a nice sentiment, but doesn’t exactly hit with the same provocative thrill as “I’ll never suck Satan’s dick!”The punk quickie “Running,” a fast blur of sewage metaphors and Guitar Center-core power chords, isn’t much better, while “React, Respond” thrashes and shakes like a Vs. outtake with the eccentricity sucked out. Again, Vedder is animated by righteous rage, but a frustrating vagueness dogs the lyrics, as though he’s speechwriting for a DNC keynote: “The light gets brighter/As it grows/The darkness it recedes,” he sings in “React, Respond.” It’s hard to imagine anyone but the most devoted heads differentiating these songs from deep cuts on, say, Backspacer. They’re “heavy,” sure, but not in the way that leaves a real impression.",Rock,6.4
307,"The Palestinian Chilean singer’s debut blends elements of Arab pop, R&B, EDM, and jazz into an energizing new sound with deep respect for tradition. This past Valentine’s Day, Elyanna opened the Chicago date of her first North American tour by performing the title track of her debut album, Woledto. Lured onstage by the mallet drumming of a tabla baladi and the spellbinding melody of an electroacoustic oud, the Palestinian Chilean singer-songwriter took the mic draped in angelic white. “And I ask myself after my absence,” she trilled in Arabic. “Heartbrokenly: Why did I go away/When your love was above the stars?”To reach the stars—and last year’s Coachella stage—Elyanna has summoned sounds that cross time, space, and dialects, simultaneously ancient and ultramodern. Raised in Nazareth, with roots in Viña del Mar, Chile, she emigrated to California when she was 15. Now, at 22, her sound carries the weight of her diasporic identity, channeling the honeyed style of Nancy Ajram or a young Dalida with the playful attitude of Shakira or Rihanna. Building on self-titled EPs from 2020 and 2022, Woledto (or I Am Born) plays with Arab pop, R&B, EDM, and jazz to express the nuances of love, loss, and longing. Where her EPs balanced SWANA-inspired elements with concessions to Western pop, perhaps hoping to acclimate Anglophone audiences, Woledto sounds liberated, prioritizing audacity over assimilation.In many ways, Woledo is part of a long oral tradition, embracing elements of Levantine folk, tribal fusion dance, and zajal (an Andalusi Arabic form of oral strophic poetry). Elyanna’s lyrics honor the influences that define her artistic lineage. “Did love strike you?/Or were you thrown with arrows?/This is just the nature of a man in love!/Come on and give me cups of it,” she sings on “Lel Ya Lel” (“Night Oh Night”), evoking the pain and romance of the ghazal poeticism of Egyptian musical icons Umm Kulthum and Abdel Halim Hafez. One minute Elyanna is riffing maqam scales; the next she’s wailing, “You’ve forgotten to remember me and erased our past,” backed by a sample of her grandfather, a zajal wedding singer.The whole album is a multigenerational effort, each friend and family member adding a layer to the collective memory. Elyanna co-wrote most tracks with her mother, Abeer; her brother Feras serves as pianist and creative director. He’s also co-credited as executive producer alongside two of Elyanna’s longtime mentors, the Lebanese Canadian R&B singer Massari and Nasri Atweh of the reggae-pop band Magic!. (It was Atweh who first encouraged Elyanna to sing in Arabic after discovering her covers of English-language pop songs.) Even her sister and stylist Tali leaves her imprint on the music, supplying the gold coins that ring out between the tabla, trumpet, and tambourines of “Ganeni” (“Make Me Crazy”).",Pop,7.7
308,"N/A Taylor Swift’s music was once much bigger than her. A born storyteller, she gathered up the emotional ephemera of her life and molded it into indelible songs about herself, but also about young women—about their sorrow, their desire, their wit and will. She was the girl next door with the platinum pen, her feelings worth hearing about not simply because they existed but because she turned them into art.Those days are gone. Swift, pumped up to mythical proportions by discursive oxygen, is bigger than her body of work—no knock against her body of work. She is her own pantheon: a tragic hero and a vindicated villain; an inadvertent antitrust crusader and a one-woman stimulus package; an alleged climate criminal and fixer; The Person of the Year of the Girl. Over the past 13 months, she’s strapped on her spangled bodysuit and performed a Herculean feat three nights a week on the highest-grossing tour of all time, earning her vaunted billion-dollar valuation. Her musical achievements are remarkable. But nobody makes a billion dollars from music alone.The Tortured Poets Department, Swift’s 11th studio album, senses that widening gap between Taylor Swift the artist and Taylor Swift the phenomenon, and wants to fill it with a firehose of material. The burden of expectation is substantial: This is Swift’s first body of new work since the end of a years-long relationship and a pair of high-profile, whirlwind romances—one of which, with the 1975’s Matty Healy, appears to have provided much of the inspiration here. Fans came to Tortured Poets seeking emotional catharsis, or at least the salacious details. Swift, it seems, wanted the comfort of familiarity. Returning to Jack Antonoff and the National’s Aaron Dessner, her primary songwriting and producing partners of the last several years, Swift picks up threads from Folk-more and Midnights without quite pulling anything loose.Tortured Poets’ extended Anthology edition runs over two hours, and even in the abridged version, its sense of sprawl creeps down to the song level, where Swift’s writing is, at best, playfully unbridled and, at worst, conspicuously wanting for an editor. The winking title track—a joke about its subjects’ self-seriousness—makes fun of the performance of creative labor, which is funny, given the show that Swift is putting on herself. She piles the metaphors on thick, throws stuff at the wall even after something has stuck, picks up the things that didn’t stick and uses them anyway.",Pop,6.6
309,"On her second official LP, the rapper experiments with electronic textures and proves she’s nowhere close to exhausting the potential of her Southern rap roots. Put bbymutha’s catalog on shuffle and get shrewd lessons on lousy lovers, tips for freaky sexcapades, and uplifting quotes for your mirror Post-its. In 2017, the video for her song “Rules” catapulted her to underground fame right from its breathless opening line: “You can’t give your pussy to a nigga who not used to getting pussy ’cause that pussy gon’ be everybody business.” Her unsparing candor resonated, earning her a cosign from Björk and a tour opening for Earl Sweatshirt. But for bbymutha, the way some of her early music was received felt at odds with what she intended. Speaking on “Rules” in a recent interview, she decried it as a “bad memory,” reflecting, as have other artists before her, on the paradox of Black pain being received as party music: “People really want you to turn up to your trauma with them.”On her latest album, sleep paralysis, she insists on setting the terms of the turn up. Much has changed since she made “Rules.” She’s moved up from her grandma’s crumbling house in Chattanooga to her own place in Atlanta. And for the first time she’s released a record with the backing of a label, the New York-based indie outfit True Panther. sleep paralysis is a freewheeling and exuberant ride through grimy electronic music and dark, bass-heavy Southern rap—and it’s some of the most fun music she’s made to date.She wrote the album in London, in between tour stops, and half the tracks echo sounds heard on British dancefloors, from skittering drum’n’bass to spooky dancehall. The oozing bassline and driving breakbeats of “Piss!” are busy enough to stand alone as an instrumental. But rather than get swallowed by the production (co-helmed by East London rapper and singer LYAM), bbymutha slides into the pockets of the beat, using her voice more like an instrument. It’s a weird and exciting start that gets weirder with the industrial booty bass of “head x shoulders.” Over buoyant 808s coated in the kind of instrumental debris that recalls the best of M.I.A., bbymutha, who turned a slight into her stage name, continues her mission of reappropriation by puffing up her chest to say she’s “proud to be a bastard.” The standout of her UK sojourn is “Lines,” a big-beat banger that uses a cocaine metaphor (“He wanna cut me like the lines on the dresser”) to confront a lover who’s not walking the walk.But on the chaotic “Tony Hawk,” bbymutha’s own words get lost and her voice feels too much like an ornament in the production. So it’s refreshing to hear her get back to familiar territory in the album’s second half, where her lyrics shine and her growth as a rapper is clear. Mutant Academy’s resident producer Foisey channels Project Pat on “ghostface,” a menacing highlight that bleeds with passion as bbymutha rails against her opps, threatening to jump them with her kids. “final girl” plays with pacing and internal rhymes (“I watch bitches giggle, be tickled by my misfortune/I pull up and give abortions, might dabble in some extortion”) over a trap beat from the netherworld. On “Mutha Massacre” she taps into Tennessee horrorcore, painting a disturbingly vivid image of dragging a dead man by his genitalia. As fun as it is to hear her flex different styles, she hasn’t exhausted the potential of her Southern rap roots.",Rap,7.7
310,"With multiple drummers, bassists, guitarists, and one gnarly violinist, this Austin collective turns repetitive rock music into a glorious mind eraser. Forget music that makes you feel no pain. What about music that makes you feel like nothing at all, that pushes and pulverizes you until every woe, hope, and worry disappears like dust? That is the marvelous strength of Water Damage, an amorphous collective of about a dozen Austin underground heads whose high-volume indulgence in repetition is a force both obliterative and purifying. They ride the divide between noise and rock, pounding out rhythms like a power trio caught on an eternal trip to nowhere, all beneath feedback streaks and microtonal bleats. In New York in the late ’70s, the Ramones at CBGB inspired young composer and avant-impresario Rhys Chatham to repeat an electrified E above drums until the overtones turned into a fever dream, the vision fulfilled by his Guitar Trio. Nearly half a century later, Water Damage have turned that challenge into an obstacle course with In E, their third and best album and a reaffirming testament to just how ecstatic and mighty minimalism can be.In E arrives as four side-long tracks, each charging down a single alleyway without ever wavering, glancing back, or bothering to do anything more than shift in barely perceptible ways. “Nice!” someone seems to yell 15 seconds into “Reel E,” the phosphorescent violin and colossal rhythm section presumably pausing just long enough to check the levels.And then, their marathon begins, blown-out bass and brain-fried guitar unfolding like an imagined ocean. The drums fall in line like a marching band, at least two kits shaping an ironclad pocket. But the bristled violin of Mari Maurice Rubio—who records as the great more eaze—slices through the sides of the beat like she’s trying to make an escape. And that’s mostly where the piece hangs until the band breaks down and Maurice outlasts the rhythm long enough to sail into this open void. Loud, relentless, unrepentant: Lock into that tug of war, and you may forget where you are, how you are, who you are. It feels fantastic, a rare mind eraser for our increasingly plugged-in times.Water Damage unlock the same effect on “Reel EE” and “Reel EEE” with very different approaches. For the former, the rhythm section summons a rock band that’s about to count in to their greatest hit, but they simply sit there, repeating the meter and doubling the bass until it all blurs into a trance. Don’t expect it to change when the guitars finally arrive, either, their slow wave of serrated tones washing over everything like insoluble oil. It is a web of interwoven drones, with feedback, distortion, and fragmented chords cohering into sustained chaos. “Can textures alone make a riff?” Water Damage seem to ask. The Motorik march compels you to nod along whether or not you agree.",Rock,7.7
311,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit the 1994 debut by Bark Psychosis, a pioneering work of post-rock that fused guitars and electronics into soundscapes both meditative and menacing. For Bark Psychosis, making their debut album was an act of obliteration. Over the course of a few singles and EPs in the late ’80s and early ’90s, the quartet—composed of vocalist and guitarist Graham Sutton, bassist John Ling, drummer Mark Simnett, and eventually multi-instrumentalist Daniel Gish—matured from teenagers obsessed with Napalm Death and noise rock to composers of patient and oft-improvisational pop music. But as they set out to work on Hex, they began to think about the whole enterprise differently. They were ready for the band to die.“We’ve never been interested in rock,” Sutton told Melody Maker soon after the album’s release. “I’m even uncomfortable with the idea of being in a band. It seems such a juvenile thing. I’m trying to break it all up at the moment.”Traces of this philosophy were evident in the music they’d made leading up to Hex. “Scum,” a 21-minute song recorded amid the pews and moldy carpets of the London church where Simnett worked and then released as a standalone single, sounds as if their early dreamy pop music had been reduced to misty echoes. Distant vocal sections are clouded out by celestial drones and noises that flutter and flip like heart palpitations. The band moves discursively between loosely defined sections, governed seemingly by the logic of daydreams.It’s an approach that eventually led Simon Reynolds to call Bark Psychosis “post-rock.” Though the band has little in common, aesthetically or philosophically, with gooey sentimentalists like Explosions in the Sky and Sigur Rós who became popular under that umbrella, in a literal sense, the term fits. “Scum,” and, later, Hex, represented a full-on rupture with the structure and sound of rock. In place of yowling emotionality, Sutton offered sedate murmurs. For preening riffs, they substituted brittle, crystalline guitar figures. Instead of thunderous percussion, Simnett played economically and compactly, recalling the mechanical precision of the Can records and techno they were listening to at the time. Bark Psychosis learned to be meditative, mysterious, and elliptical in a way that felt almost confrontational. Each release became a provocation to meet the band on its own terms, to find whatever peace you could in its strange rhythms.With Hex, Sutton—the band’s self-described “taskmaster”—sought to push these ideas even further. The group had long nurtured an obsession with the rigid strictures of techno, and the sequencer-based process that generated such ecstatic repetition, an approach they aimed to replicate on Hex. Jettisoning the four-guys-in-a-room-jamming process that birthed “Scum,” the band worked heavily with sampling, editing, and dubbing takes. The effect is subtle, but the resulting songs do share at least a philosophical link to the electronic music that inspired them. Hex’s compositions are hallucinatory and strange; they unfurl slowly, shifting gradually over the course of a track’s delicate sprawl until the opening moments are a distant memory.",Experimental,9.0
312,"Collaborating with a host of producers from across Africa, Europe, and Asia, the Nairobi vocalist shrieks and growls his way through a harrowing fusion of metal, rap, club music, and noise. A veteran of Nairobi’s metal scene and former collaborator within the Nyege Nyege collective of experimental electronic artists, Martin Kanja speaks multiple dialects of extremity. As Lord Spikeheart, the vocalist and producer has made bristling grindcore with his now defunct experimental band Duma, along with pounding industrial, creaky noise, and many other kinds of abrasive music. The through line in all his work, which combines global strains of metal, electronic, and traditional music, is intensity. He gravitates toward arrangements that are serrated and dense, seeking catharsis in the clashing. Kanja’s debut solo album surpasses the might of his past work by several degrees while showcasing his flair for integrating disparate sounds. Listening to it feels like moshing in the Mariana Trench, being hurled by the currents through liquid darkness.The Adept is a heretic metalhead’s ode to all drums. Backed by producers and vocalists with roots in digital hardcore, noise, and rap, Kanja welds blast beats and club grooves into a nightmare engine of rhythm. He gleefully steers this hulking frigate, perhaps keen finally to be seen as a lead act. On Duma, his feral vocals mainly rode and accented the percussion, taking a backseat to bandmate Sam Karugu’s layered beats. Here, his repertoire of growls and grunts dictates the shape of the chaos, constantly pushing the songs forward or lurching them sideways.The arrangements are even thicker than the marbled sound slabs of Duma. Warped wails, ghostly chants, and shrieking ululations whip through valleys of low end. Drums smack and pound against each other like monstrous molars. River systems of snarls course through strata of distortion and static. From the opening snare strikes to the closing synths, negative space is rare. Kanja and crew pack these songs like a metal turducken.The record isn’t just an exercise in compositional gall; it is as dynamic as it is confrontational. While some songs, like the trap-infused “33rd Degree Access,” storm ferociously out the gates, others build painstakingly to their peaks. On the record’s most dancefloor-ready track, “4 AM in the Mara,” Spikeheart and co-producer DJ Die Soon let tension smolder for nearly two minutes before dropping a thick bassline. “Red Carpet Sleepwalker” swings from a haunted whorl of distorted Fatboi Sharif vocals to trance synths and later gabber drums stacked with screams, finally dissolving into drumless babble. Likewise, “Sham-ra,” one of three songs produced by mischievous BBBBBBB producer Saionji, opens with gurgling synths, a meditative backbeat, and gusts of drone that suggest a waterside temple. After whipping into a tempest of bass kicks, staccato grunts, and prickly static, it just keeps transforming: first a roaring death march, then simmering hums and chatter. The record molts more than a cicada brood.",Electronic,7.6
313,"With spruced-up production highlighting new subtleties in their sound, yet never abandoning their melodic fundamentals, the Cleveland indie rockers’ latest radiates a renewed sense of purpose. For someone who’s spent nearly half his young life as a professional musician, Dylan Baldi still has solid work-life boundaries: The free jazz, ambient instrumentals, and acoustic experiments he’s posted to Bandcamp have yet to leach into the bottle-rocket pop-punk of Cloud Nothings. But the first single off their new album, Final Summer, has finally allowed one of Baldi’s extracurricular activities to infiltrate the band’s creative process. “I’m trying to [run] a marathon in every state,” he recently boasted, and while countless time trials and deadlifts have been set to “Stay Useless” and “Psychic Trauma,” “Running Through the Campus” suggests a more focused sort of cardiovascular exercise. “It’s just a thing I do for myself,” Baldi rasps, sounding like someone in tune with the discipline of physical and mental upkeep, and the usefulness of tracking incremental progress and pragmatic goals. That’s really where Cloud Nothings find themselves on their latest album, the first since Baldi entered his thirties. It’s a satisfying series of sprints from a band committed for the long haul.Final Summer radiates a renewed sense of purpose for a band that had begun to feel like they were spinning their wheels. Up until the remotely recorded The Black Hole Understands, Cloud Nothings switched up producers on every album, lending a distinct character to records that otherwise work within a fairly narrow sound. Reuniting with Steve Albini on The Shadow I Remember drew on the goodwill generated by their most beloved album, yet it felt like a cheat code on a set of songs that lacked the frothing urgency of Attack on Memory. Just about everything leading up to Final Summer seemed to acknowledge the opportunity for a retooling, if not a total reboot: unexpected yet sensible new tourmates, new producer, new label, all signifying security in their status as a legacy band in 2024.But you’d never guess any of that from the title track. A synth twinkles for a minute, and then another one, before the vocals enter. The mesmeric, three-note riff is more like amped-up Krautrock than spiky pop-punk. If the instrumental bridge doesn’t quite approximate Baldi’s alto sax recordings, it at least sounds like MIDI horns. Jayson Gerycz eases up on his typically runaway locomotion and propels “Final Summer” forward like a bullet train. At once instantly recognizable as Cloud Nothings and having no precedent in their catalog, “Final Summer” marks the first time in years that an entirely new lane has opened up for the band.",Rock,7.5
314,"After a life-changing illness, the UK folk singer returns with a gentle, subtly experimental album that finds hard-won solace in motherhood and recovery. After giving birth to her first child, Otis, in 2021, UK songwriter Lucy Rose developed excruciating back pain. After an unpleasant encounter at the doctor’s office and months of Rose’s own research, she finally figured out that she had a rare, severe form of pregnancy-induced osteoporosis and eight fractured vertebrae. Already reeling from the depression and burnout that inspired her 2019 record, No Words Left, Rose endured months of recovery before she could again sit at the piano and write, now with Otis in her lap. Unlike the emotional intensity of No Words Left, her new music was surprisingly energetic and joyful. She would record these songs over two days with her longtime band, recruiting producer Kwes. to help her further embellish her sound. On This Ain’t the Way You Go Out, Rose expands her capabilities as a songwriter and musician while maintaining the warmth that’s made her a British folk staple for over a decade.Listen past the smooth production of her previous work and you’ll hear sneaky time signature changes and sophisticated piano voicings. On the new album’s opener “Light as Grass” and the soaring jam session “Interlude I,” Rose displays her command of the piano, an instrument she’d increasingly adopted in her music and fully embraces here. Kwes., known for working with Solange as well as UK rapper Loyle Carner, applies his background in alternative hip-hop and R&B to pack every song with psychedelic vocal delays, disintegrating keyboards, and aggressive treatment of David Dyson’s drum kit. On “Dusty Frames,” a tribute to the late Egyptian queer activist Sarah Hegazi, Kwes. doubles Rose’s piano with a warbly synth and looming synth bass; something devastating lurks beneath, even if the words don’t fully capture Hegazi’s impact.Rose’s voice is as pure and light as ever, but the most inspired part of This Ain’t the Way is how the album repositions that quiet register as silent rage. “Could You Help Me” describes Rose’s search for medical professionals who would listen instead of dismissing her concerns as “hysterical” (really!): “Could I ever really feel it for you?” she asks, unable to communicate her experiences to dismissive GPs. Rose glides lightly across the track, but a distorted violin solo crashes in to express the frustration her voice disguises. The deceptively chipper “Life’s Too Short” and the sparse “No More” each touch on the loneliness of illness, the friends whose patience eventually wears thin. On “Whatever You Want,” Rose’s willingness to be awkwardly direct (“a miracle, a disaster, all in one foul swoop”) powers the song’s central question: What do idealistic phrases like “You can be whatever you want” mean to someone struggling to move? Beneath the instrumental experimentation, there’s both grief and a sense of hope inspired by raising Otis and by Rose’s own recovery. As she sings on the title track: “I blame myself for being so weak/But this brave body is still carrying me.”After “No More” comes the biggest swing on the record, and one of Rose’s wildest songs to date. “The Racket” starts out with an oscillating chord loop, but with every chorus, the band piles on until the final minute becomes genuinely anarchic. Rose stands at the eye of the storm, sharing in plainspoken language what she’s learned: “Took it for granted/Life ain’t always what you were handed,” the chorus opines. Out of context, that might come across like the kind of unhelpful platitude Rose struggles with elsewhere on the record, but it’s clear she means every word.",Pop,7.2
315,"The English producer’s new album reflects his gift for meticulous construction, but it feels more akin to a well-curated playlist than a unified statement. Joseph Thornalley values his privacy. On the rare occasion that the London-born artist gives an interview, he keeps his cards close, only offering enough details to foster more curiosity. Thornalley, who records under the name Vegyn, doesn’t often perform live and mostly steers clear of social media, but has worked with megastars like Frank Ocean, Travis Scott, Kali Uchis, and Dean Blunt. His music doesn’t provide many intimate details either, but it does reflect his eclectic influences, ranging from dubby ambient to lush techno to toystore electro, as well as his deep love of hip-hop. Even if it isn’t explicitly personal, his music is always meticulously constructed and frequently gorgeous, the product of a songwriter’s approach to textural electronic production. Thornalley’s new album, The Road to Hell Is Paved With Good Intentions, is another ornate but shadowy collection in his discography. It sounds incredible, but ultimately doesn’t reveal much beyond his wide-ranging taste.Born of Thornalley’s itinerant lifestyle as a label head and in-demand producer, The Road to Hell took shape in various studios, hotel rooms, and apartments around the world. He was hoping to break out of his usual production methods, challenging himself to write songs on piano and guitar, instruments he hasn’t yet mastered. Many of the Vegyn trademarks are present—cannily programmed drums, sparkling synths that sit in the mix like low-lying clouds—but Thornalley tames the genre-hopping just a touch, keeping his sounds contemporary but homing in on the yearning emotional core of ’00s R&B crooners like Ne-Yo and Toni Braxton. “Last Night I Dreamt I Was Alone” and “Halo Flip” apply a loose jungle framework to the emotional balladry of the aughts, while “Stress Test” sounds like Craig David circa Born to Do It studying at Lofi Girl’s desk. These tracks are impeccably assembled, and, in most cases, quite catchy if listened to on their own outside of the album. But as a whole, The Road to Hell doesn’t quite gel, feeling more akin to a well-curated, vibey playlist than a unified statement.It’s when Thornalley really lets loose that the record excels. The Road to Hell’s trip-hop flirtations are among its strongest cuts; “Turn Me Inside,” a rainy-day combination of glowing Rhodes, stuttering percussion, and Léa Sen’s smoky vocals, is a particular highlight. “The Path Less Travelled” is a blissful blast of big beat, sunburst synthesizers echoing into the distance like cathartic shouts from a mountaintop. Thornalley takes an especially strange left turn at the album’s midpoint and drops “Makeshift Tourniquet,” a festival-ready house heater. It’s the most propulsive song on the album, building tension through shuffling drums and pads that wobble in and out of tune like heat lines off a stretch of desert highway. When the song explodes into a flurry of spacey sequences in the final minute, it marks one of The Road to Hell’s most thrilling moments, but it doesn’t signify a distinct change in direction. Like most everything on the record, it jams and then we move on.",Electronic,7.1
316,"The New York band’s debut is a dreamy, druggy pop album that finds a provocative sweet spot between being chintzy and being sincere. Chanel Beads is what you might call a scene band, the project of producer Shane Lavers who’s associated with the much-maligned lower Manhattan micro-neighborhood of Dimes Square. They play packed shows in lofts and bars full of kids born in 2004 taking pics on a point-and-shoot digital camera while wearing absolutely enormous pants. If you go to a bar called The River and hang out with dripped-out downtown people, someone will ask you: Hey, have you listened to the new Chanel Beads singles?This is essentially how I was initiated to Chanel Beads: because they suddenly became inescapable, at least in the much-maligned lower Manhattan micro-neighborhood of Dimes Square. It started with “Ef,” a one-off single from last year, which somehow sounded like the Microphones but also kind of like Enya and Gang Gang Dance? I quickly abandoned any prejudices I had about a band that I began to become convinced was a sort of Drain Gang for the art school set. “Ef” felt totally fresh, a sexy bricolage of completely zonked synths where singer-songwriter Maya McGrory’s vocals burst and bloom in a dreamy, sort of druggy way.The band’s debut album, Your Day Will Come, expands on those dreams and drugs, and delights in more uncommon juxtapositions. It is both Lil Peep and Massive Attack; Prefab Sprout and Yung Lean; a record made by people who really freak out about music, who know every twist and turn on Steely Dan’s Aja and are crazy enough to say, but what if we kind of rapped over this? It is a risky proposition, difficult to avoid seeming winky or gimmicky, but more often than not, the results are supremely lovely. On “Unifying Thought,” Lavers sounds like he’s singing through a waterfall inside a mall. “I don’t do molly anymore,” he sings at the song’s outset, before it gets beatific, with crescendoing strings crashing into a wash of guitars. He continues: “If you love me, I love you more.”The general approach of Your Day Will Come is to find that provocative sweet spot between being chintzy and being sincere. To fuck around, but with discipline. In practice, this usually means doing something like cutting elevator music with open chords on an acoustic guitar. It means adding some Seinfeld slap bass on the velvety downtempo track “Embarrassed Dog” and having it somehow feel completely intuitive. Or on “Police Scanner,” where the hand-clap drum machine loops and shoegaze guitars get all freaked out by Lavers’ vocals, the repetition of little “yeahs,” which are performed with the same sort of energy of watching Ren & Stimpy reruns in your parents’ basement—paranoia pop, you might call it.For all its oblique melodies and wobbly production, Your Day Will Come evokes a strange kind of beauty. It’s tied together by the ambient outlier, “Coffee Culture,” a gentle drone of strings, synthetic choirs, dulcimers, and some sort of digitally-treated wind instrument. It’s a welcome break, a comfortable silence. This is the kind of New York cool the band traffics in, not one born of disaffection but of sincerity. More than anything else, Your Day Will Come is cool because it’s a good hang. Like you’re sitting shotgun in the car of someone you have a crush on and you’re taking turns being DJ. Like: you are riding your bike and you are a little bit drunk and it is 90 degrees so you’re wearing a rash guard because baby, you burn easily. It seems to say: to give one shit, to care about your art, to maybe even be a little funny about it, is it so uncool?All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

317,"The experimental composer’s new album is a shapeshifting stream of crackling electronics, wordless singing, and gasping breaths. It’s a stark, solitary listen that radiates an unsettling beauty. Ka Baird entered 2022 feeling adrift. The two years of lockdowns and shutdowns had been difficult for the artist, whose practice—an improvisatory fusion of wordless vocalizations, movement, and crackling electronics—is deeply dependent upon the intimacy of live performance. At Chicago’s Lampo foundation, they developed a new solo piece, Bearings, to be performed 10 times over the course of two nights that spring, for an audience of between one and four people. Pacing the stage, deploying disorienting shifts in lighting and sound design, alternating between bursts of flute and ghostly hissing and chattering, Baird hoped to trigger a mixture of confusion and catharsis—the kind of soul-cleansing experience that might mark a new beginning, helping artist and audience alike get their bearings in a world turned strange. Then, just weeks before the show was to launch, Baird’s mother experienced an unexpected decline in health; the diagnosis was terminal.Baird went ahead with Bearings—the final performance punctuated, serendipitously, by a fireworks display visible through the venue’s windows. After the shows, they decamped to Decatur, Illinois, where, alongside their brother, they spent the next six months caring for their mother. While she slept, Baird worked on music. On September 1, Karen Faye Lepp Baird died at the age of 79 in her children’s arms, taking her last breath as the sun set. The loss inspired Baird to become an end-of-life doula and also gave shape to their new album Bearings: Soundtracks for the Bardos, helping to channel the purifying intensity of the Lampo performances into an unpredictable, electric form. Baird’s music has often resembled a metaphorical transmission from another realm. With Bearings, they press forward into the rift.The album’s organizing principle is the bardo, which Tibetan Buddhism conceives as a portal, such as those traversed by the dying on their passage from life to rebirth. “We are always in a bardo,” writes Baird in the album’s liner notes, “because impermanence never takes a break.” The titling of the album’s 11 tracks, from “Gate I” to “Gate XI,” suggests a succession of doorways, yet Bearings feels less like a collection of discrete pieces than a perpetually unfolding chain of events—a single stream of energy, writhing and twisting and forever taking on new shapes.The album begins with a low, grinding hum haloed by overtones and bristling with fizz, and it ends with a similar drone pitched exactly one interval higher—as though the idea of ascension were coded directly into the music’s frequencies. In between those bookends, Baird utilizes many of the same techniques that distinguished 2019’s Respires. Their voice sounds more animal than human—hissing, groaning, growling, croaking. Electronic signals pulse in waves, like anxious dial tones; atonal blasts of flute buffet long, flat expanses of wordless singing, like gusts of wind smacking against plate glass windows. The occasional peal of trumpet or plucked viola serve as one of a handful of recurring motifs, like signposts along the soul’s journey. The force that holds it all together is the tension between flowing and stopping—an uneasy give-and-take punctuated by percussive flurries and sudden moments of silence. The only lyrics are a repeated refrain of “Here, disappear, poof,” yet even these words are indistinguishable from a magician’s smoke grenade, just bursts of breath dissipating against the buzz.",Experimental,7.9
318,"Three weeks after We Don’t Trust You, Future and Metro return with another 90-minute cinematic project that’s mostly the same but a little bit better. Earlier in their careers, Future and Metro Boomin always sounded committed to bringing the best and the weirdest out of each other. The menace in the pits of Metro’s beats matched Future’s drug tales and bouts of dead-eyed hedonism, and darker, stranger variants on that chemistry kept things exciting. Whether it’s the seething snap of an “I Serve the Base,” the creaking minimalism of a “My Collection,” or the fidgety pomp of a “Jumpman,” the duo always pushed the boundaries of mainstream trap in seedier directions.And that was the biggest issue with their first official collaborative album We Don’t Trust You. They still crafted a few mean sleeper hits, but outside of the rich-guy rapper beef simmering in between the lines, their edges had dulled. For all the buildup, too many of those songs took the Capital-R Rap Album prompt too seriously, rehashing old ideas in grander, blander ways. The double-disc sequel album, We Still Don’t Trust You, is a more encouraging heel turn. Future and Metro sharpen some of that bite by bringing their ears to a brighter, slightly sappier space.It’s still familiar ground for both of them. Future, in particular, is back in the emotional headspace that fueled so much of HNDRXX, swirling between flexing from his throne and lovesick come-ons. He still relishes playing the villain on occasion—“One Big Family” is about juggling upwards of 20 women at a time, three of whom share the same name—but there’s just as much tear-soaked reflection over exes and post-coital shopping sprees. On the neon-bright “Drink N Dance,” he croons about racing Maybachs and throwing lavish sex parties in Abu Dhabi like he just found a rare foil Pokemon card. Later, on “Mile High Memories,” he’s looking for silver linings in a lover who might be doing him dirty, belting “You can fuck on him as long as you thinkin’ ‘bout me,” trying and failing to sound above it all. It isn’t often that Future gets the short end of the stick, and hearing him jump between player and patsy, sometimes in the same song, remains electrifying.For Metro’s part, he’s actually found a way to turn the Achilles’ heel of his post-COVID output—production that sounds too polished and anonymous—into a strength. The title track veers toward synth-pop that wouldn’t sound out of place on The Weeknd’s Dawn FM, complete with Abel mocking his old label OVO in falsetto (“They shooters making TikToks!”). Several songs dip into various shades of R&B, from the new-age Isley Brothers smoothness of “All to Myself” to “Gracious,” which sounds like a stripped-back version of the kind of plugg&b that Summrs or Highway would drool over.",Rap,7.1
319,"The D.C. punks channel their hometown scene’s confrontational spirit on a debut album that backs its progressive politics with a fierce belief in the necessity of joy. Before moving the tassel on his graduation cap from right to left, Liam Hughes started a punk band with his best friend, Jael Holzman. For Hughes, the group doubled as a graduate thesis and a sneaky way to access American University’s recording studio. For Holzman, it was an opportunity to vent. She sang openly about her experiences as a trans woman, and those lyrics felt like a beacon for incoming band members Miri Tyler and Guinevere Tully. After releasing a 2022 EP under the name Ekko Astral, the Washington, D.C., punk outfit expanded into a five-piece with more on the line than just a framed degree: Ekko Astral’s community-building efforts in the local scene transformed them into a sounding board for DIY fans who felt seen.If Ekko Astral sound brash and impulsive, there’s a good reason: When she’s not behind the mic, Holzman works as an energy and climate reporter, staring down headlines like “The Flooding Will Come No Matter What” even as her rights are increasingly being stripped away. Words spew out of her mouth as though the concept of a filter were laughable. But the band isn’t as reckless as its songs suggest. They quite literally sat down to brainstorm ways that their debut album, pink balloons, might foster a better future. What Ekko Astral produced was a collection of experimental punk and noise-rock songs that weld together two ideas: We’ve got to stop softening our opinions just to minimize others’ discomfort, and we’ve got to start having fun again. Ekko Astral apply those tenets wholesale to dinner-spoiling conversation subjects—the pain of aging, murder and death, the wretched anxiety of being terminally online—with beatific results.pink balloons’ noise-punk barrage hits like a stray elbow in the mascara moshpit. Ekko Astral smear raw punk, distorted pop hooks, and experimental noise like they’re wiping dirt on their lids in place of eye shadow. Coursing through them is the distinct charisma of D.C. bands past: the chaotic unpredictability of Black Eyes, the palpable urgency of Fugazi, the commanding vocal control of Priests. Opener “head empty blues” is abrasive and unrelenting, stacking Tully’s thick bassline atop Tyler’s racing drums and the stabbing guitars of Hughes and Sam Elmore. There’s barely a second to catch your breath before “baethoven” begins, its ominous organ whirring behind a post-punk rhythm that catches fire the way a Gilla Band song douses itself in gasoline. Ekko Astral cut and push and warp, sneaking in panning vocals and submarine beeps that work thanks to Pure Adult’s Jeremy Snyder, who allows the band to level up with clean, layered production that doesn’t sacrifice their punk spirit.",Rock,8.0
320,"Soft-hearted and whisper-voiced, Chicago singer-songwriter Jessica Viscius’ band reflects on loneliness and loss with no hint of resentment. There is a special ache that sets in after any big ending. It doesn’t need to be a breakup; it could be a death, moving out of an apartment, or settling in for bedtime at the end of an especially perfect day. Throughout their seven-year career, Chicago soft rockers Bnny have sat in this wounded sadness like a frog on a pond. Their second album, One Million Love Songs, finds power in it, using rough-hewn layers of guitar to break open singer-songwriter Jessica Viscius’ teary-eyed world.Viscius’ grief-struck 2021 debut, Everything, excavated some of her pain following the 2017 death of her partner, the musician Trey Gruber. (Viscius is also a former graphic designer for Pitchfork.) It was slow and frostbitten, with Viscius’ voice interrupting cold silences like dust, but One Million Love Songs furnishes the abandoned house with a more delirious form of acceptance. Constant disappointment is okay, or at least tolerable, because it proves you’re alive. “I’m just born blue,” Viscius sings on the anthemic “Crazy, Baby,” dripping with Angel Olsen’s melted ice cream inflection.Bnny’s sorrow flows from a breakup, this time. Wednesday producer Alex Farrar helps make it brighter with little rhinestone details, like the heartbeat thump of the drums on “Get It Right” that propels Viscius’ promise that “I’m trying, I’m trying, I’m trying.” “Good Stuff” sparkles like a ruby slipper, spinning out into a Sheryl Crow chorus: “I’m hanging on/To the sunshine,” Viscius sings with abandon, like she turned up the car radio, “I’m hanging on/To my big love.”But, unlike comparable breakup music—“burn it down and pack it into a lipstick tube” albums like Jagged Little Pill or, more recently, Sour—One Million Love Songs is never indignant. It doesn’t imagine keying anyone’s pickup truck. Bnny’s music feels more like surrendering to the “million” disappointing outcomes of love, the introverted antithesis to the Magnetic Fields’ 69 Love Songs: the urgent need to acknowledge that you could end up alone. The firefly blink of the acoustic closing track, “No One,” makes this abundantly clear. “Burned some bridges/And burned some doors/Now no one loves me anymore,” sings Viscius, resigned. So, what should you do—lash out? No, you savor the mystery.Sometimes, the lyrics on One Million Love Songs unhelpfully pull you from your seat just when it’s just starting to get good. Lines like “trying to walk straight/But I’m stumbling/Trying to forget you/But I’m struggling” feel more like getting lost in RhymeZone than in Viscius’ otherwise lovely garden. But the album masters melancholy anyway, using careful guitar and vocal flourishes to make the music’s embryonic self-consciousness feel urgent, like it’s yours. There’s power in reclaiming unhappiness, allowing it to become a piece of your heart instead of a weight on your back.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

321,"The Norwegian alt-pop singer’s second album feels both evocatively raw and painfully shallow. I’M DOING IT AGAIN BABY! starts in a better place than girl in red’s 2021 debut, if i could make it go quiet. Gone are Marie Ulven’s intrusive thoughts about physically hurting her loved ones and herself, the spiraling anxieties that seemed to plague her every moment. In their place, she’s discovered a newfound self-confidence and some much-needed stability. Maybe, as she suggests on the opening song “I’m Back,” taking some time away from the music industry helped. But mental illness is a lifelong struggle, and while she’s eager to say, “I love being alive,” she’s careful to caveat it: “At least for now.” On her second album, Ulven approaches familiar topics—unrequited love, self-doubt, the pains of growing up—with a stronger sense of self, sounding both softer and more fierce than before. As a queer pop star with a firm grasp on her own emotional failings, girl in red addresses common issues from a unique perspective. But too often, her lyrical ambitions fall short of their lofty goals.Ulven’s strength as a lyricist is also her weakness: The 25-year-old artist writes about romance and heartbreak as if she’s the first person ever to experience them. On “A Night to Remember,” her giddiness is infectious, the propulsive dance-pop and palpable excitement (“The whisper in my ear/Saying let’s get outta here/Yeah, I’ve never been so light on my feet”) helping to smooth over some of the song’s clunkier lines (“Cocaine and weirdos” is a club descriptor best saved for the next day’s recap text). “Too Much” vividly channels the fury of a relationship breakdown: “House always wins, so I’m taking all my love back/With you I lose either way.”Ulven writes about her own experiences with a remarkable degree of honesty and clarity, but more profound revelations are just out of reach. At its best, her naivete is evocatively raw. “Phantom Pain” recasts a trite turn of phrase into a genuine moment of self-reflection: “I really didn’t notice the heart on my sleeve/I think I got invested in you and me.” But it’s hard not to wish for more insight—breakup sentiments like “I wish I never met you in the first place” feel inanely common. The slick production across I’M DOING IT AGAIN BABY!—helmed by Ulven and fellow Norwegian Matias Tellez—would be better served with more nuance. Their warm synths and her textured growls call for deeper feelings. In contrast to its lyrical shortcomings, her second album is sonically richer, balancing the delicate piano on “I’m Back” against heavier basslines on “Ugly Side.” Ulven’s voice also extends further than before, cracking into a roar on “Phantom Pain” and retreating into mellower territory on “Pick Me.”",Pop,6.2
322,"Beneath the thick veneer of droll affectation, this London-via-Scunthorpe band writes with uncommon poignancy about the nature of art, ambition, and success. In a parallel universe—one where indie rock reigns supreme and continually seeks out poets of deadpan absurdism—critics are already celebrating So Medieval like a promising novelist’s debut splash. The blurb touts “a tale of musical ambition and romantic anguish, told through continental capers involving raw halloumi, a Formula One audiobook, and the ‘shitpost sagas’ of once-in-a-generation voice Arthur Nolan.” Our expectations are pegged to Blue Bendy’s chatty UK peers—Dry Cleaning, Squid, et al.—then sharply raised as we learn the band has “coined a formally daring new language,” perhaps positioned “between the indie disco and the next morning’s social media scroll.” Emblazoned on the back cover of this literary-musical opus are quotes from Jarvis Cocker, Yung Lean, and for some reason Zadie Smith.In reality, the vagaries of hype have mostly eluded this London-via-Scunthorpe band, which says a little about their admittedly niche appeal and a little more about the British music media’s imperiled hype apparatus. Thankfully, the lack of actual acclaim has done nothing to deter Nolan from flooding his songs with gnomic brags, eccentric alter egos, and the non sequiturs that are his loopy lingua franca. Blue Bendy’s debut EP, 2022’s Motorbike, was two years late for the critics’ anointing of monologue-rock darlings, but unified just enough inputs to feel dizzyingly new: handclap indie-pop swarmed by Warp-inspired synth ad-libs and a preponderance of too-online slang. Fretting he might be “the only one swagging in the deep,” in a world “powered by Unreal Engine,” Nolan presented a persona akin to the Wedding Present’s David Gedge getting initiated into Drain Gang during a game of Fortnite Squads.With So Medieval, Blue Bendy return to the province of realism, using their underdog status as a springboard to defiant, high-stakes art-rock. The story loosely follows a “memelord type” narrator throwing it all in for the band after a rough breakup. His chronicles of misery and mischief can rise to emotional rapture (Nolan calls this “dying on the mic”) or plunge into endearing hysteria, as on “Mr. Bubblegum”: “I can handle being the third-best guitar band in London,” he cries, “but baby, just let me be first at something.” Neither the melodrama nor the hubris are lost on the 27-year-old frontman, who takes a moment, on “I’m Sorry I Left Him to Bleed,” to reassure us he is in on the joke: “I’ll get better somehow/But for now I’m just the boy/You made feel like Kendall Roy—wow.”When he is not wowing his own zingers, Nolan writes touchingly about life in a band seized by music’s contradictory demands: Success is important because it lets you make more art; art is important because it has nothing to do with success. On “Cloudy,” Nolan dramatizes the grind through a series of absurd quibbles (“I’ve got beef with a monkey account”) and indignant pleas (“We’ve been struggling for miles/Where are my memetic flowers?”) in a tone so relentlessly silly you sense he is desperately serious. The band sounds embroiled in the same scrap for a shot at majesty, sharing the Black Country, New Road playbook of minimalist-classical hooks scaled for folk-pop magnitude. The precious and grandiose converge throughout the album, each part a foil to Nolan’s dual personality. Guitarists Joe Nash and Harrison Charles slingshot between folksy humility and post-rock gusto, while synth whiz Olivia Morgan alternates sly Stereolab filigree with baroque-pop extravagance.",Experimental,8.0
323,"In the second volume in a series of free-flowing, ambient-tinged mini-albums, the composer—daughter of the late sitar virtuoso Pandit Ravi Shankar—seeks out a new vocabulary for her instrument. For almost two decades, Anoushka Shankar has been on a mission to liberate the sitar from both the rigid strictures of the Indian classical tradition and the Orientalist cliches of hippie spirituality that the instrument often invokes in the West. She’s no iconoclast; Shankar continues to perform Hindustani classical music, including compositions by her father, the late Pandit Ravi Shankar. But for the London-born musician, who grew up between the UK, Delhi, and Los Angeles, that tradition represents just one of the many possibilities presented by the medieval stringed instrument.Since her third studio album, 2005’s Rise, Shankar has explored ways to slip the sitar into new contexts. She has used the instrument to address contemporary social issues—the Syrian refugee crisis, or violence against women in India—and make grand arguments about the interconnectedness of different musical traditions. Last year, she embarked on a new project, one less focused on the outer world than the inner life of the mind: a trilogy of mini-albums, each recorded in a different space with different collaborators, interlinked yet capable of standing on their own. She set one condition for herself: to enter the studio with a blank slate, open to wherever the moment might take her. The series’ first installment, Chapter I: Forever, for Now, emerged from a single memory, an afternoon with her kids in the garden of her London home.Chapter II: How Dark It Is Before Dawn picks up where its predecessor left off, moving from the warm, cozy intimacy of the late afternoon to the more ambiguous emotional landscape of the deepest night. In Shankar’s conception, the night is a sanctuary, a retreat from the indignities and psychic wounds of the day—a time for healing and contemplation. But with its shadows and all-encompassing darkness, the night also belongs to nightmares, bogeymen, and all sorts of things that go bump in the dark.Largely written and recorded over a few days at composer and producer Peter Raeburn’s studio in California, the six tracks on Chapter II chart a journey through the night’s many iterations, leading up to the first gleam of daybreak. Best known for his award-winning film scores, Raeburn brings a strong cinematic sensibility to the production and arrangement. While Chapter I—produced by Arooj Aftab—was airy and minimalist, with each note blown up to cosmic proportions, the new record is more ambient and atmospheric, the sitar pulsing bright through layers of drones and electronics.The dreamy synths and gently propulsive piano of “Pacifica” conjure a limitless horizon, over which Shankar’s sitar traces delicate, twilight-hued patterns. On “Offering,” reverb-drenched sitar notes unfurl and mutate. Three minutes in, a melody finally emerges, at first muted but slowly swelling in intensity and brightness, like consciousness emerging from meditation, carrying with it the memory of a connection to something greater.",Folk,7.4
324,"The British producer’s debut full-length illustrates her gift for rewiring jungle into arena-sized pop catharsis. The self-described “emotional junglist” Nia Archives sings cursive melodies over some of the most relentless breakbeats you’ve ever heard. It’s the sound of 100 thoughts racing through your head when you realize your situationship lied to you. A few years ago, she was balancing school with a job at the UK pub chain Wetherspoons, paying out of pocket for Instagram ads to promote her first song. Soon, she became a leader of a widespread jungle and drum’n’bass revival alongside artists like dazegxd and SHERELLE. The scene has had a slew of TikTok hits and bite-sized EPs, but no defining project—until now.Silence Is Loud injects jungle with the glittery immediacy of pop ballads. It’s emo and elated, a diary blown up into sleek yet sensitive anthems made for arena-sized catharsis. Nia is a jungle obsessive, but she’s more concerned with honoring its culture and history than imitating any one of the myriad strains spawned in its ’90s golden age. In one interview, she describes her broad interpretation of the genre as “modern-day punk music in a dance space.” This loose understanding explains why her style has always been so malleable and unruly (for starters, on her last EP, she rewired the genre with bossa nova and sped-up Brazilian body music).She’s keen to reshape a genre historically piloted by men, in which producers rarely reference their personal lives. Nia sings fiercely about things like unrequited desire, spinning out into soulful melodies and gleaming trills. The percussion simultaneously buries and intensifies her voice, giving her cover to unleash distressing fears. On “F.A.M.I.L.Y,” Nia talks about feeling alienated from her relatives, but the molten bass and singalong chorus nearly trick you into thinking it’s a positive power-bop. “Nightmares” possesses the vitriol of a novella-length hate text: Nia disses a lying man with such jaunty keys and cheeky moxie that it’ll make even the fuckboys smile.While the music aspires to feel both clubby and confessional, many songs offer only vague sketches of emotional conflicts, trading concrete details for catchy rhymes. This works on “Cards on the Table,” where she somersaults across the guitars’ spindly groove. But it can also feel too neat and radio-packaged; the smooth vocal rhythm sometimes misaligns with the prickly worries she’s sharing. In the absence of nuanced insights or anecdotal texture, her struggles can come across trite at times—like, who hasn’t felt lonely in a crowded room?But maybe emotional specificity isn’t the whole point. Instead, it’s this combo of party-hard sincerity that makes her music so punchy, like she’s animatedly telling secrets to a friend while wildly raving. And unlike the madcap cyber junglists of today, who adorn beats in delirious fuzz and frazzled digi-chaos, she hews closely to the pristine angularity of classic jungle percussion, each drum hitting with a satisfying sharpness. She’s the modern link between the genre’s past and present, palling around with new-gen producers and ’90s pioneers alike; Goldie makes a brief cameo on the dizzyingly lovesick “Tell Me What It’s Like?” to pump her up.",Electronic,7.3
325,"The German producer abandons his customarily bass-heavy breakbeats in favor of smooth, pumping techno. It’s an unexpected shift, but the details and the dynamism are pure Skee Mask. “In the beginning, there was Jack, and Jack had a groove.” Last August, that iconic line from Rhythm Controll’s oft-sampled 1987 classic “My House” was the opening salvo to Skee Mask’s back-to-back set with Rotterdam DJ Stranger at Amsterdam’s Dekmantel Festival. The echoing proclamation served as the setup for a stuck-in-reverse hardgroove loop that seemed to tear open a hole in space-time, sucking in all those within earshot of the UFO II stage. Inside the rift, Skee Mask and Stranger dished out a barrage of classic techno from the likes of Ben Sims, Jeff Mills, and Joey Beltram.It was an unexpected stylistic shift from Skee Mask, real name Bryan Müller, who’s best known for cobbling together unpredictable broken rhythms from a number of bass- and breakbeats-heavy genres. On ISS010, the 10th EP from Ilian Tape’s Ilian Skee Series, he makes his most extensive foray yet into techno. From start to finish, the record runs on bouncy, tightly looped four-on-the-floor grooves that pump like greased-up pistons. But don’t mistake their repetition for monotony; if the pounding kicks are Müller’s sturdy chassis, then the peripherals are his hissing hydraulics, warm neon underglow, and spinning rims.On “Matchpoint,” the repetitive bassline may induce mild tunnel vision, but Müller’s amorphous percussion is the star of the show. He cycles through an unhinged carousel of different hi-hats, switching up patterns and continuously tweaking delays, echoes, filters, and slippery reverse effects. The following track, “Double Standard,” puts similarly dubby synths to more aquatic ends, swirling them around a chugging monolith of a groove. The way that Müller slaps in different percussive elements with an audible thwap brings to mind Jeff Mills, whom Müller has more than once posted about on X (formerly Twitter), trying to ID a long-lost track from a 1995 DJ set at Germany’s Slam Club. Mills is a maestro behind the decks, commanding the gear to do his bidding, and Müller suggests a similar assuredness in the studio, tinkering away in what sounds like an invincible flow state.“Stomp” is where Müller applies the blissful synth and pad work from Compro to his new techno experiments. Easing off the accelerator a bit, he introduces the first breakbeat of the EP. For a moment, rigid techno and breaks rhythms scrape against each other before Müller welds them together with a synth swell that glows white hot. Just when they feel like they’re going to come apart, he fires off another arc, with melodic sparks flying off into the distance. Before the track ends, Müller indulges in a bit of IDM deconstruction that further bridges the gap between ISS010 and his previous work, if only for a moment. The callback is a welcome reprieve from a hardgroove-leaning onslaught.",Electronic,7.4
326,"The Lil Yachty-led rap crew’s debut mixtape has a handful of memorable moments, but its members are mostly on autopilot. First, Lil Yachty spent a year doing so-so Michigan rapper cosplay. Then he moved on to his Tame Impala wannabe vanity project. Now, his next racket is a rap crew. That group is Concrete Boys, a five-member collective that, with Yachty as their frontman, includes the rappers Camo!, Draft Day, Karrahbooo, and Dc2trill (the latter is from Texas, and the only one of the five without any ties to Atlanta). In the last few months, the clique has formally introduced themselves with a string of pretty music videos, a viral On the Radar freestyle, and color-coordinated photo shoots. All of these efforts have led up to their debut compilation album It’s Us Vol. 1, where they seem to be presenting themselves as a modern-day version of the kind of rap crews who would have had a spread in a mid-’90s issue of The Source. That homage is loose and mostly sartorial instead of musical: On the album cover, the five are dressed in vintage Polo Sport and Tommy Hilfiger, Timberland boots, and jean shorts—outfits that make them look like they’re extras in Hulu’s Wu-Tang: An American Saga.It’s Us Vol. 1 has much less of an identity than Concrete Boys’ fit pics. Their thing is that they’re cool, I guess. That wouldn’t be a problem if the music itself oozed cool. The album just doesn’t do that. In fact, the main appeal is that it’s an innocuous, easy-listening collection of songs—perfect to throw on in the background while you chat with your friends or pass time on your commute. Like Drake, Yachty has become an expert at dissecting and shaving the rough edges off regional and internet sounds. Here, he’s streamlined the highly collaborative, shit-talking spirit he picked up in Michigan, giving that style a neater, smoother, and more widely accessible sheen (If you’ve wished for music with the structure of Michigan rap, but with less chaos, then this is for you). For instance, the tape is heavy on punchline-based rhyming, but the bars are fairly tame and only mildly clever. And there are a decent number of beats that bring to mind the chill bounce of Detroit producer Topside’s instrumentals for Baby Smoove and Babyface Ray, except they’re not as funky (see: “Playa Walkin”). One way or another, it’s hard to get worked up about this music.Each member of Concrete Boys has their moments. Draft Day has the most memorable voice of the crew, like he’s rapping with strep throat. It’s best in spurts, but when he pops back in on “2 Hands 2 Eyes 10 Whips/Rent Due” for a second verse after a hardened beat switch-up, his strained vocals reach Lil Wop levels, which gives the song an energy boost. Camo! is the most anonymous of the bunch—not sure what’s going on with that Jersey club flip of Pinegrove he sings over on the intro—but he can sometimes drift into a Lil Wayne-influenced zone of wisecracks. “Put my fingers inside her holes, I’m tryna bowl you,” he spits on “Hit Diff.” That’s about as funny as he gets. Dc2trill is the clique’s smooth-talker; he’s decent at it, gliding with a Curren$y-like ease on the jazzy “My Life.” Yachty is pretty much on autopilot, but he seems to have a good time when he raps with Karrahbooo. Surprisingly, her bored, deadpan flow on highlights like “Where Yo Daddy?” and “Not Da 2” has a way of making pretty simple flexes and quips stick.It’s Us Vol. 1 mostly works as a launchpad for Karrahbooo; she’s the only one of the bunch who will leave you wanting to hear a solo mixtape. The video for their On the Radar cypher—the recording of which is included on the tape—is a solid glimpse at that potential. For four and a half minutes, the boys spit inoffensive and fine-enough verses that eventually blend together over a hypnotic, naked sax sample. It’s all build-up for the final minute, where the song really comes alive. There, Karrahbooo takes the floor, as the skittering Michigan drums kick in and her unbothered, sleepwalking flow elevates a show-offy trip down memory lane: “I was sellin’ lemonade while y’all would double dutch/I used to scam, I used to trap, I never cuddled much.” In that minute, you almost forget anything that came before her verse—aside from the fact that the guys had on nice outfits.",Rap,6.1
327,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit the Waterboys’ definitive statement, a sweeping rock album from 1985 that pours its heart out from start to finish. When the Waterboys founder Mike Scott was a teenager living in Edinburgh, he published a fanzine called Jungleland. The sixth issue, which came out at the end of 1977, had Richard Hell on the cover and teased articles about the Sex Pistols and Graham Parker. That Scott named his zine after the final song on Bruce Springsteen’s album Born to Run suggested that the angry energy of punk—a force that exerts an outsized pull on the young—was tempered by a yearning spirituality. For Scott, music offered a portal into a new way of seeing the world, one charged with romance, something you could get swept up in, where life seems so full of excitement and possibility it’s like a swelling container just about to burst.Another coverline for “Jungleland” No. 6 is Patti Smith. When the Patti Smith Group came to London while touring Easter in 1978, Scott, on a hunch, called the hotel where he thought the singer might be staying and asked to speak with her, and the front desk patched him through. He asked if she’d received a package of zines he’d sent (she hadn’t), and after a brief chat she invited him down to London to cover the show. He took the train down, met his hero, hung out with her band, befriended her guitarist, Lenny Kaye, and stayed in a room in the fancy hotel she had arranged. Five years later, when Scott placed an advertisement in the NME classifieds seeking bandmates, he described what he was looking for:THE WATERBOYS REQUIRE LEAD/RHYTHM GUITAR PLAYER. 18-24. Ability, own style, and appreciation of Patti Smith essential.A few additional data points to help us understand Scott: When on holiday with his mother to London at age 16, he popped into a studio advertised in Melody Maker and recorded a version of Bob Dylan’s “Like a Rolling Stone,” playing most of the instruments himself. He wanted to see how records were made. Scott’s first band was called White Heat, named after Lou Reed’s song, and the name of the Waterboys was taken from a line in Reed’s “The Kids,” from Berlin. Other fixations during his youth were David Bowie and Van Morrison.So that’s Dylan, Patti, Bruce, Van, Lou, Bowie, and punk rock—inspirations that all seemed in conversation with one another. Springsteen was once the New Dylan, and Patti was taking rock’n’roll poetics into strange places; Bruce and Patti had met each other in song on “Because the Night”; Springsteen’s second LP was deeply indebted to Van Morrison, and Patti had of course had transformed “Gloria,” the signature tune of Van’s early days, on her album Horses; Bowie had covered Reed and Springsteen both, and was, like the latter, punk rock royalty; Springsteen had shown up on Reed’s “Street Hassle.”",Rock,9.3
328,"Paying tribute to the late bassist Ahmed Abdul-Malik in a 2022 live recording, this European jazz quartet turns an understated 1961 single into a thundering, hourlong rave-up. On a cold spring night in 2022, the jazz quartet أحمد [Ahmed] set up at one end of the long, narrow warehouse space of Glasgow’s industrial-chic Glue Factory. Their muse and namesake Ahmed Abdul-Malik was there in spirit. The setlist consisted of only one song: the late jazz musician’s “Oud Blues,” which runs to about four minutes in the original 1961 version. By the time أحمد [Ahmed] finished with it, they had been playing for nearly an hour.Wood Blues is a recording of that phenomenal performance—at once a cover song, an avant-garde improv session, and a driving, swinging jazz concert. أحمد [Ahmed] have been honing the conceit for a decade: Every show, they choose an Abdul-Malik composition and turn it inside out. Pianist Pat Thomas discovered the little-known bassist and oudist in the 1980s and immediately recognized his significance. Born Jonathan Tim, Jr. in Brooklyn to immigrant parents, Abdul-Malik changed his name to assert his Islamic identity and Sudanese lineage. His family was from the Caribbean, not Sudan, but he reached back further, reclaiming his diasporic African heritage. As a bandleader, Abdul-Malik incorporated Arabic instruments—qanun, darbuka, a violin tuned to fourths and fifths—into his ensembles. His late ’50s and early ’60s albums like Jazz Sahara and East Meets West ushered in the new form of modal jazz alongside landmark recordings by Miles Davis and John Coltrane.Thomas wanted to revive Abdul-Malik’s music, to turn a footnote into a headline. Saxophonist Seymour Wright shared his interest and joined Thomas’s trio اسم [ISM], with bassist Joel Grip and drummer Antonin Gerbal, to form أحمد [Ahmed]. Together, they’re something of a supergroup, each player a star in a different constellation of the European improvised music scene. They only perform live, with no practice or advance planning. But from their separate cities—Thomas and Wright in London, Grip in Berlin, Gerbal in Paris—they’re always thinking about Abdul-Malik. When they play one of his songs, all that thinking comes out in a torrent of sound.Wood Blues is at once thrillingly violent and fervently faithful in its transformations of Abdul-Malik’s material, altering the original beyond recognition yet keeping its spirit alive. The recording begins with the audience chattering as Grip plays the walking bassline of “Oud Blues.” Thomas adds melodic piano flourishes and Gerbal lays down a shuffling beat. Wright supports with short percussive clicks from his saxophone, then extends those clicks into bursts, trading licks with Thomas, who bangs on the keys with increasing force. There’s a shift in the room as the audience goes quiet. Piano and sax merge into a single pummeling attack. Gerbal keeps time with a steady tom-tom pulse, and Grip carries the melody through the fray. The moment can’t last long, and soon the band is propelled by a frantic rhythm, Thomas pounding the piano, Wright blowing with frightening power, the crowd now shouting, screaming, dancing.",Jazz,8.2
329,"The sprawling and spectacular Cindy Lee album is an essential trove of music. Each song is like a foggy transmission from a rock’n’roll netherworld with its own ghostly canon of beloved hits. This may be the greatest radio station you’ve ever come across. Unless it’s multiple stations talking over each other, in and out of range. Sounds arrive in strange combinations; nothing is quite exactly the way you remember. Did that classic rock band really have a synth player, and why did they pick a patch that sounds like a mosquito buzzing through a cheap distortion pedal? And those eerie harmonies swirling at the outskirts of that last-dance ballad by some 1960s girl group whose name ends in -elles or -ettes. Did they hire a few heartbroken ghosts who were hanging around the studio as backing vocalists? Or are these fragments of other songs, other signals, surfacing like distant headlights over a hill, then disappearing once more?Or maybe this is Diamond Jubilee, the sprawling and spectacular new album by Cindy Lee: two hours, 32 songs, each one like a foggy transmission from a rock’n’roll netherworld with its own ghostly canon of beloved hits. Like much of Lee’s past work, its spiritual center is girl group music, reduced to a single girl and reflected through a hall of mirrors. From there, it extends toward the far reaches of the radio dial, and sometimes beyond: the warped classic rock of “Glitz,” the fragmented disco of “Olive Drab,” the sunburnt psychedelia of the title track, the nocturnal synth-pop of “GAYBLEVISION.” “Darling of the Diskoteque” sounds like Tom Waits and Marc Ribot masquerading as Santo and Johnny; “Le Machiniste Fantome” like a cue from some fictional Ennio Morricone score to a film about 9th-century monks. But even at its most idiosyncratic, the music conveys the archetypal yearning of pop. Nearly every song is about a lover who’s gone, and the dream that their loss—the solitary moonlit nights, the resolve to move on, the resignation to wallow forever—might be as romantic as the love itself.Lee is the glammed-up alter ego of songwriter, guitarist, and drag performer Patrick Flegel. In a different lifetime, they were the frontperson of Women, a brilliant and volatile Canadian post-punk band of the late 2000s. They flamed out quickly after two albums, an onstage fistfight, and the unrelated sudden death of one member, but their spindly guitar lines, asymmetrical rhythms, and surprisingly sweet melodies have remained influential on wide swaths of DIY rock. Flegel’s old bandmates formed Preoccupations and soon gravitated toward the crisp sonics and propulsive grooves of new wave. If Preoccupations found a stable middle ground between their old band’s extremes, Flegel pushed further out in both directions, donning a blue bob wig and Nancy Sinatra boots and releasing a series of albums as Cindy Lee that set pure pop songwriting alongside confrontational blasts of feedback.",Rock,9.1
330,"The singer-songwriter’s third album is her strongest yet, the sound of a wise, clear-eyed, melodious prodigy coming into her own voice. Eight years ago when a viral video thrust Maggie Rogers into the spotlight, she quickly went from NYU music student to public figure, garnering the type of cult following where the lines between artist and therapist start to blur. Since then, she has made efforts to slow things down. “I started to realize that there was this functional misalignment with the work that I had trained to do and the work that I was being asked to perform,” she told The New Yorker, explaining her decision to enroll in Harvard Divinity School in 2022. “I was put in this unconventional ministerial position without having undergone any of the training.” If strangers were going to look to her for guidance, her thinking went, then the best she could do would be to rise to the occasion.Her new album, Don’t Forget Me, released on the cusp of her earning her postgraduate degree, captures a self-assured songwriter and producer reflecting on her past experiences with clear eyes. Like Sheryl Crow and the Laurel Canyon scene before her, she’s not so much a prophet on the mount as she is a traveler sharing the lessons she’s learned in nearly 30 years of life. “Time moves slow/Until one day you wake up and you realize/That what you see is what you know,” she remarks on “All the Same,” deftly employing the second person. It’s comforting in the same way some of Joni Mitchell’s writing on Hejira is comforting: By acknowledging that she doesn’t have all the answers, Rogers ends up sounding wise beyond her years.Rogers wrote and recorded Don’t Forget Me over a whirlwind five days with producer Ian Fitchuk, whose cosmic country style blends commercial Nashville songwriting with elements of disco, psychedelic rock, and Tango in the Night-era Fleetwood Mac. Some of Don’t Forget Me is reminiscent of Fitchuk’s past work—lead single “So Sick of Dreaming” especially sounds like a cut off Kacey Musgraves’ Golden Hour—but Rogers carries her own smattering of influences that add nuance to his now-familiar sound. Several elements, like the expansive, effects-laden backdrop on “It Was Coming All Along” and looping drums on “If Now Was Then,” are an uncanny throwback to the Y2K pop-rock that Rogers likely grew up on: your Michelle Branches, your Natalie Imbruglias, your Sixpence None the Richers. Just like those artists’ anthemic singles, Don’t Forget Me keeps Rogers’ voice front and center, swelling to complement her on each chorus. It’s a welcome change from past albums, where the songwriting could sometimes feel like window dressing to Rogers’ more ornate compositions.",Pop,7.8
331,"The Australian singer and actor is blessed with a commanding and magnetic voice. Over these soul ballads and torch songs, she holds nothing back—for better or worse. Ramona, the third album from Melbourne belter Grace Cummings, feels at first like a possible masterpiece, a new apogee in the pantheon of tormented soul. Across its 11 allusion-rich character studies and screeds of lovelorn retribution, Cummings renders every moment with unmitigated emotional intensity, as though every feeling were the last one that would ever matter. Hear her grow, for instance, from long-faced tenderness at the start of “A Precious Thing” to an operatic mercenary howling about love. “But it’s nothing I care about,” she roars like Diamanda Galás on a Disney ride designed by Dante. Or witness the cracks in her voice as she surges beyond an Amy Winehouse coo during “Something Going ’Round,” testaments to the self-doubt ingrained in this opening love letter. Built by a band that has clearly studied the Wrecking Crew’s glories, and gilded with strings and harp, Ramona holds a singular and mighty voice in a spectacularly grand frame, not unlike Rufus Wainwright’s Want One or Weyes Blood’s Titanic Rising.But you know that friend who you love seeing for an hour every once in a while, who shares everything new about their life in an exhilarating but exhausting torrent? That could be Ramona after repeated spins, when Cummings’ lack of restraint, combined with the band’s hidebound insistence on repeating sounds that are often 60 years old, becomes too taxing to take for very long. After self-producing her first two records, Cummings linked with Topanga Canyon vintage king and session ace Jonathan Wilson, who freed her to focus on not holding back. That is commendable, but it results in an album that has the dynamic range and limited application of a strong flashlight. You recognize its incredible power, but you’d do best not to stare into the source for very long.Cummings is not shy about courting legendary company. After all, the protagonist of “Ramona,” a smoldering pseudo-goth number that ultimately flames into a full torch song, is borrowed from Bob Dylan. (She summons him again for the number’s finale, with sneering repetition that mirrors “Just Like a Woman.”) There’s a bit of Johnny Cash’s “Cry, Cry, Cry,” toward the end of “Everybody’s Somebody,” which borrows the sound of Memphis’ Stax rather than its Sun to impugn a wayward partner. She lifts from Townes Van Zandt during “Without You,” where she again flips Dylan lines twice. There are glimpses of Nick Cave and Nancy Sinatra and, in the album’s closing verse, Cummings quotes standards from Dylan, Neil Young, and George Harrison, like some thrift-store magpie. The band, led by Wilson and multi-instrumentalist Drew Erickson, responds in kind, stitching clear threads of Radiohead, Phil Spector, Hal Blaine, and Chris Isaak into these songs.",Folk,6.4
332,"Channeling new age and spiritual jazz, the multidisciplinary artist’s debut solo album creates its own thoughtful and potent world with the help of many guests and many flutes. Shabaka Hutchings’ tenor saxophone shows up exactly once on this album. Around 10 minutes before the LP ends, he summons the fierce momentum and sandpapery grit that have powered beloved bands like Sons of Kemet, the Comet Is Coming, and Shabaka and the Ancestors, and helped to make him one of the most celebrated jazz musicians of the past decade. As is usually the case when Shabaka—now billed by first name only—picks up what he has called the “big, loud, shiny horn,” the solo is thrilling. But this brief, incendiary statement carries a special weight in the wake of Shabaka’s announcement—made on New Year’s Day 2023 and clarified that summer—that he would be taking an indefinite hiatus from the tenor and his groups that feature that instrument.It’s easy to admire Shabaka’s stated reasons for putting down the horn: a feeling of burnout stemming from a heavy touring schedule that has kept him “on the road consistently treating the performance of a spiritual practice as a commodity to be sold repeatedly”; a quest to generate “energy without tension,” which has led him instead toward various flutes, including the Japanese shakuhachi and the clarinet, his original and, in his eyes, principle instrument. But could a Shabaka album with almost no tenor really have the same impact as his prior output? The answer is yes, absolutely, and that’s primarily because on Perceive Its Beauty, Acknowledge Its Grace—the artist’s first full-length statement in this vein, following a 2022 EP, Afrikan Culture—Shabaka hasn’t just subbed out one signature instrument for another; instead, he’s remade his music from the ground up.Shabaka’s prior work was as much dance music as jazz. You couldn’t help but move to the heady electro-funk of the Comet Is Coming, the mighty Afro-Caribbean grooves of Sons of Kemet, or the richly layered intercontinental exchange of Shabaka and the Ancestors. Perceive Its Beauty, on the other hand, focuses on tranquility, a sense of meditative communion with a variety of guest vocalists and instrumentalists. Of course, Shabaka is hardly the only musician thinking along these lines lately. New Blue Sun, André 3000’s own flute-pivot LP, which featured a Shabaka cameo on shakuhachi, signaled the mainstream arrival of a wave that’s been building steadily across the past decade or so wherein various questing sounds of the 1970s—from Alice Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders to Steve Reich, Brian Eno and private-press New Agers like Iasos— have swirled together in a plume of incense, wafting across the decades to inform artists working in and around jazz, electronic music, and more.",Jazz,8.0
333,"The Belgium-based composer—best known as a member of Stars of the Lid and A Winged Victory for the Sullen—steps out with a solo debut that plays like an ambient-drone crowd-pleaser. There’s something distinctly Texan about Adam Wiltzie’s music. With the late Brian McBride, the drone titan co-founded Stars of the Lid in 1993, releasing seven albums of ambient music as wispy and ethereal as a desert mirage. Though he’s lived in Belgium for nearly 25 years, he continues to produce music that suggests both the nearly incomprehensible vastness of the American West and the dread secrets it seems to contain. His new album Eleven Fugues for Sodium Pentothal sounds somewhere between a Western soundtrack and an emanation from an underground gas-mining operation, with tails of reverb from electric guitars bleeding into miasmas of strings and horns. Perhaps it’s time to think of Wiltzie in the tradition of European artists—the Wim Wenders of Paris, Texas, the Daft Punk of Electroma—fascinated with America’s enormity in contrast to the compact continent across the pond.Remembering Stars of the Lid’s Brian McBride With 10 Essential RecordsRemarkable though it might seem, given his lengthy string of collaborations and duo projects, this is Wiltzie’s first full-length under his own name. (It also contains only nine fugues for sodium pentothal—the co-author of “December Hunting for Vegetarian Fuckface” retains his streak of mischief.) Wiltzie spends a lot of the album’s runtime in his orchestral-drone comfort zone, but whenever the terrain threatens to sound too well trod, he pulls out something like “Dim Hopes,” with its twinkling constellation of vibraphones, or “Stock Horror,” which seems in the process of being ground up and devoured by the earth. “Tissue of Lies” is one of the catchiest things he’s written, with a friendly two-chord guitar motif that’s all the more mysterious for sounding so familiar: maybe a cousin of Slowdive’s “Trellisaze,” or a ghost of classic rock.Wiltzie has made plenty of music like this in the past, but it’s easy to forget that he hasn’t made much like it recently. His primary project for the last decade-plus has been A Winged Victory for the Sullen, his duo with Dustin O’Halloran, which feels a little more high-budget and magisterial than the almost self-deprecatingly quiet music he made in the first decade or so of his career: the self-titled Aix Em Klemm and Dead Texan albums, the sad and spectral emanations on the 2001 masterpiece The Tired Sounds of Stars of the Lid. (The Dead Texan, a collaboration with Christina Vantzou, particularly seems like a precedent for this record.) Is it a stretch to call an ambient drone album a crowd-pleaser? Wiltzie does everything you hope he will on Pentothal, and then some.",Experimental,7.6
334,"The Los Angeles-based artist’s full-length debut uses Peruvian chicha, Congolese soukous, and Afro-Colombian percussion to explore both personal grief and the abiding melancholy of diaspora. Grief demands its own impossible language. To confront the death of a loved one (or the lingering melancholy of diasporic displacement), you have to bend the rules. It requires new idioms, new phrases, new forms of expression altogether. To contend with these feelings, the Los Angeles-based musician Fabi Reyna, aka Reyna Tropical, turns to the wisdom of a pithy neologism: malegría.Borrowed from a 1998 Manu Chao song, the term mimics “bittersweetness” by colliding the Spanish words for “bad” and “happiness.” It’s a concept that captures the radiant emotional spectrum of Reyna’s debut full-length, released two years after the death of her bandmate, Nectali “Sumohair” Díaz, in an e-scooter accident. The record is an imaginative meditation on the possibilities of diasporic genre collage: Reyna, Díaz, and new collaborator Nay Mapalo collect hues of Peruvian chicha, Mexican zapateado, Congolese soukous, and a handful of other styles, glazing them over each other like a highly saturated watercolor painting. With its loose construction, inventive arrangements, and liturgical tranquility, Malegría is an incisive exploration of the porosity of diasporic life.Reyna is a nimble guitarist, able to glide fluidly between genres and settle in the space in between. “Lo Siento” is built on a bare-bones lyrical refrain about carrying knowledge that is painful, but the looping soukous melody feels soaked in marigold-colored light, as if she’d harnessed apricity itself. “Conexión Ancestral” is a high-gloss stylistic detour with a punchy four-on-the-floor foundation. “Suavecito” is a beaming prayer for serenity, built on dapples of Afro-Colombian percussion and a galloping dembow riddim. The song features London producer Busy Twist and Franklin Tejedor, one-half of Colombian electronic duo Mitú. Tejedor comes from a long line of percussionists in the UNESCO-recognized town of San Basilio de Palenque, the first free Black village of the Americas. He lends his voice and drumming to the track, opening the song with a spoken intro in San Basilio’s creole palenquero language. With its shimmering guitars and clacking folkloric drums, “Suavecito” reflects Reyna’s most exploratory impulses, conjuring an indelible moment of tropical futurist magic.The album is dotted with voice memos of conversations Reyna had with Díaz, doubling as a window into the pair’s creative process while also reflecting back on the album’s broader themes. In the interlude “Mestizaje,” an unnamed narrator speaks about the dangerous colorist racial ideology that has shaped her family and so many other Latin American ones, in which marriages with white partners are encouraged in order to produce “better-looking” children. Malegría succeeds, in part, because Reyna isn’t afraid to confront the ugly parts of Latin American culture, too.",Pop,7.7
335,"Skilled though he may be, J. Cole’s surprise mixtape makes good on its promise to negate its relevance in real time. Evidently, J. Cole is not the kind of rapper he would like to be. Since the beginning of his career at the peak of the blog era, the North Carolina native has staked his reputation on being an out-and-out, bar-for-bar rapper’s rapper, the model for the genre, the control in the experiment. Though a talented singer with a pliable voice, he’s always been reverent (sometimes to a fault) of legends from the 1990s and early 2000s, writing about his life in long, mythic arcs and dotting his albums with radio singles that are anchored by neuroses and character details seeded on his earliest mixtapes. He delivers all of this in a manner designed to clear space for determined bursts of setup-punchline showmanship—a magnetic mode if you can hack it. Cole often cannot.Might Delete Later, released as a “mixtape” without warning last week, exists solely to underline this competitive streak in Cole’s music. How else are we to receive a record that, in lieu of a single, took shaky aim at Kendrick Lamar, who had very lightly jabbed at Cole on Future and Metro Boomin’s “Like That” weeks before? But this past weekend, less than 48 hours after its release, Cole went on stage at his own Dreamville Festival in Raleigh and apologized to Kendrick for “7 Minute Drill” and its clot of repurposed Jay-Z bars and creaking metaphors (“Fly pebbles at your dome, we the Stone Temple Pilots”; “He still doing shows but fell off like the Simpsons”), calling it “the lamest shit I ever did in my fucking life.” Maybe! What’s certain is that Might Delete Later makes good on its dated title as a record that, for reasons apology-related and not, seems to negate itself in real time.Both would-be singles, “Fever” and the Bas-featuring “Stealth Mode,” feel like half a record abandoned before being rounded into its ideal shape. (The former is slinking and still mostly effective, especially after it recovers from a clumsy opening line that for a second recalls his infamous, room-clearing verse on Jeremih’s “Planez.”) Elsewhere, attempts at verbal pyrotechnics become indistinct: By the middle of “Huntin’ Wabbitz,” his flow has settled into a sleepy seesaw, and his boasts about being “too locked in” don’t read quite the way they’re intended.And still, Might Delete Later has plenty of compelling elements—rhythmic, textural, even personal. Opener “Pricey” is weighed down by an unnecessarily frilly interlude and equally strained references to John Gotti and Rick and Morty. But its drums sound like they’re dragging themselves through quicksand, and Cole darts nimbly through them. A track later, on “Crocodile Tearz,” he’s rapping through his teeth in a way that makes him sound more composed and more menacing than nearly ever before; “H.Y.B.” is an exceedingly rare thing, a subtle integration of drill’s wobble into a less industrial sound palette. On “Stickz N Stonez,” The Alchemist provides the sort of irresistible hop that forces rappers to snap upright and find new pockets.",Rap,5.1
336,"This domestic, stripped-down edition of Khruangbin has all the comforts of home, wherever in the world that may be. In 2020, at the height of the pandemic, Khruangbin released their third studio album, Mordechai, a disco-funk reprieve with the unusual, yet welcome, addition of vocals from bassist Laura Lee. Four years later, the trio returns with the stripped-down A LA SALA, a stark change in direction and scale from their last few albums. Khruangbin have always drawn inspiration from genres that span the globe and transport the listener to its far-flung corners. This time around, they squeeze all those influences into a universally beloved place: home.Woven together from collected pieces of unreleased recordings and beat loops, A LA SALA—which translates as “to the living room”—pulls the group back to their earliest days in Houston, where their early recordings were heavily inspired by ’70s psych rock and funk, embedded with modalities from Thailand to Niger. In the intervening years, Khruangbin have become a streaming behemoth and darling of the indie jam scene, which means there’s far less to prove. There is a lot less of everything in A LA SALA: less spacey synths, less vocals, and a less-is-more approach to their usual genre-bending approach. The band thrives when it sheds all of the frills, and creates a small world where anything is possible.Breathing room is the big draw here. If Mordechai exhibited too many moving parts to focus on any one moment or feeling, A LA SALA gently guides you through the ebbs and flows of varying moods and personalities. “Fifteen Fifty-Three” welcomes us like a late-night conversation, as if guitarist Mark Speer is relaying a story of a past life with each long-decaying strum. “Hold Me Up (Thank You)” begins as a familiar Khruangbin psych-funk workout until midway through, when a few sharp tugs of the guitar bring the song into a traditional Congolese soukous rhythm. All the while, the subtle vocal work shines in the background, allowing the instruments room to breathe.“Pon Pón” lives in a tropical paradise, transporting us to some oceanside boardwalk late in the afternoon with the sounds of old-school Brazilian funk and MPB. DJ Johnson’s deft, subtle drumming adds to the movement of the melody without distracting from the strings and soft vocals counting down in a variety of languages. The big standout is “Ada Jean,” a noirish composition anchored by Lee’s shadowy, suspicious bassline. As the song progresses, Speer’s fluttery guitar riffs soften the scene, which ends with the distant sounds of sirens and whimpers. Perhaps “Ada Jean” is an assassin who hit her mark and the weeper a bereaved loved one. Perhaps it’s a Wild West story of a bank robbery gone awry. Regardless, when the trio is humming like this, the catalog of mental imagery runs deep.",Rock,7.1
337,"The 17-year-old rapper-producer’s solo debut is pastel pretty in the Surf Gang tradition, coating pristine samples in a thin layer of digital grime. FearDorian beats are potent enough to leave you with a contact high. Their enveloping chaos feels structured, as if you synced playback on two completely different songs until they formed an alien vibe of their own. Like his stylistic forebears-turned-collaborators in Surf Gang—Dorian used to make dance videos set to the collective’s songs on Triller—rap, indie rock, and vaporwave are clear influences. Bending those sounds into different shapes and sizes is the 17-year-old rapper-producer’s default zone. This is a kid who’s sampled Amy Winehouse for a Milwaukee rap track, who pulls as much inspiration from Midwest emo records and James Ferraro as he does from Chicago rapper-producer Lucki. Take the droning guitars and booming trap drums that power Seattle rapper Ghoulaveli’s 2019 single “no!,” or how the addition of twinkling strings to the synthetic claps on AyooLii’s “Andele” makes it just a bit zanier. Dorian’s production reflects the borderless imagination of the postmodern rap internet while remaining solid enough to not dissolve in its own haze.After years of offering up beats to his growing network, Dorian uses them to tell his own story on FearDorian, his self-titled solo debut. Unlike AyooLii or Florida rapper 454, whose pitch-shifted chortles tend to hover above the beat, Dorian’s whispered croak is nonchalant, always on the verge of being consumed by its surroundings. Even when he’s grappling with the ennui that plagues every teenager, he doesn’t necessarily sound timid or unsure. Early highlight “Acrid Taste” fishtails through emotional heel turns: Out-of-body experiences at parties and fears of turning into his father give way to cheeky second-wind optimism (“I feel like I’m dyin’, I tell bro to pass the water”). But what stands out most isn’t the melancholy lyrics or the silky beat—a sample from a song by Philly shoegaze band They Are Gutting a Body of Water combined with tinny, blown-out 808s—it’s Dorian broadcasting from the epicenter.The songs on FearDorian aren’t as grandiose as the stadium-sized rock-rap of someone like Kenny Mason. They don’t fully fit the Hot Topic-by-way-of-Nike-tech aesthetic of evilgiane or Polo Perks either. Dorian’s percussion is warbly and busy but soft, more interested in setting a mood than inciting a mosh pit (not that that’s stopped anyone trying). The album’s harshest beat is “Raining in Brooklyn,” where chiptune-esque synths drape around thundering drums and non sequitur bars. Otherwise, the beats on FearDorian are post-Surf Gang wonders, pastel-pretty with just a touch of digital grime. Lead single “Highschool” pits skipping hi-hats against swelling keyboards, recalling SenseiATL’s work with Tony Shhnow if it were retrofitted into an HD remake of Nights Into Dreams, while “Virginia Hymn” suggests MexikoDro remixing Dirty Projectors.",Rap,7.4
338,"The debut EP from TikTok’s favorite teenage shoegazer includes breakout song “Your face” and other delicate acts of genre worship. No one can tear TikTok scrollers away from their cherished dust bunny shoegaze—not fatigue, not the U.S. Senate. Gen Z loves the ashen ’90s rock subgenre as dearly as a worn pair of Uggs, and through TikTok, they’ve helped facilitate its contemporary revival. But if every teen were suited to spreading the good word, there’d be fewer paintings of Joan of Arc. Not everyone can have the reach of 19-year-old Natalie Lu, known as Wisp, whose 2023 debut single “Your face” led to thousands of TikTok plays and, now, Interscope releasing her first EP, Pandora.For a while, “Your face” inspired people to post sullen slideshows demanding romance and videos lusting after pink supermarket cookies. The song, currently approaching 50 million Spotify streams, is a spring storm; its vocals sound soaked and distant like a lost dove or Deftones, and its guitar parts are made of chilled spiderwebs or Souvlaki. The months passed. Wisp assured fans that she was “a broke college student,” not an industry plant, and then she got signed. Now her TikTok and Instagram are full of shades of blue and angel wings—world-building for Pandora, which includes “Your face” and other delicate acts of shoegaze worship. But Pandora never becomes more interesting than that.So every song on Pandora expertly fries its wistful melodies and Lu’s breathy voice hangs over them like a snowdrop. “See you soon” starts with the sound of the whistling wind and ends with Lu swearing, “I’d give all the stars to see you soon.” It creaks and stings—it does feel good to listen to. The most attractive aspect of shoegaze is how it takes shiny, sexy things—sports car guitar riffs, thunderclap drums, Kazu Makino’s singing voice—and covers them in pond scum. The point of this sopping-wet distortion is to make you believe you have an anonymous valentine: You don’t need the glamor of rock’n’roll, because restraint is more impressive.But shapeless repetition… not so much. That’s the issue with a cotton-ball wall of sound like “Enough for you,” which follows “Your face” and is generally indistinguishable from it. Like the rest of Pandora, “Enough for you” floats on Lu’s windchime vocals and a loose guitar loop; it sounds like untwisting a Twizzler, and that’s about as deep as it goes. “Your eyes gaze into mine/But sparks don’t seem to fly,” Lu exhales like she’s sleep-talking. Another sweet nothing on an EP frosted with them.But what about the other things—the painful things, the rejection, the dark nights and sinister crows—that Wisp’s favorite references, bands like Have a Nice Life and Whirr, turn into unforgettable art? Pandora doesn’t touch them. The EP has a filter on, reusing only the prettiest parts of shoegaze without expanding on it. That’s the point of a lot of music on TikTok, to be fair—to luxuriate in evocation. It won’t progress a genre or your life, but few things do. No need to quit your daydream. There’s love in it, at least.",Rock,6.4
339,"Drawing freely from funk, gospel, African pop, and electronica, Ahmed Gallab’s exuberant new album rejoices in the power of Black diasporic identity and community. On his new album, Ahmed Gallab, the Sudanese-born, New York-based multi-instrumentalist behind Sinkane, embodies the sense of deep pain and great joy that powers the sound of Black liberation. From the earliest spirituals to the first civil rights songs, the uplifting power of gospel to the cathartic energy of funk, Black music resonates with this profound duality, serving as a fundamental tool of resistance—a loud, proud refusal to comply with the expectations of a world that seeks to oppress. On We Belong, Sinkane uphold this legacy, smashing through constraints with revolutionary exuberance. The fact that so many civil rights anthems remain as relevant today as they were in the 1960s could be cause for sorrow, but Gallab chooses to celebrate the beauty in the struggle—most of all, the role of community and togetherness in driving it forward.Sinkane’s albums all exude positivity, starting from the sunlit, breezy grooves of Mars (2012) and Mean Love (2014), which drew on Sudanese pop, ’70s funk, and electronica to give shape to the borderless sound that has come to define Sinkane. Gallab sharpened his focus on Life & Livin’ (2017), engaging more deeply with issues afflicting the world around him; on 2019’s Dépaysé, he explored his identity and the complexities of growing up as “an outsider” while reiterating messages of hope and unity. Thematically, then, We Belong is no great departure. Yet it feels grounded in a way that Sinkane’s previous albums were not, its joy less rooftop party, more radical and transformative. Opener “Come Together” lays out the core theme, urging those who feel they don’t belong to do just as the title suggests. “Greater than a sum of parts/There’s a better life to be,” Gallab belts over a swell of surging synths, as the word “Africa” rings out in a robotic drawl, transforming the track into a George Clinton-esque pan-African anthem.We Belong is Sinkane’s most collaborative album to date, welcoming luminaries like soul singer Bilal and the late jazz multi-instrumentalist Casey Benjamin. It especially draws on “a specific kind of Black musical community” centered around New York, Gallab said in a statement. Many of the featured vocalists, such as Ifedayo Gatling (of the Harlem Gospel Travelers), Tru Osborne, and STOUT, have roots in gospel. The title track, co-written by Gallab and Amanda Khiri, channels the transcendent joy of Black church music through call-and-response vocals and an earth-shattering performance by STOUT. Together, they offer up P-funk extravagance, a call to freedom, and a few words borrowed from Alexander Pope: “Be yourself, free your mind/To err is human/To forgive divine.”",Electronic,7.5
340,"The trio’s latest album proposes a distinctly South African brand of sophistipop, folding elements of amapiano, mbaqanga, and house into a breezy, wistful blend. There was an admission implicit in the title of the South African trio Beatenberg’s 2022 EP On the way to Beatenberg: The group had yet to arrive at a sound. Over 19 minutes, they experimented with baroque guitar and Auto-Tune; they flirted with EDM uplift and Balearic haze. But Beatenberg’s core remained indie pop, refracted through guitarist and lead singer Matthew Field’s lifelong love of maskandi and mbaqanga. Their serene rumbas can make the group’s music feel out of time, not just in America (where a dusty mental shelf might hold them alongside Dirty Projectors, Paul Simon, and Vampire Weekend) but also at home, where amapiano and its many varieties are the hot pop export. When Beatenberg dabble in dance, it’s generally to add Zulu folk flavor to someone else’s production. A decade ago, they collaborated with fellow countryman DJ Clock on the tropical-house smash “Pluto (I Remember You).” In 2021, Beatenburg popped up on RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE—the continent-spanning collaboration between producers Scorpion Kings and Tresor—to get pensive on the Afropiano song “Dust in the Wind.”“Dust in the Wind” appears, in reworked form and now titled “Worth More,” on The Great Fire of Beatenberg. Field’s guitars are pushed to the fore; the bass follows the chord changes instead of dictating them. It’s less a capeside DJ set than an afternoon party in a walled garden. The details are exquisitely rendered; the conversation is intimate but ends abruptly; outside noise wafts in but never threatens the proceedings. The result is a distinctly South African sophistipop, a guitar-centric companion piece to Nostalgia, the 2019 bubblegum-revival album from Tresor, the Congolese-born producer—and erstwhile Drake collaborator—who’s also an old friend of Field’s. (“Aphrodite,” Beatenberg’s Nostalgia contribution, is a typically cool affair, all electric piano slink and lilting devotion.)At the moment, the way to Beatenberg cuts through Field, whose playing is more central than ever. On the restless “Chorus of May,” he’s skipping between staves, chasing wholeness with blithe resignation. His diagonal solo powers down like a dying robot. On “Eau de Toilette,” he effortlessly interlocks with Beatenberg’s rhythm section—first bassist Ross Dorkin, then drummer Robin Brink—like a bike chain jumping between sprockets. “You sweat the right kind of sweat/Mixed with your eau de toilette/Impossible to forget,” he pants before unfurling a solo that sounds like a baying dog. Field’s timbral exercises prove infectious: The peacocking “Wheelbarrow” sways and bumps like its titular vehicle, as the band deploys percussive clangs and trapdoor echo. If Beatenberg doesn’t match the exuberance of prime mbaqanga here, they at least nail its strut.",Rock,7.2
341,"Dominic Maker and Kai Campos blaze another new path, but the genre vagabonds get a little lost in their sleek shoegaze post-rock album. Mount Kimbie are once again seeking transformation. Over the past 15 years, the UK duo of Dominic Maker and Kai Campos have swerved from post-dubstep to post-punk, techno to R&B, ambient garage to lo-fi pop, releasing DJ mixes and double albums, collaborating with James Blake and Jay-Z and King Krule and Travis Scott. Now they’re back with something slightly different: a gritty, shoegazy, post-rock album called The Sunset Violent. With help from new bandmembers Andrea Balency-Béarn and Marc Pell, Mount Kimbie dust off their guitars and turn up their distortion, hoping to become Stereolab for a new generation, an electro-rock outfit whose work is as familiar as it is obscure.The road to Mount Kimbie’s revised sound has been winding. As underground electronic producers in the early 2010s, Maker and Campos’ experimental flair punctuated otherwise minimalist compositions: a time-warped acoustic guitar behind glassy ambient pads, arhythmic drums around synth keys. Their most recent album, 2022’s MK 3.5: Die Cuts | City Planning, branched off into hazy R&B and hip-hop before morphing into muted, dubby club beats. Their defining work remains 2017’s Love What Survives, a new-age post-punk record heavy on overdriven guitars and grainy synths, a style well-suited to Maker and Compos’ habitual muffled abstraction.Sleeker and safer than its predecessor, The Sunset Violent similarly provides a sturdy backdrop of fuzzy guitar and Korgs for Balency-Béarn and Maker’s melancholic vocals. The newly constituted four-piece sounds like if Sonic Youth or Young Marble Giants were wizards with the DAW, a band whose songs play like richly detailed dreams whose meaning may leave you scratching your head.The strongest songs sparkle with a morose charm. On “Dumb Guitar” and “Shipwreck,” Balency-Béarn’s plainspoken singing wafts over murky lounge-pop, giving The Sunset Violent some much-needed friction. “Every day we’re eating out/Another date I’ll kill myself,” she deadpans on “Dumb Guitar.” Her wistful, unadorned voice is the closest thing the album has to an emotional center, especially with Maker playing the guileless sidekick role Oliver Sims perfected in the xx. It’s jarring to hear how much more alive King Krule’s baritone sounds on “Boxing” and “Empty and Silent,” how much defter his pen—a stunning feat for such a famed curmudgeon. Sometimes The Sunset Violent searches high and low for a pulse and just comes up empty.Maker’s at his most confident on the spectacular “Fishbrain,” a song that blisters with bitterness and regret. The writing is cryptic but sharp, featuring fractured lines about bridges falling and “running out of films” to watch. When Mount Kimbie align their songcraft with a tension, a feeling, a perspective—no matter how prosaic or subliminal—their songs soar. It’s when they languish in repetitive patterns and dry melodies, like on “Got Me” and the opening half of “A Figure in the Surf,” that they’re yanked back to earth.",Electronic,6.8
342,"The New York-based musician explores the nature of longing in a set of pieces that merge modular synthesis with Hindustani classical music. What does yearning sound like? A composer versed in Hindustani classical music might reach for Raga Bageshri, a melodic framework meant to stir longing for reunion with one’s lover. Bageshri dictates the melody of a slew of romantic film soundtracks, including “Aaja Re Pardesi,” theme to the mystical meet-cute amid the misty pines of northern India that opens the 1958 film Madhumati. Just like that film’s protagonist, electronic musician and vocalist Arushi Jain turned to Bageshri in a landscape filled with wildlife, using the raga to compose the nine tracks on her latest record in a makeshift studio on the shores of Long Island. What Jain yearns for on this record, however, is not a lover but an emotion. On Delight, Jain grasps for a joy that lies tantalizingly out of reach, bringing melodies informed by Raga Bageshri into dazzling contact with modular synthesis and digital manipulation.That’s no easy task, given the baggage of a genre whose history is centuries old. Attempts to mix Hindustani classical and electronic music date back to at least the late 1960s, as documented by an archival compilation and accompanying book assembled by Emptyset’s Paul Purgas and released last year. Indian musicologist Gita Sarabhai founded India’s first electronic music studio at the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad, in 1969 and experimented with marshaling the Moog to perform Hindustani scales. But Sarabhai was a purist, seeing in Western harmony a dangerous, alien influence on the traditions she was working to preserve in a state freshly liberated from colonial rule. Jain remains open to the possibilities of hybridity and cross-pollination, crafting her own sound in the space opened up by diaspora. Now, working with instrumentalists for the first time, she folds a bit of New York into her cascading, hybrid melodies.These compositions represent Jain at her most vibrant, coaxing a cornucopia of sounds out of a single raga. Effervescent samples from classical guitarist Ria Modak punctuate a sea of eddying electronics on “Still Dreaming”; MIZU’s aching cello line on “Exquisite Portraiture” morphs in and out of a midnight hum; flutist Annie Wu has a bright, reverb-soaked duet with Jain’s synth work over an understated, evolving rhythm on “Imagine an Orchestra.” Jain’s pointillistic sound-design techniques also add to the pleasure of Delight. An aquatic feel permeates “Our Touching Tongues,” where Payton MacDonald’s glittering marimba flows forward and in reverse. And Jain breaks her voice into grains of sound in “Infinite Delight,” creating microscopic textures even as she bends between microtones. If Under the Lilac Sky was drenched in sunset hues, Delight emanates iridescence through a diversity of electronic and acoustic textures.",Electronic,7.7
343,"On their second album since reforming in 2010, the UK’s once-notorious indie rockers settle into the congenial sound of a pretty good band. In Carol Reed’s classic film The Third Man, Orson Welles’ slippery anti-hero Harry Lime justifies his descent into criminality by comparing the cultural output of Renaissance Italy during the turbulent rule of the Borgia family with that of Switzerland. The Swiss, he concludes, “had brotherly love and they had 500 years of democracy and peace. And what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.” It is a reference that the Libertines, with their love of fading Albion, would surely appreciate, though perhaps not when directed at All Quiet on the Eastern Esplanade, their second album since reforming in 2010.During the Libertines’ first run, from 1997 to 2004, the band thrived on a perilous creative chaos, driven by the love/hate relationship between founding members and principal songwriters Carl Barât and Peter Doherty, plus London bus-loads of hard drugs. Unhealthy though it undoubtedly was —Doherty, famously, was jailed for burgling Barât’s flat and the pair needed bodyguards to keep themselves apart during the recording of their second album—this tension produced a thrilling, white-knuckle-scrape of a debut and a follow-up that intermittently sparked on its way to the top of the UK charts. In keeping with this tempestuous history, the band’s third album, 2015’s surprisingly vital Anthems for Doomed Youth, was “born of complexity,” according to Barât. This leaves All Quiet on the Eastern Esplanade as the first Libertines’ LP to spring untroubled onto wax.For anyone who grew up on the Libertines, it’s hard not to root for them. And yet initial signs here are far from promising. “Run Run Run”—the lead single that, ironically, is about trying to escape the past—uses the well-worn line “It’s my party and I’ll cry if I want to” within the first 30 seconds. Its meat-and-potatoes indie rock doesn’t get much more inspired from there: The line between a good Libertines song and a bad one remains perilously thin. “Night of the Hunter” goes a step further, filching not just its title (from Charles Laughton’s 1955 noir masterpiece) but also its central motif, in this case from Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake, a borrowing better left unheard. On “Oh Shit,” the Libertines rip off themselves with a spiraling guitar riff that’s a near copy of their 2003 single “Don’t Look Back Into the Sun.”What are the Libertines without their central tension? Not that different, perhaps, to the Britpop bands they followed into the charts or the legions of wannabes they inspired in the early 2000s, which is to say very much in the classic British rock lineage of the Kinks, the Jam, and the Smiths, albeit without the wistful beauty, artful fury, and naive experimentation of all three. There are moments on this album that speak to a band that once embraced its idiosyncrasies. “Baron’s Claw” has a touch of hot jazz in its sprawling trumpet lines, while “Be Young”’s excursion into reggae is interesting, if not entirely rewarding, helped by the fact that Gary Powell is one of indie rock’s smartest drummers.These points of interest are outweighed by a run of well-crafted but derivative indie-pop tunes where melodic smarts meet copybook songwriting. “Songs They Never Play on the Radio” borrows the title of a well-regarded 1992 biography of Nico and sets it to a swooning, downbeat melody, while “Man With the Melody” could be latter-period Blur with its twinkling strings, acoustic guitars, and craftily descending, Albarn-esque melody. It’s a perfect illustration of All Quiet on the Eastern Esplanade’s central conundrum: The Libertines may be running low on originality, but they can still produce a strong tune when the muse strikes.This album is no Renaissance masterpiece, then. But it’s not quite Harry Lime’s cuckoo clock either. Stripped of their fraternal bad blood, the Libertines are just a band—and a decent one at that. But, as All Quiet on the Eastern Esplanade chugs to its chummy finale, you do almost wish that someone would start burgling someone, if only to see what happens.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

344,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit TLC’s classic second album, whose unapologetic femininity and low-key swagger made it a landmark of pop, R&B, and hip-hop. The original concept for CrazySexyCool was simple: Women contain multitudes. The title, an amalgamation of their personalities, was a way to subvert the public’s perception of each member: Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins as the “cool” one, Rozonda “Chilli” Thomas as the “sexy” seducer, and Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes herself supposedly “crazy.” She figured, rightfully, that each of them was all of those things at once. Straightforward enough—and yet some of the album’s male producers initially missed the point about the self as a many-layered construct. “They’d do a crazy song for me, a sexy song for Chilli, and a cool song for Tionne,” Left Eye told Vibe in 1994. “We had to explain that CrazySexyCool doesn’t just describe us individually. It describes all the parts of every woman.”Each member of the Atlanta R&B trio had a distinct role, but the point was how they all came together. T-Boz was raspy and matter-of-fact, her jazz-like vocal style centering tone and swagger over power and clarity. Chilli was the closest to traditional R&B, imbuing their songs with quiet-storm sultriness. Left Eye was the rebellious poet who rapped, sang, and came up with many of their musical and visual concepts.It was Left Eye who suggested the group pin condoms to their clothing and tape them over her own eyeglasses to promote safe sex, a laudable fashion statement that came to define their anything-goes credo as artists. As with their predecessors Salt-N-Pepa, none of TLC’s messaging in their songs, visuals, or outfits seemed scripted or telegraphed. Unlike in the typical girl group, no one member was ever elevated over another. Their individual styles merged seamlessly because they played off each other’s strengths, making the whole greater than the sum of its parts.Their 1992 debut album, Ooooooohhh... on the TLC Tip, presented the trio as sexual and independent twentysomething women who allowed themselves to be goofy, improper, and a little bit messy on their own terms. The critical success and triple-platinum sales of that album positioned TLC as role models for younger listeners and pop industry anarchists who pushed the fundamental truth that women have basic physical needs. In the video for “Ain’t 2 Proud 2 Beg,” they fired water guns and sang about sexual autonomy while sporting bright, baggy jumpsuits and kooky Digital Underground-style puffy hats, making the case for sexual expression without suppression.CrazySexyCool was slicker and more scandalous, smoothing out TLC’s approach without losing the tongue-in-cheek wit of the debut. Its songs emphasize not just sex but pleasure in all its many forms. It’s a liberating, multifaceted view that suggests sexy doesn’t have to be raunchy or explicit alone: It can manifest itself in the movement of a serpentine sax, or the way T-Boz whispers, simply, “Yes, it’s me again” at the beginning of “Creep” like it’s foreplay.",Pop,9.3
345,"The Syrian dabke icon’s latest album is slicker and less varied than his earlier releases, but its breakneck rhythms and euphoric synths still pack a joyful punch. It’s been a turbulent few years for dabke-techno king Omar Souleyman. In 2021 the Syrian singer was arrested in Urfa, the city in southeastern Turkey where he had been living and running a bakery since escaping Syria’s civil war in 2011. Accused of being a member of the Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) militia, which authorities in Ankara consider a terrorist organization and an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), Souleyman was held for a little over 24 hours before being released without charges.Aside from touching on themes of exile on recent albums, Souleyman’s music has never been overtly political (a choice that has sometimes drawn criticism from fellow Syrians). But growing up as a Sunni Arab in Syria’s culturally diverse al-Hasakah region, he absorbed Kurdish, Assyrian, and even Turkish and Iraqi influences, often singing in Kurdish and collaborating with Kurdish artists, such as his former longtime keyboard player Rizan Sa’id. Since leaving Turkey after his arrest, Souleyman has found a new home in Erbil, the capital of Iraq’s Kurdish Region, and it is to this ancient city—which, in contrast to the repressive regime in Turkey, offered him solace amid its diverse cultural milieu—that he dedicates his fifth studio album.Erbil, his third full-length for Diplo’s Mad Decent (and one of over 500 albums overall, if you believe the lore), celebrates the new experiences and friendships that Souleyman encountered there. For non-Arabic speakers that’s hard to know, because the label supplies no lyrics or translations—a notable omission, considering Souleyman’s international audience. But in a way this follows the same patterns that have characterized his trajectory since he was first plucked from relative obscurity in Syria and presented to the rest of the world. For many, Souleyman may be the only dabke artist they ever come across. Decontextualized and inscrutable behind his dark sunglasses, he projects an aura of unknowability and distance.Since Souleyman’s international breakthrough in 2007 with Sublime Frequencies’ compilation Highway to Hassake, he’s amassed hundreds of millions of YouTube views and become the face of dabke in the Western world, collaborating with a varied bunch of artists, from Björk to Gorillaz and Four Tet. On Erbil, he sticks to the time-tested formula that has propelled him thus far: his emotion-filled baritone gliding over a cascade of whirling saz lines, (mostly) electronic simulations of instruments such as oud, mijwiz, and arghul, and rock-solid, trance-inducing beats.",Experimental,6.7
346,"Twelve albums in, the duo enlists Beck to help synthesize their many interests into a record that feels lively, fresh, and colorful. Like many couples in a long-term relationship, the Black Keys decided to look outside their union for inspiration when it came time to record Ohio Players, the band’s twelfth album. No strangers to extracurricular collaborations—guitarist/vocalist Dan Auerbach practically lives at his Easy Eye Sound, producing records for Robert Finley, Hermanos Gutiérrez, Marcus King, Early James, and Shannon and the Clams in the last few years—the band hasn’t brought additional musicians into the studio since reviving their partnership in 2019 with “Let’s Rock”, a back-to-basics platter that seemed to reject the psychedelic haze engulfing 2014’s Turn Blue.Turn Blue, like so many of the albums the Black Keys released on Nonesuch between 2008 and 2014, was co-produced by Danger Mouse, a collaborator who helped Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney move far beyond the band’s grimy garage-blues roots. After working with Danger Mouse, the Black Keys prized production—the tactical, physical sound of a record—as much as the song itself, an aesthetic that carries through to Ohio Players. Pointedly avoiding the expansive exploration of their Obama-era albums, the Black Keys instead rely on the bag of tricks they’ve developed over their career intent on creating interesting juxtapositions from familiar sounds.Sonically speaking, there’s nothing about Ohio Players that feels unexpected. It’s a bustling concoction of fuzz-speckled riffs, funky rhythms, sweet harmonies, tart hooks, and spectral keyboards, the kinds of refurbished retro-rock that are not only the band’s stock in trade but Auerbach’s signature as a producer. Even the presence of rappers Lil Noid and Juicy J on “Candy and Her Friends” and “Paper Crown” recalls Blakroc, the duo’s 2009 excursion into rap-rock, yet the fact that Black Keys have explicitly carved space for hip-hop on Ohio Players goes a long way in explaining why the album doesn’t feel like a retread. Instead of siloing their interests, the group synthesizes them, making a record that feels lively, fresh, and colorful.To that end, Beck is the crucial collaborator on Ohio Players. Half of the album’s fourteen songs bear a Beck co-writing credit and his presence is felt throughout, whether it’s his lead vocals on “Paper Crown” or how the very sound of the record is pitched halfway between the dense collage of Odelay and the vibrant neo-soul of Midnite Vultures. The Black Keys may follow Beck’s genre-bending lead—the lithe “Candy and Her Friends” bears his imprint but it’s the only song Auerbach and Carney wrote on their own—but they never give the impression of an ironic distance. There’s a reason why a sumptuous cover of William Bell’s slow-burning Stax classic “I Forgot to Be Your Lover” resides smack dab in the middle of Ohio Players: Underneath all the stylish clamor, the Black Keys remain anchored in classic soul.",Rock,7.2
347,"Nearly a decade into their reunion, the shoegaze titans refuse to pander to fans clamoring for their classic sound. Their stubbornness is admirable—if occasionally frustrating. Nine years and three albums into their reunion, Ride refuse to pander to their classic sound. Their stance is frustratingly laudable—a creative obstinacy to be admired with a slightly heavy heart. The Oxford band may not have invented the shoegaze palette of swirling guitars and dreamy vocals, but in the early 1990s, when the genre first started to take hold, Ride were the shoegaze poster boys, their sharp songs and good looks taking the Thames Valley sound to the upper reaches of the UK charts. And if Slowdive have surpassed them in popularity post-reformation, you can still hear the vaporous drive of Ride’s debut album, Nowhere, in the music of nu-gaze bands from Hotline TNT to For Tracy Hyde.The Shoegaze Revival Hit Its Stride in 2023Ironically, the shoegaze revivalists often sound considerably more attached to classic Ride than Ride themselves do these days. The band’s first post-reunion album, Weather Diaries, bore distinctly modern production touches, while 2019’s This Is Not a Safe Place was a broad-ranging church that encompassed electro pop and acoustic jangle in its eclectic sweep. The group has framed Interplay as the album that brings it all together, uniting the different sides of the Ride narrative. But it’s not really Ride enough for that—more the sound of a band trying on different styles to see what fits, hindered by some mediocre songwriting.Ride, at their classic best, married haunting vocal harmonies to pillowing walls of guitar, like the Byrds via My Bloody Valentine. But distorted guitar is missing from most of Interplay, and its absence is felt more keenly than at any point since the group’s reunion. Instead, the unexpected sound that hangs heavily over the opening half of the album is that of New Order. “Last Frontier” is the spitting image of Manchester’s favorite sons in their rocking mode—Peter Hook-style I’m-in-control-here-lads bassline and all—while the chiming guitar and simple synth chords on “Monaco” (which even shares a name with a Hook side project) hold a mirror up to New Order at their ’90s glossiest.Interplay is not, then, the work of a group unduly concerned with fan service. Instead, the album continues in the liberated lineage of This Is Not a Safe Place, where a reunited band free of the crushing strain of legend status gets on with doing whatever the hell it likes—see also the Jesus and Mary Chain’s happily all-over-the-place 2024 album Glasgow Eyes. As on Weather Effect, the odd modern production effect sneaks through, such as the filtered fusion of French touch and shoegaze on “Peace Sign,” along with the psychedelic guitar whimsy (the charming “Last Night I Went Somewhere To Dream”) and dreamy acoustic strum (“Stay Free”) that their two previous albums did well.The 50 Best Shoegaze Albums of All TimeThe album also goes way further out into the weeds. “Sunrise Chaser” is a glittery wink away from being a disco record, with its funk bassline and what sounds like a Nile Rodgers-style guitar chuck; “I Came to See the Wreck” is kindergarten Depeche Mode with none of Dave Gahan’s pervy intensity; and the shuffling breakbeat and cinematic guitar effects of “Essaouira” suggest the trip-hop acts that followed Ride into the charts three decades ago.",Rock,6.2
348,"On his fourth album, the French producer plunges headfirst into camp, embracing overdriven synth-pop and vintage rock’n’roll. In the beginning, Gesaffelstein exuded cool. His synths oozed menace; his German-sounding alias was steeped in the perfume of Teutonic techno cred. Like Rick Owens’ slouchy draping, the French producer’s shadowy, slo-mo techno felt elegantly seedy, like a runway show in a back alley. But success has a way of defanging danger. After his work on Kanye West’s Yeezus boosted his profile, Gesaffelstein’s sophomore album, 2019’s Hyperion, came front-loaded with features like Pharrell, the sort of A-list cosign that the industry requires of a rising star. The louche swagger stumbled.It’s hard to stick to your dungeon-techno guns with Haim on the track; it’s hard to remain stone-faced with the Weeknd singing about fucking with the lights on. Where Gesaffelstein’s debut felt effortless, Hyperion scanned like the work of a guy who was trying too hard to fit in at the big kids’ table. (Turned out Gesaffelstein, real name Mike Lévy, was not immune to corniness: His alias was meant to shoehorn “Gesamtkunstwerk” into “Einstein,” as in Alfred—overstuffed references stretched by juvenile overreach into the portentous portmanteau.)GAMMA, then, comes as a happy surprise. Instead of trying to be cool, Gesaffelstein has plunged headfirst into camp. Glowering, industrial-grade techno is largely a thing of the past. In its place, he gives us a winking amalgam of overdriven synth-pop and vintage rock’n’roll. Seventies electro-punks Suicide and their French contemporaries Doctor Mix & the Remix, as well as synthabilly acolytes like the Jesus and Mary Chain and Love and Rockets, are obvious influences on Gesaffelstein’s distorted circuits, throbbing arpeggios, and motorik grooves. Lévy’s analog-rooted sound design has always been one of his strong points, and his synths have never buzzed as vigorously as they do here. Filters howl, lasers zap, and distortion builds like a tea kettle about to blow. The whole album’s a riot of squelch and clang.Depeche Mode—an act that knows a thing or two about turning high camp into stadium-filling pop music—cast an even longer shadow. That’s thanks in part to the Some Great Reward-esque accents that litter the record like so many tarnished lug nuts, glassy FM tones suggesting the steely clank of chains. (Idea for a great safe word: “Yamaha DX7.”) But it’s due even more to singer Yan Wagner, GAMMA’s lone vocalist, whose oily baritone lubricates six of the record’s 11 tracks. In “Hard Dreams,” his leering, bluesy singsong sounds like an armored-up homage to Dave Gahan at his leather-trousered toughest. In “The Perfect,” which does for AI what “Behind the Wheel” did for B&D, he actually sings the phrase “behind the wheel.” Much of the Depeche Mode worship is equally Lévy’s doing: The instrumental “Tyranny” taps into the same 6/8 shuffle that “Personal Jesus” borrowed from T. Rex.",Pop,7.2
349,"On their masterfully knotty fifth album, Vampire Weekend go on a self-mythological journey into old sounds, old haunts, and old cities to find something new within. Ezra Koenig begins Only God Was Above Us speaking, it seems, to just one person. Against a blur of amplifier hum and a tentative guitar strum, he sounds thin and reedy, almost petulant, a little bit doomy. “‘Fuck the world,’” Koenig sings softly, “You said it quiet/No one could hear you/No one but me.”This hushed distortion opens Vampire Weekend’s fifth album, where Koenig and his bandmates, Chrises Baio and Tomson, gaze longingly at the past to find more questions than answers. A chief concern is history, and where to fit within it, but, ultimately, Vampire Weekend itself is the focus of Only God Was Above Us. It is the band’s most overtly self-referential release, a collage of signature sounds and motifs dotted with allusions. It feels new and comfortable, regularly elegant and charming, calm and comforting, and, at times, foreboding. And just a bit worried.This is to say that Only God Was Above Us is also the most honest album Vampire Weekend have made, an encapsulation of what the band does best, melodic and abstruse in Koenig’s own masterful way. Take the two obvious callbacks on “Connect,” which recreates Tomson’s “Mansard Roof” drum fill and fits in keyboards that call to mind Contra’s runaway hit “Holiday.” The song is a lively reverie about lost days in New York, but slightly askew in its memories and mood. Koenig and co-producer Ariel Rechtshaid capture the strangeness with a track that takes the signature Vampire Weekend sounds and twists them to be a little jazzy, sometimes a little electronic, a beat away from melting down entirely. The result is something like indie deja vu, the sense that we’ve heard this before but can’t at all place it.Though the band members themselves have long lived in Los Angeles, New York still looms large for Vampire Weekend. Koenig, Baio, and Tomson all grew up in or around the city and, with ex-bandmate but current contributor Rostam Batmanglij, famously coalesced at Columbia University. Being away from New York, however, offers a new perspective: From a distance, the city appears as a decaying giant, inescapably beholden to its past and all the ghosts who’ve passed through. Simply by naming New Yorkers of old—the late Russian-born journalists Henry and Ludmilla Nikitina Shapiro, their daughter, Irina Shapiro Corten, the famed gallery owner Mary Boone, even a defunct tie shop—Koenig’s always-vibrant world of name-drops observes the strangeness of living in vast shadows.",Rock,8.6
350,"The Colombian superstar’s first Spanish-only album in 19 years is a brutally honest look at her breakup that overflows with vengeance and still-got-it sex appeal. With Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, her first album almost entirely in Spanish since 2005, Shakira signals a deliberate and timely return to her roots. When the Barranquilla native catapulted into the Anglophone pop scene with Laundry Service in 2001, she modeled a version of bilingual international stardom that opened doors for other Latine singers. Today, a new generation of Spanish-speaking stars like Bad Bunny, Rosalía, and Karol G have helped loosen the English language’s long-held grip on commercial pop. And while Shakira has always preached that music transcends language, her new album—saturated with bold-name cameos and dabbling in trending sounds—is poised to ride the latest wave.But you’re probably here to hear about her divorce. Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran obsesses over the demise of Shakira’s 11-year relationship with Gerard Piqué, the former Spanish soccer player she now calls “Voldemort.” The album title originates from a lyric in the standout “Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol.53,” the diss track originally recorded for Argentine DJ Bizarrap’s popular video series, and Shakira’s first all-Spanish song to reach the Hot 100. More than a year later, her digs still sting, from belittling her ex as a rookie to comparing his new girlfriend to a Twingo. Even when she’s not saying Piqué’s name, she kind of is: Imaginative, shady wordplay like “Yo solo hago música, perdón que te salpique” (roughly, “I only make music, sorry if it bothers you”) turned the song into a viral sensation. Then there’s the Kill Bill moment when Shakira reveals her intentions for this track, and perhaps to some extent, this album: “Esto es pa’ que te mortifique’/Mastique’ y trague’, trague’ y mastique’” (“This is for you to be mortified/To chew and swallow, swallow and chew”). Beneath her visceral rage is the heartbroken lover who simply wants to hurt her ex like he hurt her, to guarantee this record follows him forever.Breakups are hard, and the balance of the album offers a brutally honest glimpse into the aftermath. With her personal business already in the press, Shakira sings through the stages of grief, notably focusing on acceptance—as defined by vengeance and still-got-it sex appeal. The saga begins as a fantasy on flirty nu-disco opener “Puntería,” with Cardi B, where women are goddesses and men are horny centaurs with washboard abs. Bizarrap appears again on the squelchy electro-pop track “La Fuerte,” which pulses with 2 a.m. club heat as a post-breakup Shaki seeks refuge on the dancefloor. But as the chorus swells and the tempo quickens, it sounds as if she’s on the brink of calling her ex. “Dime dónde, cuándo y cómo,” she repeats (“Tell me where, when, and how”), her voice breaking into the high-pitched plea of romantic anguish that first defined Shakira’s music—good thing she deleted his number.",Pop,7.0
351,"The inimitable auteur’s latest record shows why he’s become the godfather of underground rap, and someone who’s still finding ways to tweak what he’s already perfected. On September 3, 2021, Montreal producer Nicholas Craven set a specific corner of Rap Twitter on fire. Drake had released Certified Lover Boy that day, a mostly forgettable collection save for its opener, “Champagne Poetry.” Instead of the tinny, trap-adjacent drums he typically favored, an unadorned, syncopated upright bass provided the rhythmic backbone of the track’s first half. It switched to a soul loop in the second, the low end slightly enhanced to keep the pulse intact. The lyrics were typical Drake fare, but he was in his technician bag, flirting with complex rhyme schemes. He’d carry them for several bars at a time, only to pull them apart carefully, as if curious how they fit together in the first place. This all sounded very familiar to a certain subsection of rap fans, including Craven, who tweeted, “Roc Marciano is the direct reason ‘Champagne Poetry’ exists.”If you scan through Reddit threads, YouTube comments, and tenth-anniversary retrospectives, you’ll find loose consensus that Marcberg, Marci’s 2010 solo debut, laid the groundwork for much of today’s rap underground. By the late aughts, focus had shifted away from the gritty Golden Era New York sound in favor of animated Atlanta trap and humid Texas funk. Contrary to the zeitgeist, Marcberg traded in frayed, ashen sonics, referencing and updating the bleak winter menace of East Coast classics like Mobb Deep’s Hell on Earth and Big L’s Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous.The Long Island rapper-producer’s dusty, claustrophobic sound owed a lot to ’90s forebears like the RZA and 4th Disciple, but it felt more thoughtfully modern than hollow throwback. Marci slowed tempos to a crawl and stripped his samples of anything superfluous—sometimes forgoing drums altogether—and rapped in gravelly, menacing monotone. Arguably, groups like Griselda and the Umbrella Collective, or scenes like the Lynn, Massachusetts universe surrounding Estee Nack and al.divino, wouldn’t exist without the diligent study of his catalog. To hear Marci’s minimalism mimicked by the biggest rapper in the world, a man known for echoing innovations by those levels below, meant Marci had transcended. His latest album, Marciology, is the most overt recognition of his living legend status. The title casts it as a text to pour over: This is Roc Marciano the inimitable auteur, still finding ways to tweak what he’s already perfected.As a producer, Marci wields minor-key loops like a hypnotist’s pocket watch, intensifying the trancelike groove with each repetition. Marciology features some of his outright trippiest work, sounding ripped from the soundtracks of obscure European heist films. Marci’s clearly inspired by the opulent spaciousness The Alchemist supplied for their 2022 collaboration, The Elephant Man’s Bones, but intent on deepening the mushroomy experimentation of 2020’s Mt. Marci. He helms ten of the album’s 14 tracks, crafting an unsettling psychedelic atmosphere; everything feels as off-kilter as a salvia breakthrough, recognizably part of Marci’s palette, but decisively weirder.",Rap,8.1
352,"The Minneapolis trio’s second album is a thrilling smash and grab, packed with catchy hooks, brat-punk impishness, and irresistible gang choruses. If Olivia Rodrigo ever played the dive bar circuit, then VIAL should be first in line as her tour opener. After forming in high school, the Minneapolis trio has spent the past five years honing its brat-punk sound and getting drunk on the thrill of songwriting as a diaristic purge. VIAL write up-front songs about abortion rights, trying to make friends, and, like any upstanding band that takes pride in its Midwestern roots, soup. No matter the subject, they sound jittery and giggly, like they’re kicking notes to each other in class and trying not to let the squeak of their Dr. Martens oxfords rat them out. Though the trio’s core is punk, they soften their edges with an alt-pop streak that sweetens their revenge songs, much like Rodrigo’s “bad idea right?” or “all-american bitch.”The band’s second album, burnout, dances its way through aggression and impishness. For every song about no longer recognizing yourself or overcoming a breakup, there’s another about stealing Honda Civics or chronic illness flare-ups. The more melodrama, the better. “ur dad” goes for a gender-swapped “Stacy’s Mom” in the punchy style of the B-52’s, while “friendship bracelet” recounts the downfall of two BFFs with the panache of Be Your Own Pet. You can hear a smile creep on bassist Taylor Kraemer’s face as she puts on her squeakiest voice for a gossipy skirmish on the same song. When guitarist KT Branscom’s pleas to go home morph into a howl on “apathy,” they sustain the note as if a full moon had risen into view. VIAL never sound more present, though, than when plotting revenge. “I hope you trip over your laces and fall on both your faces,” Branscom snarks on album opener “two-faced,” like they can already envision it happening.The best one-two punch of VIAL’s tongue-in-cheek songwriting arrives midway through burnout. Their tradition of airing out therapy woes through song continues here, after 2019’s “Therapy” and 2021’s “Therapy Pt II.” The third installment of this series is a 40-second tape recording in which drummer Katie Fischer and Branscom act out the beginning of a session to set up “just fine,” the album’s catchiest single. That twofer starts off in jest, but nose-dives into serious venting, with the chorus of “just fine” revolving around a depressive neutrality: “I don’t want to feel good or even happy anymore/I’m quite content with fine.” Branscom’s emotional deflation spirals out of control further when they repeat the phrase “I’m fine” so many times that the words distort with the same intent to lose meaning—and, in flashes, with a similar vocal tone—as Mitski’s “Nobody.” But Fischer’s drumming and Kraemer’s springy bassline keep things jovial, almost mockingly so, with rhythms so upbeat that fans demanded a ska version with former tourmate JER. Zoomed out, “just fine” represents VIAL’s evolution from DIY house show staple to underground TikTok darlings: punk drumming, melodic guitar, and youthful gang choruses that channel Gen Z’s coming-of-age angst.",Rock,7.4
353,"Ill-starred and long overlooked, the Detroit shoegaze band finally gets its due with a new Numero Group compilation. In 1994, shortly after most of their musical dreams collapsed, Majesty Crush played a show opening for alt-rockers Belly. After seeing them perform, lead singer Tanya Donelly pulled aside the band’s bassist and told him point blank, “I think everyone in your band needs therapy.”The bitter comedy in Donelly’s observation wasn’t that Majesty Crush had hit a low point; she had simply noticed the askew intensity that kept them going. An American shoegaze band that merrily sang about wanting to assassinate politicians and be debased like an animal while crafting tunes just as dreamy and gorgeous as their UK peers, Majesty Crush were upfront with their desires to the point of repulsion. Butterflies Don’t Go Away, Numero Group’s new compilation of the band’s only album and few EPs, explores this tension: a melding of the unsavory and sweet, raw lust and desire amplified tenfold by tense basslines and waves of pillowy distortion. It would have been enough to send them far beyond the Midwest and on to bigger things—if only anything, internally and externally, had gone right.Majesty Crush originated in Detroit at the dawn of 1990. The start of a new decade had brought the end of Spahn Ranch, a sparse, gothic post-punk band featuring Odell Nails III and aspiring music journalist Hobey Echlin. Itching to start a new band, Nails turned to his roommate and high school friend, David Stroughter. The duo turned back to Echlin to be their bassist. Michael Segal, a local record store clerk who had introduced Stroughter and Nails to A.R. Kane’s 69, completed the lineup on guitar. A.R. Kane’s album would become the new band’s Rosetta Stone: evidence for how to make noisy, echo-filled songs about deeply intimate desires, as well as how being Black did not exclude you from making such music.By 1992 Majesty Crush had begun to self-release singles and rise in the Detroit scene, powered in part by Stroughter’s stark intensity on stage and the band’s unwillingness to be confined by genre. Dali, an Elektra subsidiary, came calling; before 1993 even started, the band was making plans to record its debut. That record, Love 15, is presented here in full and stands as one of the most unheralded shoegaze albums of the ’90s. Opener “Boyfriend” is a sly wink: Its plumbing cymbal crashes and jet-engine guitar squall invoke the overwhelming barrage of other albums of the era before giving way almost immediately, opening up to real song, full of gliding guitar notes and Stroughter’s roughly sultry vocals about how he’s going to take another man’s girlfriend and make him squirm while he does it. Not that the band was afraid to be loud. “Seles” and “Grow” are beyond generous with the feedback, all the better to accent the unfettered debauchery within both. Still, there were few dream-pop bands of the time who could produce something like “Penny for Love”: easily the catchiest song the band ever wrote, with a rhythmic energy as infectious as the singing, even if Stroughter is talking about selling his body so he can buy time with someone else’s.",Rock,8.0
354,"Three decades into her career, Sheryl Crow is arguably a genre unto herself. Her new album sometimes makes her singular appeal feel generic. By the time Sheryl Crow’s 1996 self-titled album went triple platinum, she was a staple of cross-country road trips and 35-minute commutes. Her career is arguably the definitive crossover success of that decade—the rare safe bet for multiple radio formats, as pop as she is rock’n’roll, arguably a genre unto herself. Still, like other artists of her generation, Crow’s influence waned as CD players started to disappear from cars. Citing the pressures of the streaming economy, along with a growing family, she claimed that 2019’s Threads, her star-studded duets album, would be her last full-length LP. Then, over the past few years, she recorded enough singles to release a whole new album—a classic songwriter’s happy accident.If there’s a noteworthy evolution to Evolution, it’s that Crow decided to give up her role as a producer on her music. “There’s a point where you get tired of what you do, you recognize your tricks, you despair of them,” she said in a press release. She’s handed the reins off to super-producer Mike Elizondo, the guy who, depending on who you ask, elevated “In Da Club” to greatness or yanked Extraordinary Machine down from it. (He also, some 10 years ago, played bass in Crow’s band.) Here his pop sensibilities are utilitarian, pushing the songs to radio-friendly completion without getting in the way of Crow’s hallmarks; there’s still plenty of funky guitar hooks and live percussion, even if Crow’s voice is occasionally overproduced.When you remember that most of Evolution’s songs were intended as standalone singles, they do start to resemble archetypes of the Sheryl Crow playbook. You want the churning blues-rock number fit for a Chevy Silverado ad? Check out “Do It Again.” What about the rhythmic blend of acoustic guitar, bass, and handclaps that’ll work for both a campfire singalong and a festival encore? “Love Life” is your guy. Crow is, to her credit, tongue-in-cheek about her SoCal sensibilities. On opener “Alarm Clock,” she crafts an elaborate dream sequence, poking fun at how one might imagine an average day in the life of Sheryl Crow: blowing off work, flirting with Hollywood bartenders that look “like Chalamet,” cruising down to Malibu. It’s fun and frothy and has the best lyric about a surfboard since “Drunk in Love.”Crow’s songs have long described self-proclaimed gurus with a raised eyebrow, but three decades into her career, she seems more comfortable being the one to dish out wisdom. She does shrooms now, apparently, but the soul-searching is digestible, on the level of a microdose rather than ego death. One too many of these motivational uplifts drag Evolution into monotony—“You Can’t Change the Weather” and “Waiting in the Wings” may as well be the same song—and her attempt at broad social commentary, on “Where?”, doesn’t fare much better. And then there’s the entirely out-of-place Peter Gabriel cover “Digging in the Dirt,” surely a Threads cast-off, that inexplicably shows up on the deluxe version.",Rock,6.0
355,"Ishmael Butler assembles a crew of interstellar rap voyagers on a brief, echoey mixtape you might expect to find floating amid the space debris of an Afrofuturist universe. As early as their self-titled 2009 EP, and plenty times since, Shabazz Palaces’ songs have orbited the voice of Ishmael Butler, a smooth, droning instrument in a sea of organic and digital rhythms. It doesn’t matter whether he’s delivering old-school flexes or embodying an astral traveler; Butler’s voice is Shabazz’s center of gravity. Starting from the Quazarz double album in 2017, his raps became more shamanistic, sinking deeper into increasingly airy and synthetic beats. On last year’s Robed in Rareness, reverb and creative mixing made it seem like Butler was phasing through dimensions any time he opened his mouth. His latest record, Exotic Birds of Prey, amplifies that feeling—it’s a mixtape you might expect to find floating amid the space debris of an Afrofuturist universe akin to Saul Williams’ sci-fi musical Neptune Frost.Butler’s presence is still grounding, but on Exotic Birds of Prey his performances are noticeably more weightless. No longer tethered by the mbira and percussion of frequent collaborator Tendai Maraire—who left sometime around 2020’s The Don of Diamond Dreams—he sounds permanently disembodied. He’s whispering in your ear from another plane, when he’s speaking at all. On “Exotic BOP,” his verse and ad-libs waft like smoke around drums, synthetic chirps, and the more tactile melodies of guest Purple Tape Nate. Butler raps the least he ever has on a Shabazz project; he lets his electro-funk trips breathe, keeping the bars to a minimum and ceding space to guests.The spacey vibe remains intact even as Butler drifts away. His only contribution to lead single “Angela” is its rolling drum break and skittering synth patterns, which back up Dust Moth singer Irene Barber and longtime collaborator Stas Thee Boss as they unspool thoughts on urgency and Black power, respectively. The only song that doesn’t achieve lift-off is “Well Known Nobody,” a one-minute burst of spiky electric guitar and distortion; it sticks out on a tape otherwise committed to seamless blending. Still, Birds is an elegant and subtle display of Shabazz’s increasingly interstellar range, Butler’s raps providing flavor and body to the rest of the ensemble.Like its predecessor Robed in Rareness, Exotic Birds of Prey is a more free-wheeling offering from Shabazz. It feels more curatorial than any prior Shabazz project, too, a position seemingly confirmed by penultimate track “Synth Dirt.” Here, Butler—voice still reverberating from the shadows—casts himself as a DJ introducing a grip of artists on a broadcast that could be beaming from his home in Seattle, or from the Crab Nebula. As the geometric tones of closer “Take Me to Your Leader” blip and fold into themselves, it becomes clear that, short as it is, Exotic Birds of Prey still has the loose and expansive feel of a radio show. There’s no easier way to visit outer space.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

356,"The Australian DJ made her name with crowd-pleasing house anthems full of cheeky basslines and pop immediacy, but her debut LP aims for sophistication over quirkiness. Logic1000’s breakthrough track “DJ Logic Please Forgive Me” is a clever idea well executed. An archly titled edit of an already famous song, it kicks in with the chorus of Deborah Cox’s much-sampled “It’s Over Now” before dropping the kind of cheeky bassline that can send a small club in an English university town into pint-chucking meltdown. Yet these qualities—pop immediacy, winking humour, brash confidence—are in low supply on Logic1000’s first full-length, which aims for sophistication over quirkiness and ends up adrift from both.Samantha Poulter’s musical journey since her debut has been one of increasing focus—or, perhaps, a steady narrowing of parameters. On her debut EP, along with that ’90s R&B flip (dubbed “one of the big tracks of 2019” by Four Tet), Poulter tooled around with the easy touch of the Zen-minded beginner, exploring the hinterland between reggaeton and 2-step, shaken-up Middle Eastern drums, even stripping out rhythms to expose negative dubspace. But by 2021’s In the Sweetness of You EP, a furrow was emerging: well-behaved rave, taking bits of house, garage, and reggaeton and rendering them in soft pastel shades on remixes for artists like Glass Animals, Fever Ray, and—an obvious influence—Caribou.Among Mother’s 12 tracks, a solid vocal house EP lurks: three trim, catchy songs with slick pop vocals, not hard or hip enough for underground dancefloors but miles classier than anything blaring out over the stairmasters at your gym. “Every Lil” is the best of them, tapping into the heat of Miami’s Latin club scene through MJ Nebreda’s soft-stroke vocals, a reggaeton-house rhythm, splashy drums from DJ Plead, and—why not?—the chord progression from “Music Sounds Better With You.” It’s smart; it works. The other two are sturdy singles, but could have been made any time in the last decade: “Self to Blame,” with California singer Kayla Blackmon, provides punchy dance-pop on the Disclosure-to-Dua Lipa continuum, and “Promises” is polished to a shine by Kaytranada collaborator Rochelle Jordan.What’s left over is puzzlingly anonymous. Pushed further and deeper, this material might’ve been its own record—a set of supple, deep house for well-groomed dancefloors, all moisturised and minty of breath. “Heartbeat” turns simplicity to its advantage, ping-ponging around a chiming bassline redolent of Jaydee’s ’90s house classic “Plastic Dreams.” “All You Like,” with its dreamy minor chords sighing around an insistent vocal, is in thrall to Caribou and Four Tet—but without the quirks and tics that gird her elders’ oddball genius. “Grown on Me” serves up the same sort of soft-boiled UK bass, lacking in structure beyond the usual build, rise, drop, repeat. Even cranked up loud, this just isn’t functional dance music—there’s an empty space where the oomph should be.",Electronic,5.9
357,"The follow-up to Renaissance is a powerful and ambitious country album cast in the singular mold of Beyoncé. She asserts her rightful place in the genre as only a pop star of her incredible talent and influence can do. If Lemonade taught us anything, it’s that you do not fuck with Beyoncé. Her 2016 opus was her seething response to being wronged, giving us the indelible image of a smiling woman in a yellow dress carrying a baseball bat and the enduring specter of Becky and her good hair. We already know what happens when something meddles with her peace—she puts her whole being into righting the wrongs, enacting her revenge with a twinkle in her eye, extra gumption in her voice, and ice in her veins. There’s a particular edge when one of the world’s biggest music superstars has a chip on her shoulder. This doesn’t often occur—of late, Beyoncé has been acting as a beatific Mother in every way—but when it does, boy howdy, look out.Lemonade, as it happened, may have helped plant the seed for Cowboy Carter, which was “born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcomed… and it was very clear that I wasn’t.” It seems she is referring to her 2016 appearance at the Country Music Association Awards, in which she performed Lemonade’s Texas country triumph “Daddy Lessons” with the Chicks, who were also once exiled by the entire country music apparatus. As they played the song and after it ended, Beyoncé was met with reactions that ranged from cool sneers to racist vitriol, both in the crowd and online.At that moment, it was clear that even Beyoncé’s Texas bona fides wouldn’t protect her from the longstanding racism and sexism that still existed in the country mainstream, despite Black musicians creating the spark of country music and Black Americans creating the foundations of the country itself. “Because of that experience,” she wrote, “I did a deeper dive into the history of country music and studied our rich musical archive… the criticisms I faced when I first entered this genre forced me to propel past the limitations that were put on me.” The country music establishment got Beyoncé doing homework. The guns they are a-blazin’.But, as Beyoncé has clarified, Cowboy Carter—or Act II, the follow-up to the 2022 dance album Renaissance—is not a country album. Rather, Beyoncé has ventured into Louisiana Cajun country, the rivers of Alabama, the streets of Memphis, the great Oklahoma plains, and within her memories of multiracial Texas rodeos to create yet another world in her image. It’s partly rooted in Western tropes but with a pointed look toward the America that’s often erased on the CMAs stage—and in the public school history books. The album’s press release reminds us that the etymology of the word “cowboy,” which comes from the Spanish “vaquero,” derives in part from white ranchers calling their white employees “cowhands,” and their Black employees the diminutive “cowboy.” By using country as a starting point for experimentation and recalling genre-porous artists like Ray Charles, Candi Staton, Charley Pride, and the Pointer Sisters, Cowboy Carter asserts Beyoncé’s place in this long legacy while showcasing the ever-expanding reaches of her vocal prowess.",Folk,8.4
358,"The Swedish savants team up for their first collaborative project, a sincere commitment to alt-rock and post-punk that brings the genres’ darkness into a new era. A decade ago, before the words “Drain Gang” were ever uttered, Yung Lean and Bladee were the twin flames at the forefront of the Swedish Invasion. Despite the longevity of their creative relationship—and the fact that the collective has always seemed to prioritize their genuine friendships over business transactions—the duo has never actually released a full collaborative project until now. While both artists have flirted with guitar music and rock star aesthetics since their genesis, Psykos sincerely commits to an alt-rock and post-punk palette. More than a step forward, though, it’s also a look back: “Ten years, blood, sweat, and love, still standing tall,” as Lean sings on “Golden God.” Their sound in between genres is a natural byproduct of a life lived in-between, lost in the liminal transience of touring, shuffling from one hotel room and relationship to the next.With last year’s Sugar World, Lean introduced his schmaltzy Thin White Duke era; here, he transforms into a version of himself closer to Ian Curtis or Robert Smith. It’s a fitting sound for an album that is in many ways about reckoning with the trauma of touring stardom—the titular declaration of “Golden God” inevitably Almost Famous, another story about a precocious kid exposed to the pleasures and perils of rock’n’roll at far too young an age. On the anthemic blog-rock groove “Sold Out,” the pair sing not just about losing their childhoods, but completely destroying them: “I killed my youth/I watched it fall.”If Psykos is an open-casket funeral for lost innocence, then opening “Coda” is a tender eulogy delivered at the service. So often, the cherubic Bladee has played the ethereal angel, but here he embodies a tempting devil, his crooning voice summoned once Lean says, “I hear God talking/But it’s overshadowed by El Diablo.” From that reflective intro onward, Psykos strips away almost any semblance of the trancey Eurotrash pastiche and lacquered hyper-pop gloss that this collective has become known for. In lieu of the ethereal gnosticism of Drain Gang is a kind of Zen nihilism that finds solace in the comforting stillness of a dark and empty void. When Bladee sings of making “the jump without wings” on “Still,” you can either take it as suicidal ideation, or a leap of faith.Sometimes the effects-heavy guitar recalls Eno-produced U2 or Parachutes-era Coldplay, but woozier and more dissociative—probably the result of the counterintuitive cocktail of kratom and codeine that Lean claims to have been drinking regularly during recording sessions in Thailand. On the eerie “Still,” titanic cymbals crash into streaks of effects-heavy guitar, while “Things Happen” slips into a more intimate acoustic mode. Most of the overt hip-hop influence is stripped away, but Lean slips into a blunted rap flow on “Ghosts” as Bladee serenades him with circuitous loops, and their penchant for tight hooks lends itself to anthemic singalongs like “Sold Out.”",Rap,8.0
359,"Working with cello, digital processing, and field recordings, the New York composer creates a gripping ode to the dynamism of nature and the beauty of transformation. On stage, experimental cellist MIZU handles her instrument more like a dance partner than a hunk of curved wood. She stands, knees slightly bent, twirling and swaying her cello by the neck, occasionally stretching out her foot to set off an effects pedal. “It’s almost like a ballet,” MIZU told New Sounds host John Schaefer last year, suggesting that her expressive maneuvering of the cello, and her ability to undulate alongside it, might be stifled if she sat and played in a more conventional manner. The classically trained musician can’t help but tweak tradition: While studying at Juilliard, MIZU was more intrigued by modernist composers Elliot Carter and Milton Babbitt than wigged titans like Mozart and Bach. She ultimately grew frustrated “playing the same Beethoven sonata that 1,000 other cellists across the world play with equal facility,” as she recalled to Schaefer.Meeting guitarist and composer Rachika Nayar in Brooklyn’s queer party scene cracked open new possibilities for MIZU after college. Nayar taught her how to warp her instrument with electronics. On her 2023 debut, Distant Intervals, MIZU tracked cello phrases in her closet before layering, looping, and manipulating them digitally. On her new LP Forest Scenes, MIZU inverts the technique, composing high, shining arches of cello around digital dissonance and field recordings that capture the chatter and roar of the woods. Teeming with texture—whispered phrases, dry foliage, dial-up distortion—the gripping 37-minute instrumental is an ode to transformation. Frequently gorgeous, at times unsettling, Forest Scenes is constantly in flux.MIZU was initiating a process of gender transition while writing Forest Scenes, and elements of growth and change are ingrained within her pieces. On the slithering “Pavane,” tremulous strands of cello twist together like vines in a time-lapse video, while a convention of birds confabs in the trees. Though distinct, these elements seem to sprout from the same ecosystem, and each additional detail enriches the landscape, be it belching bowed strings, plucked melodies, or staccato breath darting around the perimeter.On Distant Intervals, MIZU ornamented her neoclassical playing with electronic flourishes. But the jungle racket and harsh digital passages of Forest Scenes—which were recorded before MIZU even picked up a bow—are structurally and thematically vital to each song. On “Pump,” crisp twigs and leaves snap underfoot before yielding to MIZU’s insistent, almost nagging loops of cello. As the piece crescendos and tapers, the forest footsteps reemerge, their crunching turned to sloshing, as if entering a shallow brook. This slight detail suggests an entire journey.",Experimental,7.7
360,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit Photek’s 1997 debut, a breathtaking, transcendent drum’n’bass album that changed the language and landscape of the genre. The kid had been standing in the corner of the record store for a good while, soaking up the sound of the jungle 12""s spinning on the shop’s turntables, when he approached the counter with a puzzled observation. “I’ve been listening for half an hour,” he said to the shopkeeper, “and every tune’s got the same drums.”It would have been easy to scoff at the comment, to write it off as the uninformed perspective of a newbie—it was, after all, the early 1990s—or the opinion of a cloth-eared contrarian. How many times have electronic music fans heard a similar gripe? It all sounds alike. Every song has the same beat. I’ve been listening to this DJ for half an hour and I don’t think he’s changed the record once.Put yourself in the clerk’s shoes and you might imagine responding with a heavy sigh, If you’re looking for an Oasis record, HMV is across the street. Or maybe, more charitably: Mate, that’s the way jungle is supposed to sound. Here’s a Reinforced comp and a rave flyer—come talk to me next week.But recalling the exchange a few years later, the man behind the counter that day—Rupert Parkes, better known as the celebrated drum’n’bass savant Photek—had a different reaction. “I couldn’t really argue with that, it was true!” he told Muzik magazine in 1996. “Everyone uses the same breaks. It’s very rare to find a new break which is really worth using. They’re drying up. It’s like oil, it’s not going to go on forever, so you’ve got to look for alternative sources.”Parkes certainly seemed like someone who had discovered a game-changing new power supply. He had a critically acclaimed EP, The Hidden Camera, under his belt, along with a freshly signed five-album deal with Virgin that would soon take the 24-year-old producer from St Albans, 20 miles northwest of London, to a seat behind the wheels of a series of sports cars (Lotus Elan, Ferrari 348, Porsche Carrera S) in quick succession. If the ubiquitous breakbeats then clogging up record bins were the equivalent of fossil fuels—archaic, polluting, the stuff of dead dinosaurs—Photek’s 1997 debut LP, Modus Operandi, would appear to be powered by something more like cold fusion: a breathtaking, mind-bending rhythmic force that seemed to defy the laws of physics.Jungle had reached peak breakbeat remarkably fast. The genre had only been around for a couple of years, the latest step in a rapid-fire evolution that had begun with the arrival of American house and techno upon the UK’s shores in the mid-to-late 1980s. When rave culture took off, British dance music was a hodgepodge of inputs: Black American house and techno; vintage soul, disco, and rare groove; Belgian and Italian house; Jamaican dub and reggae; and—crucially—hip-hop, both American originals and Brit imitations.",Electronic,8.8
361,"NTS’ latest compilation is a brain-frying rollercoaster of club maximalism, showcasing the funk paulista underworld’s endless creativity. São Paulo’s funk scene is, in part, a product of the city’s extreme urban structure and social conditions. Often called a “concrete jungle,” the megacity holds Brazil’s largest population and one of its densest; it is heavily industrialized with imposing buildings spread over a monstrous size, all of which bleeds into a metallic, destructive take on Brazilian funk. NTS’ new compilation, funk.BR - São Paulo, crams the far-ranging styles of mandelão, bruxaria, and beyond into 22 exclusive tracks, providing a whistle-stop tour with which you can jump off and immerse yourself in this grippingly rebellious sound.The network of genres that fall under the mandelão umbrella do not have the longer-standing history of the root Rio de Janeiro funk carioca scene, but they have evolved rapidly because of their spirit of one-upmanship. Lança-perfume, a drug that comes from ethyl chloride and produces hallucinogenic, sound-sensitive sensations, is a fixture at street parties, creating ear-ringing tones that are central to various styles of mandelão. Meanwhile, the funk automotivo culture of souped-up cars, with walls of rear-trunk speakers, have buffed the low-end. With over 1,700 registered favelas in the city, each more or less coming with their own flair, the sheer size and noise of the metropolis pushes artists to stand out and claim the loudest, the most unpredictable, the most original sound as their own. In doing so, they’re pushing far beyond the precipice of what we’ve come to expect—creating mixes that obscure and pronounce elements in experimental ways, folding the club music structure tightly for triple the amount of breakdowns, and upping the loudness to new levels of club maximalism. In addition to reflecting the genre’s continued popularity in underground electronic spaces in the Global North, funk.BR pushes these sounds  further still.Funk mandelão tunes ring out like beacons to the underworld, wedding ear-dazzling techno pulses with the familiar falling funk rhythm and putting it in a vat of dense smoke. Toplines cross dull hits of bells and metal pans with rave synths (DJ Pikeno MPC & MC BF’s “Acende o Sinalizador”), whistling (DJ P7 & MC PR’s “Automotivo Destruidor, P7 Vai Te Destruir”), and bamboo flutes (DJ Lorrany’s “Mandela Cunt”). Hoarse male antiheroes yell a Rolodex of commands—“obedece” and “galopa,” which mean to “obey” and “ride”—and female MCs like MC Bibi Drak flirt like video vixens. But both are unfazed as they are caught and squeezed in a tempest of surreal abrasion in the breakdowns.The tracks on funk.BR speed by with a bullish impatience that is disorienting, tossing and turning between intensely physical automotivo, eye-swirling ritmado, and ear-rending bruxaria. DJ Léo da 17 & DJ BIG ORIGINAL’s “Bruxaria de Extrema Periculosidade” takes just 14 seconds before the infectious “Bi-Bi-Big Original!” producer tag commences a flipbook-fast layering of shotgun kick drums. Blink and you’ll miss how ​​“Best of Both Worlds from Brazil” by DJ Livea & iamlope$$ flies through marching trumpets over compressed tambor drums, a drill breakdown, horn-backed samba, and beat bolha (a style literally meaning “bubble beat”) in just over two minutes.",NTS,7.8
362,"Working with the Yamaha Disklavier—a digital descendant of the player piano—the New York musician explores the tension between technical precision and emotional reverie. Kelly Moran treats the piano as an object to be transformed. The New York musician wrings metallic clangs from its strings and slathers each note in sustain, until the instrument loses its telltale form and morphs into something psychedelic and dreamlike. She established her reverie-like style with 2017’s Bloodroot and further expanded it on 2018’s excellent Ultraviolet, in which fuzz-coated melodies magnified and shrank like the patterns of a kaleidoscope. With Moves in the Field, she strips her music down. Where she used to work with prepared piano, she recorded the new album on the Yamaha Disklavier, a digital descendant of the player piano. While continuing to explore the furthest reaches of her instrument, this time she turns inward, writing intricate melodies that evoke a sense of interiority.Moran began working with the Disklavier in early 2020, when Yamaha loaned her one to try out while she was working on a piece with fellow composer Missy Mazzoli. The machine, renowned for its technical precision, taught her something unexpected: how to find emotional intensity in softness. She began her compositions by playing looping melodies on the instrument, then stepped away and played them back, listening to find space for gentleness. Finally, she played in real time along with those recordings, layering her fluid performance above the precise playback of the Disklavier. The results are more complex than she could have played on her own. The Disklavier allowed her to create layers and patterns that exceed the physical limitations of the most talented human pianist. But despite these complex techniques, Moran’s music feels anything but demanding. Instead, she lets warmth ring out, finding sweetness within the rapid-fire arpeggios facilitated by the instrument.Moran’s music gradually unfolds over the course of looped melodies that feel both unhurried and like running up a hill, evoking the fast-paced twirls and grace of the ice skaters that inspire her. Much of Moran’s music is driven by technical prowess, but she still finds room for lightness. Opener “Butterfly Phase” foregrounds rippling, fast-paced phrases that interweave like the strands of a spiderweb; on “Superhuman,” she pairs sparkling melodies that flutter up and down the scales while a meditative melody stews underneath.Though repetition and precision are at the core of her music, Moran focuses less on interlocking rhythmic patterns and more on forming sweeping melodies out of short phrases that evolve over time. “Dancer Polynomials,” one of the album’s most detailed tracks, pairs a brisk, soft melody that churns above a bed of pensive low tones. These two lines feel like they’re in opposition—one airy, one weighty—but they grow together, and by the end, they swirl into a heady union. Album highlight “Sodalis II” balances the emotion and technique that drive Moran’s music. The piece grows from a measured phrase and unfolds into a deep, resonant meditation, informed by Moran’s increasing emphasis on each downbeat and the slight pauses she takes before rolling a chord. As the music crescendos, she encircles its core with speedy riffs, until all the melodies crumble away, leaving a palpable feeling of catharsis.",Experimental,7.8
363,"On the follow-up to last year’s Erotic Probiotic 2, the Baltimore musician continues to twist the sounds of ’80s dream pop and R&B into a strange, heartfelt picture of a world on the brink. The rapturous response to Marcus Brown’s debut album as Nourished by Time, Erotic Probiotic 2, has come to look more like destiny. After years of odd jobs, false starts, and aborted artistic experiments, the Baltimore native and Berklee College of Music alum spent COVID holed up in his parents’ basement concocting a new sound, blithely unconcerned about what the world might think. Armed with Ableton, electric guitar, and a Roland Juno-106 synthesizer, Brown blended dream pop, ’80s R&B, deep house, electro-funk, hip-hop, and Baltimore club in daring, original ways while expressing socialist ideas and spiritual concerns in an earnest, naked baritone redolent of the Blue Nile’s Paul Buchanan and Jodeci’s K-Ci Hailey. It’s difficult to fathom the record as a debut; it has the timeworn air of an album that took years to make—and the fast-and-free ethos of a practiced savant finally willing to let it fly.Since Erotic Probiotic 2’s release last spring, Brown has landed loads of new fans, critical acclaim, cross-the-pond tour dates, and a freshly inked deal with XL Recordings, though he’s become skeptical of such conventional measures of success. “This is now an extension of my labor,” he said in a recent interview. “It’s another version of working at Whole Foods, just, like, a lot cooler.” Nourished by Time’s latest EP, Catching Chickens, expands upon Erotic Probiotic 2’s sprawling, singular universe while also hinting at new sounds, shapes, and textures he might explore down the road. As ever, incisive political insights and poignant emotions shine through the mutant genre melds, reaffirming the sneakily transgressive nature of Brown’s approach to pop.At its best, Catching Chickens subverts playful, exuberant moods with biting social commentary. On opener “Hell of a Ride,” Brown laments the ills of late-stage capitalism over ’80s dance euphoria: “Children stuck in the matrix/They know when it’s fiction/Young, breathing in them toxins/Used to have a third place now they got no options.” After the chorus (“the red, the blue, and even the white… never felt like mine”), the song dissolves into hollow guitars and warbling synths, sketching an ambiguous sonic picture of what societal collapse might feel like: terrifying yet cathartic, isolating yet inspiring. Lead single “Hand on Me” bops with stretchy synths and vocal harmonies, detailing a forlorn yet impassioned love—romantic or otherwise—that’s both comforting and psychosis-inducing. These songs reflect Brown’s uncanny ability to couch complex subject matter in delightful DIY pop. He never strains to mesh form with content; instead, the two are always inextricably and effortlessly linked.",Pop,7.7
364,"The startlingly accomplished solo debut from the art-pop singer-songwriter is a world of birdsong, whistles, hums, and silence, anchored by her magnetic voice. Alena Spanger prefers non-verbal communication. On her new album, Fire Escape, she is partial to birdsong, wind that chimes like Erik Satie, and the sound of rain hitting the roof at dawn. In Tiny Hazard, the experimental pop group she formed with college classmates, she whispered, giggled, gasped, and howled over feverish guitars and jagged basslines. Her elastic vocals, which evoke the kineticism of Björk on “It’s Oh So Quiet” and Karin Dreijer on “Heartbeats,” are often most powerful as wordless interjections—a sudden “ha!” mid-verse or a maniacal cackle at the end of a chorus. On Fire Escape, her solo debut, Spanger and a collective of fellow Brooklyn musicians construct a dreamlike atmosphere of wind instruments, harps, and synths around her operatic range.When she does reach for words, Spanger takes inspiration from nature’s fury and splendor, rather than more muted human emotions. On the twinkling “Ines,” she’s not just paralyzed by apprehension—she is both underwater and on fire. On the slow-moving “Agios,” “a man’s pain” isn’t simply destructive—it “hollers down the mountain, with the grace of a giant.” Her loved ones are like “starfish,” and the ocean is as much an existential threat (“Fire Escape”) as a source of absolution (“Satie Song”). Spanger refers to herself in self-deprecating terms—“a fickle girl,” a “sly wicked child”—but withholds details, gesturing at seesaws and lavender fields as shorthands for shortcomings. She shades in the vagueness with sharp inhales, speechless stutters, and single syllables repeated like mantras. It is, as she sings on “All That I Wanted,” “illegible and whole,” her words more deeply felt as they shapeshift and disconnect from meaning.Fire Escape covers a surprising amount of ground in just over 40 minutes—the slightly askew dance pop of “Sinking Like,” the impressionistic, ambient textures of “Fire Escape” and “My Feel,” the jittery rock of “Ines.” With Spanger’s voice at the center, discordant transitions, like “All That I Wanted” leading into the lullabye-esque, aptly named “Go to Sleep,” feel part of a whole, connected by synth pads and the slight rasp at the corners of her range. The surrounding instrumentation expands and contracts to fit Spanger’s many modes: the gentle rumble of Carmen Quill’s upright bass and Kalia Vandever’s trombone on “My Feel” echo the elegiac solitude in her voice; the harp on “Ines,” played by Kitba’s Rebecca El-Saleh, matches the fantastical elements in its lyrics. But often her voice needs very little additional accompaniment—like former tourmate Adrianne Lenker, Spanger is most evocative at her quietest: When she dips into a low, hushed tone on “Methuen,” the world around her grows silent to accommodate.",Pop,7.8
365,"On his chic, adventurous, hybrid-pop debut, Benjamin Lyman is a world-weary optimist and DIY maximalist with a voice fit for the mainstream yet made for the arthouse The first sound you hear on Benjamin Lyman’s debut album as 1010Benja, Ten Total, is either a throat clearing or a deadpan laugh, an announcement or a provocation. A symphony of programmed horns and strings comes in and Benja begins barking and cooing, sheeshing and coughing, shouting ad-libs—“Hey, man! Hey!”—and unleashing a string of effortless vocal runs. A gunshot pops; an engine revs. Then sirens and bit-crushed battlefield FX swallow the song, leaving nothing but shrapnel. Playful, strange, and surprisingly moving, it’s the perfect introduction to Benja’s oddball brilliance: a world-weary optimist and DIY maximalist with a sinewy, astonishing voice meant for the mainstream yet made for the arthouse.Ten Total delivers on years of anticipation and promise for a transcendent talent who’s remained mostly anonymous since the start of his career. When Pitchfork called the Kansas City singer and producer “one of 2018’s most promising artists,” he’d only put out three songs. His first EP, Two Houses, released on the heels of this acclaim, suggested a burgeoning star on the cusp of his best work. But as quickly as Benja appeared, he vanished. He’s dropped a few singles in recent years, but the initial hype, faintly redolent of House of Balloons-era the Weeknd and Nostalgia, Ultra-era Frank Ocean, has all but dissipated. It’s easy to conclude that the 34-year-old Benja missed his moment.If Ten Total proves anything, it’s that Benja’s just fine occupying his own self-defined stratosphere. Though his sound has plenty of precedents—his voice a supercharged hybrid of Jeremih and Justin Timberlake, his rangy production pulling from ’90s Björk and early 2010s Kanye—it’s unmistakably his, unique in its agglomeration. One moment he’s rapping with kinetic ease over a slippery Acid Rap-type beat (“Peacekeeper”), the next he’s belting a glamorous hook over horns and strings and clattering cymbals (“H2HAVEYOU”). Ten Total glides between neo-soul, alt-R&B, drill, gospel, trap, and radio-ready pop while Benja obliquely circles a set of core themes: love and redemption, gratitude and faith, loss and deliverance.His voice, pliable and precise, allows him to flit effortlessly between moods and styles. “Peacekeeper” and “Penta,” for instance, are skeletal freestyles whose nonchalance gives them a curious gravitas. In the former, he balances humor with wisdom, dashing off lines about “trusting hoes,” watching Star Trek, and reading Alan Moore before triumphantly spitting, “I had to go get it, I couldn’t fold/I had to get up, I couldn’t be told.” On “Penta” he repeats a bar about feeling stupid before groaning, scatting, and making a noise that can only be described as a chortle. It’s invigorating, and funny, to hear Benja stretch his voice to its weirdest depths, à la Playboi Carti or Tom Waits. When the album’s more robust songs materialize, like the warm electro-R&B strutter “Twin” or the searing ballad “Waterworks,” the breadth of his talent reveals itself. Benja could make a cleaner, more straightforward pop or R&B album—he certainly has the voice for it. Instead he dabbles with different forms and flows, playing with bright hues and gummy textures to create his own twisted sense of cohesion.",Pop,8.6
366,"On her dazzlingly detailed new album of experimental post-footwork, the Indiana producer pushes extreme rhythmic precision so far that it begins to feel psychedelic. Rigor is a virtue for Jlin. The Gary, Indiana producer and composer born Jerrilynn Patton is the kind of artist who watches Whiplash and identifies with the teacher, who’s argued that “you shouldn’t create simply because it sounds good to you,” who rejects loops and builds her fearsome post-footwork beats from scratch. It’s surprising, then, to learn that she left a few “mistakes” in her 2017 opus Black Origami; “I like feeling vulnerable,” she told Tone Glow. But while that album seemed to fly off the rails in exactly the way the creator desired, her new album Akoma radiates cool, simmering control. There’s never any doubt that each percussive element and textural glint has landed precisely where Patton intended, yet this samurai-precise music is as unpredictable as a shroomy Ricardo Villalobos odyssey. There’s a delightful contrast at play: Despite the record’s un-psychedelic qualities, the way it yanks the synapses could make you swear you’re seeing colors.Akoma is technically Jlin’s third album, and her first new solo LP since Black Origami, but the breadth of her craft has expanded vastly in the time between. She scored Autobiography, a dance piece by Wayne McGregor, and pushed her sound into gnarlier realms of tech-noise on her Embryo EP; most auspiciously, she became a Pulitzer finalist for Perspective, a collaboration with Third Coast Percussion. It feels like a miraculous journey for a producer who started out making beats while working 96-hour weeks at a steel mill—and who emerged from a hyper-regional Black dance subgenre that’s been underground for such a long time the 36-year-old Patton recalls hearing footwork at a neighbor’s house when she was four. But Patton’s always been that good, ever since she debuted on the seminal Bangs & Works Vol. 2 compilation with “Erotic Heat”; Pitchfork’s Jonathan Williger was right to question in his Perspective why it took collaborating with a classical ensemble for the Pulitzers to take notice.Akoma wears its classical bona fides on its sleeve, not least with guest appearances by Philip Glass and the Kronos Quartet. Neither of them is really asked to do much: Glass’s spider-fingered études fill the gaps between the drums on “The Precision of Infinity,” while Kronos saw away madly in the distance on “Sodalite.” It’s funny that Jlin’s actual collaboration with a string quartet is so much less string-heavy than “Summon,” a sort of warped chamber piece that seems perpetually poised to collapse like some delicate paper structure. For that matter, Björk is a ghost on “Borealis,” which came from a proposed collaboration whose parts Jlin salvaged for her own purposes. These luminaries’ names seem present in the credits for the same reason Patton decided to name one track after an Egyptian goddess and another after her “Grannie’s Cherry Pie” (actually a cobbler, it turns out): These figures are as much collaborators as inspirations and exemplars, pushing Patton to give her best.",Electronic,8.0
367,"The London singer and producer’s glamorous, infernally catchy new dance-pop record suffers from a deeply modern affliction. Pop music feels cursedly literal right now: Ariana Grande is singing about how she “spent so much on therapy”; Billie Eilish’s Barbie is a transparently straightforward plot summary of Barbie; Kacey Musgraves’ new album is a ripped-from-the-group-chat account of going through a breakup and communing with nature. It’s not a problem exclusive to A-listers. It’s Over, the second album by London producer and singer Tatyana, is riddled with literalism, therapyspeak, and phrases that are profoundly overused on TikTok: “I’m down bad,” “touching grass,” “acting like a fan.” One wonders if there’s a new pharmaceutical doing the rounds that saps a pop star’s desire for subtext and mystery.Thankfully, Tatyana has an ace up her sleeve. It’s Over may suffer from a deeply modern affliction, but it’s also a supreme pleasure to listen to, a glamorous, fine-tuned dance-pop record filled with brazen, mercenary hooks and hypnotic synth lines that sound squelchy and spiky at the same time. Even as her lyrics dip into the sans-serif blandness of contemporary pop, Tatyana manages to refute its other fatal flaw—melody-averse mushiness—with songs that bullishly force their way into your brain.It’s Over was produced by Tatyana with Mikko Gordon (Idles, Arcade Fire), and it feels of a piece with high-saturation early-career records by artists like Tirzah and the Knife. Like those artists, Tatyana often alludes to analog house and techno but rarely dives in fully. Instead, she takes formal instruction from those genres: Part of the reason songs like “Down Bad” and “Hold My Hand” are so punishingly catchy is that their hooks repeat over and over like samples in a classic Detroit track, sometimes layering the phrase on the beat and other times throwing it in haphazardly. Despite their condensed forms, these songs play masterfully with tension and relief in a way that makes their limited emotional landscapes feel like a feature, not a bug.At other times, Tatyana’s vocals can feel mismatched with her production. “It’s Over,” a blocky, lurching track on which she sings about feeling emotionally volatile, features the kind of winkingly dramatic performance that might have felt more at home on her 2022 debut Treat Me Right, which dealt more in clean, soaring ’80s-inspired pop. “Out of Time,” a lovely, melancholy ballad, is underserved by its grand, almost OPN-esque synth maelstrom finale, and by the fact that it arrives two songs after “I Do Care (& That’s Okay),” a slow-building piece of hazy electronica that does a better job with the same conceit. But Tatyana’s warm, smoky voice is perfectly at home on “Control” and “Nothing Is True, Everything Is Possible,” two simmering late-night house tracks that feel equal parts moody and cheeky.These brighter moments are let down by lyrics that veer into total glibness. On “Down Bad,” clumsy lines like “All I do is feel my feelings/I write my silly little songs each evening” stall an otherwise riotous, sharply written song; on “We’re Back,” the heady idea of a potential reunion with an ex is undercut by a repeated hook of “we’re so back,” a phrase that’s overused and somewhat meaningless. Tatyana says that she wrote the lyrics for It’s Over in the way she would speak to her friends, but the result is an album that’s wildly proficient in one area and totally underwhelming in another—so off-balanced that you feel like it could topple at any moment.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

368,"Two of rap’s biggest hitmakers team up for a sleek, vengeful project that somewhat successfully tries to recapture the feeling of an event album. Future and Metro Boomin are wistful for the days when rap regularly had moments, the kind of moments that had you FOMO-racing to your computer. Nothing was worse than being out of the loop. Remember when Nicki Minaj blacked out on “Monster”? When Funk Flex lost his mind during his premiere of Kanye and Jay-Z’s “Otis”? When Kendrick started a civil war with “Control”? When Drake and Meek Mill were at each other’s necks? When Future dropped his mixtape-run victory lap Dirty Sprite 2 and shot to the moon? Those days were fun. With their vengeful, event album We Don’t Trust You, Future and Metro seek to recapture that essence by creating a moment of their own.And who better to orchestrate an event than two of rap’s essential hitmakers of the last decade teaming up for what is billed as their first official joint album—even if the heads know that it is really DS2. Just the sight of their names alongside each other is enough to bring back memories of “Radical,” “Thought It Was a Drought,” “Mask Off,” or any of their other smashes. Though, as far as Future’s collaborators go, I would have rather heard his album with Nard & B or DJ Spinz or Mike WiLL Made-It, producers who helped to shape his druggy trap blues but have never gotten the chance to flesh that out. A Future and Metro album has no choice other than to be a supernova, so We Don’t Trust You is much safer and more conservative than I imagine any of those would be. The only room to tread new ground is by going bigger and glitzier.Metro has been headed down that path for a while, tinkering with the cinematic evolution of his Southern trap roots. There was the glossy 2022 solo album Heroes & Villains, which felt like his audition to curate the music of a superhero movie. Six months later he did exactly that with the heavily polished soundtrack for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. That shine bleeds into the production of We Don’t Trust You; smooth and spotless and heavy on showy beat switch-ups and orchestral touches. For example, “Young Metro” builds up to a synth explosion that booms as pristinely as a Hans Zimmer score.That’s fine for Hollywood music intended to blast from the loudspeakers at amusement parks, but with production that has a trap foundation, the blemishes, the kinks, the idiosyncrasies, even if purposeful, are everything. Metro was a hitmaker who always got weird with it: the fuzzy 808s on “I Serve the Base” hit like a firestorm, the synths on “Wesley Presley” are like alien transmissions. In fact, some of the coolest Atlanta rap of the last year, such as Ken Carson’s A Great Chaos, is rough, messy, and influenced by the controlled havoc of old Metro. Here, the beats aren’t drastically different from what he would have done eight or nine years ago—you could picture Slime Season Thug on “Slimed In” or Savage Mode-era 21 Savage on “GTA”—except for the fact that it feels like they’ve been hosed down with sanitizer.",Rap,7.0
369,"The South African singer’s star-making debut is a lithe, contemporary take on pop-R&B that pulses with the log-drum heartbeat of amapiano. “Water,” Tyla’s first major label single, had a rare sort of alchemy: sultry, cheeky vocals on a humid dancefloor anthem with a chorus so divine that hearing it over and over was actually appealing. The 22-year-old’s lithe blend of amapiano and R&B shot her to seemingly instant ubiquity in the second half of 2023, as “Water” blasted from streetside subwoofers, through club sound systems, and across the TikToks of young acolytes and horny dudes. (The song’s oiled-up video featured Tyla slow-wining as she doused herself with a bottle of agua, accounting in part for the horny dudes.) A little over six months after its release, “Water” had earned Tyla the Recording Academy’s first-ever Grammy for African Music Performance, edging out global superstars like Burna Boy and Davido, as well as Asake and Olamide’s well-deserving “Amapiano.” It was the kind of industry anointment—off one big single, not yet an album—that aspiring pop stars dream about.Though amapiano has ascended from South African clubs to the global charts, the broad appeal of “Water” lies in Tyla’s voice, which seems attuned to contemporary R&B in the same way that Rihanna’s debut single “Pon de Replay” was geared to split the middle between pop and dancehall. Tyla’s pre-“Water” music, crafted not long after she graduated high school, inclined towards the underground; her first single “Getting Late,” from 2019, emphasized the sparse interplay between her angelic voice and club-centric 808s. “Been Thinking,” from 2021, had its own anthemic chorus and a clever interpolation of Nelly’s “Hot in Herre,” displaying her admiration for Y2K-era radio hits on a rhythm whose lineage threaded through South African kwaito and back to another diasporic genre, UK funky.On her debut album Tyla, she flexes her fidelity to pop-R&B, weaving through its lingua franca—attraction to bad boys, puzzlement over bad boys, and finally the cathartic elation of moving on. It helps that the album pulses with amapiano’s log-drum heartbeat, with Wizkid collaborator and “Water” producer Sammy SoSo co-helming most tracks and brushing them to silky fluidity. The terrain is familiar but Tyla is playful within it, as on “Breathe Me,” a song about sex with a paramedic analogy (“Mouth to mouth when you’re touching me/Open up baby I’ll fill your lungs/CPR”) and a song-length meditation on how Tyla’s body is worthy of a high-end gallery (“ART”).She’s a savvy singer, capable of a full belt while mostly residing in the realm of sensuous breathiness, which gives her songs the air of an internal monologue. The vocal intimacy betrays her influences—she’s studied the Aaliyah canon—and her rendition is committed but cool, like she’s singing from the back of the club and hasn’t yet removed her sunglasses. In “On and On,” the Babygirlest of these tracks in name and execution, she unwinds the chorus as though whispering a secret, her easy melisma slinking through the bass.",Pop,8.0
370,"Working again with members of David Nance & Mowed Sound, the North Carolina singer-songwriter finds an easy, patient groove pitched between Americana and classic rock. Rosali Middleman, the singer-songwriter known as Rosali, first crossed paths with Nebraska rock guitarist David Nance out on tour. In his group’s full-bodied classic rock sound, she heard a kindred spirit—and a new possibility for what became her third album, 2021’s No Medium. After the reverb-heavy acoustic fare of her 2016 debut Out of Love and the steely edged folk rock of Trouble Anyway two years later, Nance and his band Mowed Sound helped to refract the flickering lamplight of her voice like a gold-veined vintage mirror. Together, they fashioned her Americana instincts—soft traces of pedal steel, banjo, and harp—into the warm, plush sound of 1960s rock’n’roll.Teaming once again with Nance and members of Mowed Sound on Bite Down, her new album and first release with Merge, Rosali commits definitively to rock’n’roll’s most well-worn textures. It’s clothing she wears well, sounding at times like Stevie Nicks’ drowsy-voiced niece in the way she assesses life’s lingering bruises with cool disregard. “Said it was nothing/Well, what was it then?” she sings with a hint of side-eye on “Is It Too Late.” The track moves along at an easy drift, reflecting Rosali’s outward indifference, until the band accelerates to a frenzy on the last chorus, and reveals the deeper ache provoking her retorts.Rosali perfumed No Medium with romance, but on Bite Down, those flowers have withered. New possibilities present themselves with no clear way forward. “I am here but I too may go/My body cares for nothing anymore,” she sings on the scuttling “Hopeless,” electric guitar fuzzy and dense behind her as she watches the last embers of love die out. Rosali has stumbled up against these questions before, but the hard-won confidence she displays across Bite Down is more willing to relinquish the need for an answer. “There is no way/No one way/Be there, OK/Be awake,” she sings on “Change Is in the Form.” James Schroeder’s glinting autoharp breaks up the album’s predilection for guitar jams, spiking the chorus with psychedelic sun glare.Rosali finds the headiest chemistry with the Mowed Sound on mid-tempo grooves like “Hopeless” or slow burns like “Hills on Fire,” which builds a kind of atmospheric heat lightning. You can hear their chummy interplay on the skittering rhythm of “On Tonight,” a warm-hearted confab that sets delicate traces of acoustic and electric guitar against JJ Idt’s thick, rolling bassline. But when they crank songs up, like the jump-start of the Crazy Horse-nodding “My Kind,” Rosali’s voice gets lost, her attitude of nonchalance running against the grain. “My Kind” waits for her to impart a larger emotional flourish, as when her voice rises in confession on “Hopeless,” but instead she holds back.",Folk,7.3
371,"Lorely Rodriguez’s fourth album is a dazzling showcase for her unexpected vocal and production approach as she experiences the peaks and valleys of heated romance. As Empress Of, Lorely Rodriguez has spent the past decade moving between punchy, upbeat synth-pop and introspective ballads with unselfconscious ease. Even when she’s leaned toward more mainstream pop, as on 2022’s Save Me EP, the Honduran American producer and singer-songwriter’s key influences have shined through. Whether she’s channeling the vertiginous serenades of Cocteau Twins or the contorted stylings of Imogen Heap, her catalog bursts with fizzy, unpredictable love songs in English and Spanish, which have landed her spots opening for pop stars like Carly Rae Jepsen and Rina Sawayama. On her fourth album, the independently released For Your Consideration, Rodriguez dials into an insatiable new groove, reprising an effusive, sensual point of view over propulsive dance and electropop. It’s the most intricate Empress Of album to date, a dazzling showcase for Rodriguez’s unexpected vocal and production approach as she experiences the peaks and valleys of heated romance.Rodriguez executive-produced For Your Consideration and tapped a fleet of other rising songwriters and producers to assist, including Casey MQ, Umru, Cecile Believe, and Nick León. The diverse spread helps map out the album’s mischievously unpredictable backdrops: These songs corkscrew and pull Rodriguez’s vocals like taffy, twisting into structures of their own; it’s as if she took Björk’s Medúlla as a conceptual north star and ran with it at full speed to the club. An opening suite of whispers morphs into a pitch-shifted pattern on the seductive “Sucia,” whose bilingual singsong verses lead to a deliciously bawdy chorus, her voice rising to a vibrant whoop. Later, her backing vocals swarm into a more ominous, chittering turn on the standout “Preciosa,” adding texture to the song’s deep bass and passionate come-ons. “Entra a mi mar/Mójate ya/Ya tú verás/Que te enamoras” (Enter my sea/Get wet/You’ll see that you’ll fall in love) she sings gently, before her voice crumples into a cooing, stuttering rhythm.For Your Consideration thrives on the elasticity of the human voice, while its lyrics turn from underhanded lovers to the flush of new affairs. Gasps and hiccups shape the fricative beat on the tender opening title track, which dissects a series of red flags, letting her words linger with fading desire. Here she riffs on the awards-season “for your consideration” campaigns that actors and directors run as a metaphor for an unbalanced relationship; the line, repeated during the chorus, takes on a pleading tone that slowly grows more steely with confidence. “You wrote the script,” she allows, coming to the realization with sharp lucidity. “Your words, not mine.”",Pop,8.3
372,"Beth Ditto’s second solo LP turned into a full-fledged Gossip comeback once her bandmates got involved. Rick Rubin captures the carefree vibes of old friends enjoying each other’s company. When Gossip announced their reunion last year, it looked like the Portland dance-punk trio had zipped into formation for the indie sleaze revival, the cultivators of its original aughts inspiration rightfully returning to their throne. But Gossip actually got back together in 2019, seven years after the band’s unexpected dissolution in 2012, when singer Beth Ditto returned to Rick Rubin’s home studio in Kauai to pen the follow-up to her debut solo album. Once she invited former bandmates Nathan Howdeshell to bounce ideas around with and Hannah Blilie to drum, those songwriting sessions turned collaborative quickly and, most promising of all, effortlessly. This was no longer a solo record; the band was back. “That’s the beauty of working with people you’ve known for so long,” Ditto told NME. “There’s no glamorous story, you just go: okay.”In reuniting without explicit intentions or expectations, Gossip created a comeback album, Real Power, that sidesteps the feeling of trying on old clothes. There’s no pressure to once again soundtrack Skins’, dominate sticky clubs at 2 a.m., or hoist nonconformist anthems into the sky as a political statement. With no predetermined agenda guiding the album, Real Power plays like the jovial, carefree sound of friends enjoying each other’s company; they just happen to have instruments in hand.Real Power slips into disco pop with a type of easygoing simplicity that begets happiness, even while Gossip address divorce, death, and isolation. Howdeshell and Blilie are to credit for that contradiction; the two continually lay down heavy grooves with a light touch, be it the sugar rush of “Edge of the Sun” or that gratuitous cowbell over slap bass on “Give It Up for Love.” Even when Ditto goes full diva belting out the title track, a glam anthem about Portland’s impassioned Black Lives Matter protests during the pandemic, she radiates pride: “Head is in the clouds, I’m moving mountains/Do you feel what I feel?” The way the three of them gyrate in sync is the answer.While modern-day peers are effectively updating the dance-punk sound through minimalist pop or trying too hard to emulate the rebellious partying that indie sleaze’s latter-day documentarians glorify, Gossip are looking beyond that altogether, instead emphasizing spontaneity and low-key beats. They dare you to dance to softer sounds, like a stripped-back bassline in the style of the xx on “Turn the Card” or the rakish fingersnaps pushed to the front of country redux “Peace and Quiet.” Early on, “Don’t Be Afraid” lays down a dub groove establishing mood better suited for smoking a joint on your friend’s couch than doing bumps in the club bathroom. While the songs on 2012’s A Joyful Noise often overstayed their runtimes, Real Power knows when to bail. On the sneaky standout “Light It Up,” Gossip craft a collective trance with mellow synths and dreamy guitar reverb that turn Ditto’s lyrics—“Start a fire/Let it rage/Burn it up/Watch it go down in flames”—into a meditation on rebirth and new beginnings.Ditto has always been colorful, from self-dying her hair with Kool-Aid in childhood to picking palettes for her plus-sized clothing line in Vogue. As she settles into her forties, she’s discovered that one of the most direct ways to extend her confidence, both to herself and others, is with patience. When Howdeshell relocated to his childhood farm in Arkansas in 2015 and became a born-again Christian, Ditto—an atheist—felt like she’d lost a friend to his past, and she mourned a creative death; in time, however, she learned to accept it. Over the bare beat of “Tough,” Ditto reflects on what it means to have faith in readjusted perceptions: “You need a change, so make a change/We’ll figure out something.” Much of Real Power revels in the way those deep breaths help steady us. In the case of Ditto’s scrapped sophomore solo album, they’re also to thank for Gossip’s graceful return in Real Power.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

373,"Foregrounding her voice for the first time against airy, otherworldly beats, the Brooklyn producer’s new tape is her most lucid and surprising to date. “I don’t want to tell you what I’m feeling,” Anysia Kym sings on “Test Your Patience,” and for a while, she might have been talking to us. The first few years of her career were spent playing drums for Blair, a Brooklyn band that braved cramped rehearsal spaces by day and threw shows with heavyweights like Wiki by night. Since departing the group in 2022, she’s lugged her percussive penchant into airy, otherworldly territory—less concerned with fringe rock’s fucked-up realities, and more infatuated with the hazy hypnagogia that strings shabby days together. On 2022’s Soliloquy and 2023’s Pressure Sensitive, she tossed artful alley-oops to the likes of MIKE, Niontay, and Jadasea, setting the table for some of her collaborators’ most psyched-out plays. After years of being a pass-first producer, Truest marks her first foray into pure scoring—solo tracks, only one feature—and shows flashes of a star in the making.If Kym’s discography is a collection of dreamscapes, the songs on Truest are lucid: No longer watching other characters brave her worlds, she waltzes through the house she’s spent years constructing. Like much of her earlier work, these songs come from a place of wistful longing; unlike anything she’s released before, they spotlight Kym’s singing voice, which claims a well-deserved spot in her woozy world. Album opener “Hesitations (Intro)” recalls dreamy R&B contemporaries like Liv.e and keiyaA, modulating and multiplying Kym’s murmurs to match the “faded,” “sedated” state she sketches out. Her chops—literally, chops—as a producer by now are familiar, but she foregrounds them in sinuous new shapes. “Test Your Patience” begins as a head-bopping saunter, until, within two minutes, Kym is gliding over a breakcore beat-switch, the way psychedelics might make you glide over grimy earth. “I’m convinced that this could be appealing,” she sings. She isn’t wrong.Truest is the first Kym release to feature multiple producers besides herself, which makes for compelling, if peculiar, extensions of her palette. The 454-produced “Pool of Life” is fast and futurist, a groove-heavy Goldilocks zone between FAST TRAX 3 and The Velvet Rope—picture Janet Jackson in the studio with Nintendo devs. Skater-slash-rapper Na-Kel Smith has long favored pitched-up vocals and brash bass; over his frenetic beat for “Owed2Me,” Kym’s voice is in tinnitus territory, not controlling chaos so much as contributing to it. But as tripped-out as it is, and disarming as it may be for longtime listeners, it’s promising to see her take new risks, exploring others’ creative worlds instead of shrinking back into her own. Between Blair and now, she’s lived a few different artistic lives: punk-adjacent drummer, prolific hip-hop producer, soulful R&B singer. Seeing her surprise isn’t necessarily surprising.",Pop,7.6
374,"Turning toward improvisation and meditative minimalism, the Los Angeles singer and songwriter’s latest album seeks a release from rational thought. It sounds fluid, sonorous, and free. In early 2020, while Julia Holter worked on a relatively swift follow-up to her 2018 opus, Aviary, two complications arose. The first, a pandemic, you know all about; the second, a lockdown pregnancy—well, just imagine. The shift flung this once prolific singer-songwriter into a period of stops and starts. She stopped performing, of course, and mostly stopped writing songs; perhaps most gravely of all, she stopped reading medieval texts. She started preparing for motherhood, then stopped preparing—motherhood was here! When she finally started recording, exhausted, things often went awry: She would stop singing and start yawning, occasionally dozing at the controls. This was no reflection of the music, though it is true that Something in the Room She Moves dispenses with her usual song and dance, distilling its vexed creation into one long, languorous thought. Stop talking, it suggests, and start listening.In the 13 years since Tragedy, her audacious, Euripidean debut, Holter has made contrasting demands of listeners. On one hand, her oeuvre has swung toward pop and back again. At the same time, she and her ensemble have charted a broader arc from intention to intuition. After the high-concept early entries—drawn from Hippolytus, Gigi, the process she calls “remixing texts”—improvisation meandered to the core of Holter’s practice, shepherded by collaborators like bassist Devin Hoff and multi-instrumentalist Tashi Wada.The Holter of Something in the Room She Moves sounds more determined than ever to renounce conscious authorship. The music—bubbly, nebulous, free—seems to have a mind of its own. The concept, if there is one, borrows the key principle of meditative minimalism: Reduce, reduce, and reduce to lift your spirit higher. Opener “Sun Girl” is the model in miniature, a sprightly little odyssey that could beguile a conservatory crowd but just as easily reduce—or indeed lift—a child to awestruck giggles.As well as her own daughter, Holter dedicates the album to her late nephew, “a beautiful young human who loved to make art, to debate ideas, and was passionate about socialist politics.” On “Talking to the Whisper,” a moment of devastating brilliance, she draws out distraught pleas—“Heaven can’t take my love”; “Love can be shattering”—but the true climax is a cosmic, wordless breakdown summoning the ecstatic grief of Alice Coltrane’s Universal Consciousness. In her recent live score for Carl Theodor Dreyer’s film The Passion of Joan of Arc, Holter sought a language of unintelligible chants, including “syllables decapitated from their word context,” to reflect lead actor Renée Jeanne Falconetti’s fidelity to the inexplicable. “Talking to the Whisper,” and Something in the Room She Moves at large, employ a similar lyricism that, like Falconetti’s Joan, evades literal explanation in favor of communion with the sublime.",Experimental,8.0
375,"The New York rapper’s third studio album is an unbothered mission statement that displays his gifts as a bar-for-bar rapper and thrilling genre collagist. Three months after Beyoncé’s Renaissance—and the ensuing conversations about dance music’s mainstream resurgence and its origins in queer, Black spaces—Cakes da Killa released his second album, Svengali. For a technically masterful rapper who has long been celebrated for, and pigeonholed by, his queer, Black identity, it was almost too easy to frame that album’s release as a reaction to the current moment. At the time, Cakes, who was revered for his fusion of ballroom and house influences way before those terms became familiar to the rest of the world, released his most personal and subdued album to date, his trademark made-for-the-catwalk bangers sizzling into more mellow, jazz-influenced musings. But Svengali wasn’t a middle finger to widespread co-optation of his sound; it was simply the album Cakes wanted to, and had to, make. It’s the eternal bind of any trailblazer: You’re either going against the grain or you’re overlooked when your style finally goes big. Lost in this discourse, though, was the simple fact that Cakes da Killa is a really fucking good rapper.Black Sheep, Cakes’ third studio album, acknowledges that lonely position of belonging to no single tribe: too queer for hetero bar-for-bar New York rappers, too much of a rapper for mainstream queer pop. But the album is a confident compendium of breathless performances, bombastic personality, and thrilling genre collages. It is more akin to a victory lap, an unbothered mission statement from someone who knows what he deserves, and who’s going to laugh in your face as he tells you.Born in New Jersey but long claiming New York, Cakes raps with an unmistakable prolonged drawl on his vowels and spits with the confrontational sensibility of early Lil’ Kim. On Black Sheep, he’s wearing those influences clearer than ever, interpolating Wu-Tang Clan and name-dropping Kangols and Mobb Deep’s “Shook Ones, Part II” on closer “Ain’t Shit Sweet.” He channels 1995 hits by LL Cool J and Foxy Brown on standout single “Do Dat Baby,” which features a resplendent Dawn Richard cameo. What separates Cakes from his forebears is, inevitably, who he’s rapping for. “Bump in the cut no K for me/Know a couple they/thems wanna bang my beat,” he opens on “Mind Reader,” a dexterous, soulful cut that is as indebted to Crystal Waters as it is to Remy Ma. The rapping is hard enough for any Hot 97 freestyle: punchlines served one after the other like haymakers; a flow that goes from a speedy whisper to a syncopated bellow in a matter of seconds; and snarling boasts that, even at their most playful, are delivered with ferocious determination and a veteran’s ear for internal rhyme schemes. Who else but Cakes could rap “Shoot your shot while I sip my Riesling/Time to show the girls how to eat in every season”? Who else would admit he’s “too grown to be crushing on a thug” before allowing that he still might let the man top him?",Rap,7.5
376,"This meeting of punk and jazz heavyweights sidesteps contemporary trends; instead we’re treated to four players finding common ground as they slip between genres. As far as meetings between punk elder statesmen and avant-jazz explorers go, the Messthetics and James Brandon Lewis is an intuitive one. Drummer Brendan Canty and bassist Joe Lally, as the rhythm section of Fugazi, had a wide appetite for grooves from outside of hardcore’s pummeling standard vocabulary, whether the half-time sway of reggae or the piston-pumping backbeat of funk. And Lewis, though deeply rooted in jazz tradition, is similarly willing to stray from genre orthodoxy in search of a sound that suits him: The saxophonist’s modern-classic 2016 LP No Filter, full of distorted electric bass and throaty horn lines, has the gleefully pugilistic energy of an all-ages basement show. Lally and Canty formed the Messthetics as an instrumental trio in 2018, filling out the lineup with Anthony Pirog, a left-field jazz guitarist who’s equally adept with sidewinding melody and searing noise, and has worked often with Lewis, including on No Filter. After Lewis sat in with them on a couple of live dates, it must have felt only natural to invite him into the fold for an album.The Messthetics and James Brandon Lewis, which the four men composed collaboratively, sits comfortably apart from any prevailing trends in 2020s jazz: no new-agey ambient soundscapes, cerebral free improvisation, nor incense-and-hand-bells spiritual-jazz revivalism. Its sensibility has a whiff of downtown New York in the freewheeling 1980s and early ’90s, when John Zorn was playing grindcore in Naked City and Sonny Sharrock shared a bassist with Henry Rollins. As in that era of cross-pollination, the players meet each other confidently and generously on their own terms. The punks don’t sound eager to prove their jazz bona fides, and the jazzers don’t seem to view punk with any condescension toward its rudimentary building blocks. Each one brings his particular skill set, and the others figure out how to work with it. The results can be astonishing, as in the climactic final section of “Three Sisters,” when Lewis and Pirog play intertwining solos and the Fugazi guys churn beneath them, each player urging the others toward ever higher flights of intensity and invention.There are also moments that sound more or less like Fugazi with a free-jazz saxophonist instead of a singer. Though they may lack the grand scale of a composition like “Three Sisters,” they ground the album in a sense of boisterous good fun. “Emergence” should be particularly easy for fans of Canty and Lally’s old band to love, with the Messthetics making breakneck switches between “Waiting Room”-style syncopation and pogo-ing power chords, and Lewis blowing like hell on top. Even in his more overtly jazzy work, the saxophonist tends to favor relatively static harmonies over the elaborate chord changes of bebop, an approach that proves a good fit for the lean-and-mean compositional sensibility of a couple of guys schooled on hardcore. With the rest of the band providing such a solid and stripped-down framework, Lewis is free to embellish the melody of “Emergence” in whatever direction he chooses: first straight and declarative, then with increasingly frenetic dissonance as the song goes on.",Rock,7.8
377,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit the Meat Puppets’ 1984 album, a sun-baked, country-fried, acid-addled cowpunk album that could have come from nowhere else but the Arizona desert. On July 8, 1976, a Grumman Goose seaplane refueled at Red Lake, Ontario on its way to the Hudson Bay. The aircraft had trouble staying in the air with the extra fuel—on board were also five people, ten 50-gallon tanks of propane, and a substantial amount of sports fishing equipment. Then, south of Churchill, Manitoba, the left engine stalled. Too heavy to fly with one motor, the plane dropped out of the sky. The wings were cleaved off and the tail twisted upward as it plowed 100 yards through a forest. The pilot broke his knee, but the passengers remained, miraculously, unhurt; they all fled the plane at once, as it now contained a cocktail of propane and gasoline that had been very thoroughly shaken. One of the passengers, a 17-year-old Curt Kirkwood, volunteered to walk to Churchill for help.During that walk, Kirkwood made a decision: He was never going to do anything that he didn’t want to do. What he wanted to do was play guitar in a rock’n’roll band and stay perpetually high. And so he worked hard to make his way from a solidly middle-class upbringing to the margins of society. After graduating from a private Jesuit high school, he dropped out of a private Jesuit university. Then he dropped out of a public university. Then he moved back home to Phoenix, Arizona and worked a series of odd jobs—bussing tables, mowing lawns, driving buses. He quit those one by one, too. Eventually, just as he intended, music was the only avenue left open to him.Kirkwood formed the Meat Puppets in 1980 with his younger brother Cris, an inventive bassist with an incurable coattails complex, and their friend Derrick Bostrom, a drummer who steered the band toward punk rock with his collection of hardcore 7-inches from the burgeoning Los Angeles scene. But the trio’s tastes proved too wide-ranging for the strictly policed boundaries of hardcore; they were just as likely to listen to the Grateful Dead or Lynyrd Skynyrd, Petula Clark or George Jones, Frank Zappa or Captain Beefheart. They bonded over a love of drawing, filling thousands of pages with doodles inspired by Francis Picabia and Vincent van Gogh, Jack Kirby and Walt Disney. They also bonded over drugs, fueling their shared “trip” with mountains of weed, acid, and MDMA.By the early ’80s, the tenets of hardcore had calcified into a strict code of conduct, with pummeling guitars, slam dancing, and shaved heads all de rigueur. On the underground punk circuit, the Meat Puppets’ long hair and psychedelic jamming were widely disdained. It was only a matter of time before the band’s volatile mix of influences would breach containment on Meat Puppets II, a sun-baked, country-fried, acid-addled cowpunk album that could have come from nowhere else but the Arizona desert. With its release in 1984, the Puppets proved that hardcore’s independent network of bands, labels, and venues could be harnessed for much stranger deeds.",Rock,9.0
378,"This newly issued 1971 set helpfully complicates the iconic harpist and pianist’s legacy, revealing her as not just a spiritual-jazz mystic but also the heir to her late husband’s harshly ecstatic fire music. Around 23 minutes into “Africa,” the epic centerpiece of a newly issued 1971 Carnegie Hall concert, Alice Coltrane takes control. Prior to this moment, the performance has featured her exclusively on harp, but for “Africa”—a composition by her late husband John, first released a decade earlier—the bandleader switches to the piano. The rendition takes a winding path, moving through fervent tenor saxophone solos set against a salvo of double drums, a hypnotic percussion break, and two lengthy bass features. Then Alice returns as though banging a gavel, pounding out the bluesy vamp that forms the backbone of the piece and calling the proceedings back to order. Her left hand acts as a booming bass-register engine, while her right answers with meaty chords, echoing the grand big-band orchestration of the 1961 version that led off John’s Africa/Brass LP. As the horns and drums reenter, wailing and exploding around her, she answers with the occasional burst of clanging energy from the keyboard but mostly holds down the center of the music, conveying authority amid the bedlam.There are a lot of reasons to be excited about The Carnegie Hall Concert. It’s only the second full live album in the official Alice Coltrane catalog (an incomplete version of this same Carnegie Hall concert was previously released as a bootleg), and it dates from her most celebrated period as a bandleader, recorded just one week after the release of her acknowledged masterpiece Journey in Satchidananda. It features generously roomy renditions—including versions of two key Journey tracks, each clocking in at more than double the length of the original—that readily transport and at times overwhelm despite the occasionally rough sonics of the source tape. (Sadly, the 4-track master tapes of the concert were lost over the years—“Don’t ask me how,” writes Coltrane’s frequent producer Ed Michel, who oversaw the original Carnegie Hall recording, with palpable frustration in his production notes—so the release is drawn from a 2-track reference mix.)And the album’s supporting cast is extraordinary, bringing together musicians from Journey—Pharoah Sanders on tenor and soprano sax, flute and more, Cecil McBee on bass, and Tulsi Reynolds on tamboura—with bassist Jimmy Garrison, a previous sideman to both Alice and John; Archie Shepp, a collaborator of John’s and, like Sanders, a strongly established saxophonist-bandleader in his own right; dual drummers Ed Blackwell and Clifford Jarvis, the former of whom had joined John on 1960 sessions co-led by Don Cherry; and harmonium player Kumar Kramer.",Jazz,8.4
379,"Carrying forth the Southern sound of Saint Cloud, Katie Crutchfield does it again. Her dazzling, piercing songwriting is perfectly in tune with the band behind her. Before Saint Cloud, the scale of Waxahatchee’s music matched the intimate venues it was often found in—living rooms full of friends, small corner stages, crowded basement venues with iffy plumbing. But on her 2020 album, which Katie Crutchfield recently estimated doubled the size of her audience, she burned the fog off of her arrangements and raised her voice. The sound that emerged was closer in spirit to Americana than late-’90s indie rock.Sometimes background changes can have startling effects: Framed in this light, Crutchfield sounded a bit more like her hero Lucinda Williams, the tang foregrounded in her vocals. More bluntly, she sounded like a “star,” a cheap and transactional term that nonetheless describes a unique phenomenon. There was suddenly miles of space around her, and nowhere else to look but directly into her eyes.Tigers Blood continues the work of clearing room for this new, 8-foot-tall version of Crutchfield. Saint Cloud producer Brad Cook is back, surrounding each instrument with a wooly ball of room tone as substantial as the felt pads of a piano. Crutchfield’s character from Saint Cloud returns, as well, a complicated, warmly combative woman bristling at specific grievances. One of the most indelible hooks on Saint Cloud came from a song called “Hell,” in which Crutchfield sang, “I’ll put you through hell.” Her voice was rueful and affectionate, convincing you both that she did exactly as she said and that for whoever her target was, it was worth it.Joining her this time, on guitars and backup vocals, is the Asheville singer-songwriter MJ Lenderman, whom Crutchfield first invited to contribute to lead single “Right Back to It” and then asked to stay for the duration. You can hear why. Over Phil Cook’s banjo on “Right Back to It,” Lenderman and Crutchfield sound like their own version of Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, lifelong musical partners instead of first-time collaborators. Like most indie rock artists in the 2020s, Lenderman’s music enjoys an easy affinity with roots-rock tempos and temperatures, and his rangy harmonies slot neatly behind Crutchfield’s voice across multiple songs.Most of Tigers Blood is powered by the same roughly strummed acoustic guitar that lit Saint Cloud, with the electric guitars relegated to playing in either soft shuffles or piquant licks. These decorative fills put semicolons, dashes, and full stops on Crutchfield’s endlessly barreling thoughts. Her mind is alive and humming, and her language leaps out at you with its hunger. The repeated refrain of “Bored”—a song about trying and failing to keep yourself still—is, simply, “I get bored.” But the way Crutchfield sings the words sounds like a death sentence, and it’s the only moment across Tigers Blood’s 12 songs where that warm voice constricts and turns thin with fear.",Rock,8.8
380,"The Scottish noise-pop legends’ second album since reuniting strikes a reflective, unusually congenial tone, paying tribute to rock history and their place within it. Since their landmark 1985 debut Psychocandy, the Jesus and Mary Chain thrived on the familial tension between William and Jim Reid, the brothers at the heart of the band. The friction that spurred their artistry during their heyday ultimately proved to be their undoing, culminating in a notorious onstage implosion at the House of Blues Los Angeles in September 1998. The Reids finally immortalize that incident in “jamcod,” the first single from Glasgow Eyes, an album that answers the question: What would a harmonious Jesus and Mary Chain sound like?Glasgow Eyes is only the second album of new material the band has released since reuniting in 2007. After nearly a decade apart, the Reids mended fences so they could headline Coachella, then spent another 10 years figuring out how to move forward as a creative unit. They reemerged in 2017 with Damage and Joy, co-produced with Youth, whom the Reids hired because they believed they might need a mediator. Damage and Joy offered a spruced-up spin on the JAMC’s signature blend of rock sleaze and dreamy drones—evidence the group could still deliver new material yet suggesting they could be in danger of recycling past ideas. The Reid brothers opted to push back against looming stagnation by producing Glasgow Eyes themselves, revitalizing their rock’n’roll by focusing on synthesizers, not stompboxes.Electronics always have lurked within the Jesus and Mary Chain’s sound, shaping the rhythms of Darklands and accentuating the ominous, saturated hues of Automatic. Glasgow Eyes flips the emphasis: synths often take center stage, leaving guitars as either punctuation or texture. The shift in direction is evident from the moment “Venal Joy” kicks off in a whirring squall of electronics underpinned by primitive sequenced drums. “Venal Joy” is insistent but not combative, demonstrating the Jesus and Mary Chain’s ability to bend old-school synths so they sound like the noise-pop that is their stock in trade.They spend much of Glasgow Eyes pursuing retro electronics to a logical conclusion. Whether it’s the sneering “American Born” or chilled-out thrum of “Discotheque,” the group winds up playing murky new wave that walks the line between homage and satire. A few pointed exceptions arrive during the duo’s strolls through rock’s back pages. “Hey Lou Reid” is split between fuzz-toned garage and oceanic waves of strums—the two sides of the Velvet Underground combined in salute—and “The Eagles and the Beatles” is propelled by a riff that purposely nods at “I Love Rock ’n Roll,” the Arrows glam-rocker that Joan Jett & the Blackhearts turned into a standard in 1981 (not to be confused with JAMC’s own “I Love Rock ’n’ Roll,” which opened their 1998 album Munki).",Rock,6.5
381,"The Atlanta rapper’s latest imagines a higher dimension where outré flexes and endless love affairs are enveloped by waves of metallic crunch and mind-expanding guitar. From the time she was 16, Bktherula has claimed to exist at what she calls Level 5. The Atlanta rapper The Face she gave a name to this “egoless” space above the third and fourth dimensions as she was graduating high school; to her, it’s a plane where clout-chasing and self-doubt give way to creative freedom. Since then, she’s made her own name by chiseling aspects of trap, rage, plugg, and bubbly SoundCloud sing-song rap into jagged, psychedelic hedonism. On the average Bk track, ideas flail like neon-colored bike tassels—she can roar about stealing your girl over drums and sirens one minute and sing about relationship problems over Mac DeMarco samples the next. Individual moments are thrilling and unpredictable, though early full-lengths like 2020’s Love Santana occasionally veered off course. Every subsequent Bk album has worked to plant her songs on sturdier ground. On her latest project, LVL5 P2—the second in a series that started last year—Bk imagines a fifth dimension where outré flexes and endless love affairs are enveloped by waves of metallic crunch and mind-expanding guitar.P2 ups the ante by nudging Bk further toward popular sounds without diluting her live-wire spark. For every romantically wounded interstellar croon session like “Just Make Sure” or “The Way,” there are prickly digital slappers like opener “Code” or “Tatti,” where the boasts are outlandish (“We don’t ride with the stick, we are the stick, we livin’ scarecrow”) and no one’s girl is immune from Bk’s FaceTime call. A foray into the world of sexy drill on “Shakin It,” complete with an airy beat and feature by New York maverick Cash Cobain, makes perfect sense: The duo are essentially trying to out-horny each other. Late-album cut “Woman” is less successful, trying on producer Azure’s buzzy synths and drums and coming up as a colorless drag. It’s a shame because Bk’s kiss-offs to an ex who hears her song every time they turn on NBA 2K are snappy, but the delivery and plodding beat stymie her and guest JID’s verses.Bk’s writing has become slightly stickier and more memorable since the “Lightweight” and “Faygo” days in 2018, but her songs rise and fall on the flows, ad-libs, and delivery. “Inasne” is built on clichés (money, drugs, women, day ones), but it works thanks to the technicolor bounce of AyeLavish’s beat and Bk’s bunny-hop cadence. It may feel like Carti homage on the surface, but the contrast between the fluctuating melodies and deadpan ad-libs sends the song swinging down to Earth and back up to the stratosphere. Little details like these—Bk racing a half-measure ahead of the beat on “Boi,” the Juvenile-indebted hook on “Tatti,” the way her voice blends with longtime collaborator SimmyAuto’s zig-zagging 808s on “Wishuwasdacrew”—are old tricks that still work wonders. Sometimes, like on “Feathers,” the gambit works a bit too well, rendering Bk as background noise on her own song.But LVL5 P2’s hits outweigh the misses. Bk’s style has evolved a lot from the minimal, spacey thumpers that established her SoundCloud presence, and she’s spent her tenure at Warner flirting with more palatable textures without sanding down her edges too much. And while not every experiment bears fruit, it never feels like she’s being forced where she doesn’t fit. Bk may not have it fully figured out yet as far as albums are concerned, but P2’s ambition is potent enough to cause a contact high.Correction: Bktherula is from Atlanta, not North Carolina. This review has been updated.",Rap,7.1
382,"Recorded straight to tape with a small group of close confidants, the Big Thief singer’s latest solo album is free-flowing and intuitive, reveling in the space between spontaneity and impermanence. Two songs on Adrianne Lenker’s Bright Future begin with the woosh of a tape machine settling into its correct speed. The players sometimes murmur among themselves as a song gets going or winds down; Lenker’s voice occasionally grows distant, as though she were turning away from the mic, then rises in volume as she leans forward again. At first blush, these audible moments of calibration signal a certain old-school authenticity. The Big Thief singer-songwriter cut her new album straight to tape, just like the last one, and it has the air of an unadulterated document of the music as it was performed in the studio.Beneath the surface, these effects suggest a more complex relationship between the recording and the music, drawing attention to the artifice and happenstance of what we’re hearing. By demonstrating so explicitly that this is how the music sounded in this room, on this day, they’re also implying that it might have sounded quite different in another place, another time. The musicians play wispy outlines of folk rock, giving just as much attention to the negative spaces as the notes you actually hear. The aesthetic suits the material. Lenker’s songs find beauty in the attempt to give memory solid shape: to hold it in one’s palms like a wounded bird that sat still when the others flew away, and coax it with a sweet melody into sticking around a while longer. Bright Future is like an attempt to hold the memories of the songs themselves, to stop their wild wings from beating for a moment and get a good look before they vanish in the air.For all the shaggy-dog presentation of her main band, Lenker often approaches her songs with disciplined attention to form and economy, but opener “Real House” is something different. Its chords float along without clear paths of tension and release; its lyrics are associative rather than linear. In the second verse, a surreal image stands in for feelings not yet addressed directly: “Stars shine like tears on the night’s face.” Eventually, the song reveals its subject as Lenker’s mother, and the fog of ambiguity around the preceding lyrics begins to clear. By the final lines, a devastating recounting of the first time Lenker saw her cry, we’ve moved wholly out of the spectral realm and into everyday heartbreak.Lenker recorded Bright Future with accompaniment from Philip Weinrobe, her engineer and co-producer, as well as singer-songwriter and frequent Big Thief collaborator Mat Davidson, violinist and percussionist Josefin Runsteen, and alt-R&B auteur Nick Hakim. They did a lot of passing around instruments: The album’s basic palette is voice, guitar, piano, and violin, each of which is credited to at least two different performers at various points. (Runsteen and Lenker’s brother Noah also play occasional percussion.) The free-flowing and intuitive nature of the sessions is apparent in the recordings, which have the amiable looseness of first takes. You get the sense, sometimes, that they are figuring out a song’s ideal arrangement as they track it.",Rock,8.4
383,"These whimsical, at times absurdist songs from the former Lounge Lizard’s gently quixotic HBO series seem designed to channel the beautiful weirdness at the heart of the human experience. “Old Man Dancing,” number 18 on the 56-track double album Painting With John: Music from the Series by John Lurie, opens with John Lurie exhorting listeners to get moving. “Dance like no one is watching,” he beseeches over funk guitar and saucy horns, winking at the inspirational adage. “Even if you have a show on HBO!”“Old Man Dancing” shares its title with an episode of Painting With John, a meditative and beautiful series that blended Lurie’s exceptional talent for storytelling with close-ups of his brushstrokes as he painted watercolors, along with the occasional surrealist skit. On the show, the song accompanies images of Lurie in basketball shorts and a tank top, dancing on a rock in the sun, flapping his arms between camera pans to his black sneakers. (In the same episode, he tells a story about scoring a Barney’s commercial for Glenn O’Brien, while drawing a bird with a fountain pen.) Was the song born first, or the scene? It doesn’t matter—the meta nature of the whole project underscores that to Lurie, the lines between each medium are porous. This might lend the album a self-referential quality for devotees of the show, but on its own it translates to a lovely and sprawling collection of intrepid banjo and deep-groove polyrhythms full of the spontaneity and deadpan humor that have defined Lurie’s work since he taught himself to play harmonica in the late 1960s.Lurie is perhaps best known as the saxophonist of the Lounge Lizards, the experimental group that was active from 1978 to the end of the 20th century, and which he forged in downtown New York when living downtown in New York still meant something. Lurie has also, simultaneously, been an actor, visual artist, film scorer, and author—his 2021 book, The History of Bones, is one of the best-written musical memoirs I’ve read—and in 1991 created Fishing With John, the cult show in which Lurie took guests like Tom Waits and Dennis Hopper out on the water. Painting With John, which unfortunately ended in 2023, after just three seasons, was a slightly more hermetic show than its predecessor, though no less generous or ingenious. Much of its appeal was its fluent, often surprising soundtrack, and its portrayal of the way Lurie's life has shifted in recent years. Diagnosed with Lyme disease and then cancer, Lurie relocated to an undisclosed island in the Caribbean to reconstitute. He was unable to play music for a time. Now 72, he seems to think of this release as punctuation: In press materials, he said that the Painting With John music “may be the last thing I do. I want it to be beautiful.”",Experimental,8.0
384,"This shadowy collective’s debut album is as nebulous as its members’ identities. An amorphous mixture of guitars, electronics, and wispy vocals, it mimics the blurriness of a dream. Can you really proclaim yourself a “supergroup” when all your members are anonymous? On Princ​€​ss’ self-titled debut, the mysterious collective teases us with this question. Going purely off their nebulous music, one could start to draw any number of guesses: Could this be the result of a one-off power trio of Tirzah, ML Buch, and Mica Levi? Or a hazy bedroom jam session helmed by Lolina and Astrid Sonne? Perhaps it’s merely a family affair from the label it emerged from, Dublin’s wherethetimegoes, which over a series of low-key releases has documented the myriad experimental sounds germinating across the city. Dabbling in disembodied drill, cloudy laptop pop, shapeless dream folk, and iridescent organ drones, the label has staged a quiet rebellion against its city’s reputation for raucous punk bands and pubs overflowing with Celtic fiddle music vying to appease the tourists.However this enigmatic collaboration came to be, the music itself feels like an amalgamation—a mutant, multi-headed half-band frozen midway through evolution. Chorus-soaked guitars seep into buzzing string drones, while vocalists seem to come and go at their leisure, sometimes appearing so distant in the mix you’ll question if you actually heard them or not. It flows with the blurry logic of a dream, yet Princ​€​ss’ hypnagogia isn’t exactly nocturnal, but shimmering and bright, more a blinding desert mirage than a foggy city street. The claustrophobic, field-recording-like nature of the mixing makes the whole thing sound as if you’re hearing it from inside your phone, yet its disconnected loose ends still give it an expansive quality that billows like a slowly shape-shifting cloud.Though Princ​€​ss occasionally flirt with more traditional song structures, rolling out echoing shoegaze guitars, those chords and vocals feel like just small pieces of the puzzle. Such seemingly song-like forms are eventually overtaken by smaller details: In “Point of View,” it’s a distorted pulse that emerges halfway through, pulling the rest of the track into its digital mulcher. On “Sometimes,” the singer’s sparse vocals and a wilted guitar line sway back and forth until a sighing synthetic tone emerges, washing everything out like an engine releasing steam. Instruments constantly seem to be breaking down; the spindling harp melody of “Hoist Point” practically collapses beneath the overblown sound of a creaking cello, until that too becomes eclipsed by a silvery ticking rhythm like coins clinking together.Rather than tearing itself apart, however, Princ​€​ss’ debut moves with a remarkable, slippery unity. “Crying” opens the record with a heaving, churning mass of strings, while quieter moments like “Wow” draw a peaceful bath of swirling, washed-out synths. It’s hard to pin down much about Princ​€​ss, but their music speaks to a sense of absence. As a “band,” they seem to lie at the very edge of whatever the term might mean these days. Guitars bleed into plastic loops, songs disintegrate into formless electronic dust, and traditional instruments are subsumed into a wall of hypnotic feedback. Princ​€​ss’ debut asks a lot of questions, but in refusing to answer any of them, they instead leave us floating, unresolved, and in between.",Experimental,7.6
385,"The Massachusetts-raised singer-songwriter’s second album exudes a quiet intensity, slipping between gentle indie rock and barely-there folk songs with bottomless vulnerability. There’s no two ways about it: At times, Haux sounds a lot like Bon Iver. The similarity goes deeper than their shared approach to granularly detailed electronic pop, falsetto vocals, and sunken guitars; you might find yourself double-checking Spotify, wondering if somewhere, Justin Vernon’s broken angel wings are twitching. To Vern out this hard and then call a song “Hazel” almost begs for the association. Nevertheless, on Blue Angeles, as on his 2020 debut LP, Woodson Black has an otherworldly way of making an ordinary song his own.That first album, Violence in a Quiet Mind, is remarkable for its unshelled vulnerability. It’s music you hover over, cupping your hands around it like a candle flame you have to shield from the wind. Isolation and depression are its themes; it leaves a pale scar on Blue Angeles in the barely-there folk of “Bella Blue.” But the new LP is cast as an escape from Los Angeles on the Appalachian Trail, breathing with more fresh air, natural light, and inertial energy than its superbly introverted predecessor. It’s this diurnal energy that draws out some glaring comparisons, but Black’s own fingerprints are all over them.Blue Angeles is an album of indie rock and folk songs done up in pop, with deliriously driving basslines, precise pauses and drops, and deep DAW dives that dredge up strange volumes and curves in heartfelt, straightforward melodies. The production zings with hyperreal shudders and swooshes; stray syllables are tweezed off and blasted with freezing ethers, then left to shiver in digital limbos. The songs wax in emotion by waning in intensity, as Black’s flute-like voice slips down long, cool, fluid corridors.Outside of well-turned but more commonplace fare like “Hazel,” “Carte Blanche,” and “Claire De Lune,” things get weirder and more interesting; a certain Old Hollywood glamour keeps casting a shadow through all the partly sunny weather. “Cover Girl” revels in raw earnestness and plush staging, sampling a classic Rita Hayworth film noir in an eerie lullaby adorned with iridescent harps. It sounds like Broken Social Scene’s “Anthems for a Seventeen-Year-Old Girl” crossed with the Smashing Pumpkins deep cut “Cupid de Locke.” “Blood Moon” might have been at home on the first album, which resonated with the smallest, most cowering songs of Xiu Xiu, where the singing sounds like a weeping cartoon mouse. “Waves” is a convincing throwback to early James Blake, all loosened virtual drumheads and sewing-machine percussion, even though there’s a questionable Post Malone-y part stashed a little sneakily at the end.Blue Angeles is seamlessly designed, except when it pointedly chooses not to be; across the record, there is a tendency to paste up flawless fantasies and then rip them down. When things start to feel too perfect, too professional, too cinematic, a plain acoustic guitar will shred the patina, or perhaps a brief recording of a roller coaster will zoom through a solemn anthem. On one song, a friend named Crow gives a homily about the earth; on another, he improvises on the harmonica. It resembles a light afternoon nap, when the world starts to filter into dreams. If the tentative daybreak of this album is slightly less unique than the prior record’s bottomless night, it’s just as casually gorgeous and finely shaded.",Folk,7.5
386,"The pop star’s latest is less of a faceplant than a comfortable rehash of past glories. He scales his stuttering electro and squelchy ’80s funk into hollow, expensive-sounding maximalism. Y2K is back and Justin Timberlake is the asterisk in the trend report, left in the dirt like skinny scarves and fedoras. The ex-*NSYNC singer’s stuttering electro-pop, kissed with silky millennium-era R&B, produced at least one all-time album with 2006’s FutureSex/LoveSounds. But after a decade of borderline unlistenable music, hindsight suggests that despite his talents as a performer, Timberlake was also simply in the right place at the right time to benefit from Timbaland’s mid-’00s hot streak, or snag the Michael Jackson rejects that made up his 2002 debut Justified.Timberlake’s sixth album, Everything I Thought It Was, is designed to buff the dents out of his public image in the wake of a recent memoir by his ex-girlfriend, Britney Spears. She wrote that he encouraged her to get an abortion, told the media she was a “cheating slut and a liar,” and generally acted even worse than you might imagine from a cornrowed white dude who’s prone to speak in AAVE. In an interview to promote the album’s lead single “Selfish,” a wispy mea culpa directed to “the owner of my heart and all my scars,” aka his wife of 12 years Jessica Biel, Timberlake spoke admiringly of music that lays male emotions bare. Referencing Donny Hathaway’s cover of “Jealous Guy,” he told Zane Lowe, “You just don’t hear that from men often, that they would express an emotion that makes them vulnerable. Growing up the way I grew up, you’re kind of taught not to do that.”Timberlake’s read on contemporary pop could have been true half a decade ago, but today’s radio airwaves are full of men talking about feelings, and the biggest songs last year from male artists were yearning country ballads. No one really wants to hear about gender from an artist who saw fit to name a 2013 single “Take Back the Night,” but softboy masculinity is a useful touchstone for an artist embarking on a redemption arc. Listening to his new album makes it all feel about as convincing as the rootsy pose he struck on 2018’s Man of the Woods, an album for the hypebeast whose hiking boots have never seen soil.At 77 minutes, the mercilessly unhurried Everything I Thought It Was does everything you thought Justin Timberlake did but worse. Contrary to the story he told Lowe, the album stops short of meaningfully grappling with his past, offering a lily pad for rote, randy showmanship. “Flame” shoots for the cinematic swoop of “What Goes Around…Comes Around” but trades the intricacy of FutureSex/LoveSounds’ karmic ballet for smooth radio piano, soundbank samples of siren wails, and arson metaphors piled like dusty coals that are never going to take. By the end of the song you’re begging for something, anything to jolt the song’s eight producers out of bird-feeding Timberlake’s former triumphs back to you.",Pop,4.9
387,"Back from pandemic-induced hiatus, the Florida-based band fuses urgent post-hardcore with softer strains of shoegaze and grunge to unlock a new power of restraint. Gouge Away’s new album is a resurrection. Since forming in Fort Lauderdale in the early 2010s, the quartet has generated throat-mulching noise rock and shattered fragments of hardcore, imbuing every note with an intensity that felt impressively unsustainable—like the sound of a band destined to burn out and implode sooner rather than later. Their first album was titled , Dies, like a clause in the headline of a newspaper obituary: It seemed to suggest they were doomed from the start.When the onset of the pandemic forced the band to pause writing its third album, Deep Sage, the gloomy prophecy nearly came true. Vocalist Christina Michelle stepped back from the band to “focus on [her] personal life” and moved to Portland, Oregon. Other bandmates departed Florida for different parts of the country and began to accept that their songs-in-progress might never see the light of day.But as time passed, absence and distance papered over old disagreements and Gouge Away found that they missed each other. In 2022, they revisited the dormant project with fresh eyes—eager again to make something that felt new. The resulting songs are daringly restrained for a band best known for its frayed emotions and unrelenting extremity. These qualities are present in Deep Sage, but the new album also exhibits striking contrasts, embracing relatively softer, melodic sounds—gravity-defying shoegaze, gloomy grunge—alongside the urgent post-hardcore refractions Gouge Away have offered since their earliest days.Their 2018 record Burnt Sugar—recorded with Jeremy Bolm (of Touché Amoré) and Jack Shirley (who’s produced for Deafheaven, Loma Prieta, and more)—represented the band’s first attempt to weave these more sedate sounds into desperate, distressed songs. Deep Sage, recorded again with Shirley, digs deeper to explore sounds that previous work only hinted at. There are songs like “Idealized,” where the melodies wriggle and squirm like the off-balance ’90s post-hardcore collected in Numero Group box sets. The stumbling, blistering “Newtau” recalls the labyrinthine riffs of David Pajo, if he were recording in an active blast furnace. Closer “Dallas,” a loving tribute to a lost friend, churns through the foamy melodies of lower-fi shoegaze, allowing space for Michelle’s voice to fall to a delicate hush instead of her usual pinched scream.When heavy bands branch out, it sometimes comes at the expense of their previous crushing chaos, but Gouge Away pursue new directions primarily in service of increasing their overall intensity. When they launch into the seasick hardcore riffs of “Spaced Out” or the queasy AmRep fuzz of “The Sharpening” (which features some of Michelle’s most unsettled vocals across any of the bands’ records to date) the impact is felt more directly because of the quieter moments: Each of Michelle’s shredded screams arrives with the hair-raising jolt of a jump scare. It's a new trick for Gouge Away, and an effective one—they force you to let your guard down for a moment, and then they shove your face straight back into the concrete.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

388,"On the deluxe version of its debut full-length, the trio struggles to find a middle ground between treacly verses and the bubbly pop-rap they’re known for. California trio grouptherapy. is a product of a particular model of young stardom. Growing up, Tyrel J. “TJOnline” Williams and Coy “SWIM” Stewart appeared on every network and streaming service, from Disney Channel to Nickelodeon to Netflix. Around the same time, Jadagrace featured in 2009’s Terminator: Salvation, had her own TV show, and signed a major-label record deal, all before she started high school. In another era, they might’ve been forced into an ensemble by executives looking to milk the cable-TV-to-pop-star pipeline that birthed Miley Cyrus or Zendaya. Instead, the self-described artist collective first became friends on the audition circuit as kids, bonding over a love for music that pushed them away from the unforgiving and dangerous world of child acting (not that the music industry is much better). grouptherapy. began as three Black misfits making music for themselves and now they’re bringing their genre-straddling music to the world on their terms. There’s a wide-eyed fascination with every sound they dabble in; they sound like giddy theater kids after their first experience with a Tyler, the Creator or BROCKHAMPTON album.That isn’t to say grouptherapy.’s members are lacking in skill. Their flows are malleable and energetic, but even their best songs have a summer-camp-talent-show quality to them. Take “American Psycho,” the second track on their debut album i was mature for my age, but i was still a child. Over reverb-drenched guitars and Jada’s background growls, TJ and SWIM vent about mental health issues, the corrupting power of money, and being bullied for being Black and queer. What’s supposed to be honest and raw instead feels overly earnest and chintzy. TJ’s verse in particular sounds like a rejected draft from the Saturation III sessions: “I hate niggas ’cause the niggas hate me right on back/I hate hoes ’cause they never wanna see me relax/And it’s not a ho in the sense of having a pussy/But tryna pull the pussy outta me, tryna challenge me.” mature, and its deluxe edition THE ADDENDUM, struggle to find a middle ground between treacly writing and the bubbly pop-rap they’ve made their name on.The most notable change from earlier projects is a more expansive ear for beats. Both 2020’s there goes the neighborhood and 2022’s Truth Be Told had more uniform production aesthetics, but mature speeds through so many different styles of rap, it often feels overwhelming. Looking for bars over melancholy piano, cribbed straight from the Saba playbook? “smiles :)” has you covered. What about pastiches of Beyoncé’s “PURE/HONEY” or the deadpan hilarity of Rio Da Yung OG-style Michigan street rap? Try “Lightspeed ~>” or TJ’s closing verse on “Nasty.” There are attempts at drum’n’bass (“HOT!”), boom-bap (“Help Pt. 2”), and pluggnB (“GT.”), which strain to illustrate grouptherapy.’s versatility. It’s all serviceable, polished, and competently performed, but it often doesn’t stick; the stuff that does just leaves you wanting more of the trio’s eccentricities, as opposed to what’s currently on their playlist. Outside of critiques of consumer culture that frequently veer toward the contradictory (stating that the impulse to flex “isn’t healthy” on “Help Pt. 1” before claiming to speak “billion-dollar banter” two tracks later on “FUNKFEST”), there’s little that’s refreshing here. We’re left with formless variety, ideas with no spine fusing them together.Still, grouptherapy.’s enthusiasm can be infectious from time to time, especially on the songs where they cut loose and just bar out. The peppy sing-raps on “thatsmycheck.” and the Memphis crunk-style chants that power the hook for “DYSBF!” help their respective songs crackle and pop (Jada’s fiery verse on “thatsmycheck.” is also one of the funniest and most amped on the album.) This energy goes further on ADDENDUM’s seven extra songs, which are generally less self-serious. Tracks like “Home Alone” and “thank u so much” are breezy and effortless, the trio’s personalities popping as they trade jokes and off-kilter flexes about not having taken the SATs. These details are way more endearing than moments like “still alive,” which sullies the delicate immersion into the group’s backstories with plodding keyboards and vocal harmonies that even Chance the Rapper would find too syrupy. grouptherapy.’s current sound isn’t sprawling in an Odd Future or Tierra Whack sense; it’s just unwieldy. With some more work, they could one day find themselves on similarly hallowed ground as their various influences. For now, they still have some growing up to do.",Rap,5.8
389,"Capping off the Ho trilogy, Flo Milli flexes and shines on some of her best songs yet, even if the album is a little uneven. Who knows what this album would’ve sounded like if Flo Milli hadn’t posted that TikTok last September, fanning out a stack of bills in a sparsely appointed condo, grills glinting as she rapped: “He speed in the Wraith while his hand on my coochie/He touching Emilio Pucci.”Flo had already released one single, “Fruit Loop,” with another, “Chocolate Rain,” set to drop that week. Those two songs, along with the October single “BGC,” were produced by the up-and-coming Young Fyre, who had previously co-produced Flo’s vindictively bratty bop “Conceited.” According to an interview with Rolling Stone last year, Fyre produced at least 10 tracks for Flo’s “vulnerable” follow-up to 2022’s You Still Here, Ho?None of those songs appear on Fine Ho, Stay. It’s easy to imagine how the viral success of “Never Lose Me” might have upended the Alabama rapper’s rollout—picture a mid-level label manager breathlessly recounting the metrics to her team, previously closed budgets suddenly reopening. Fine Ho, Stay is accordingly expensive, laced with beats by established hitmakers like Bangladesh, ATL Jacob, and Lex Luger, and offers some of Flo’s best songs yet. It’s a worthy closer to the trilogy set off by 2020’s Ho, why is you here ?, but it’s hard to shake the sensation that Flo Milli can make a better album than this.That’s mostly thanks to Flo Milli herself, whose nimble flows curl anodyne ideas into pleasingly irregular shapes. On “Edible,” a particularly gifted lover doesn’t make Flo feel perfect or flawless, but “impeccable”; the strobing start-stop of “Tell Me What You Want” will likely leave you muttering “Men like to talk and I hate it” for weeks. Her syncopated flows handspring and pitter-patter towards vivid phrases and sticky earworms, as on the double-dutch trap anthem “Got the Juice,” where Flo alternates hot and cold: “I’m so confusing, he can’t tell if I’m in love or if I’m using/I just lost my eater damn, let’s get to recruiting.”Speaking of eaters, Fine Ho, Stay is almost exclusively focused on sexual competition. Milli still flexes the karats in her watch and a minor caravan of luxury vehicles, but she’s more concerned with her harem, in particular the assets they offer—cash, comfort, cunnilingus. On “Neva,” Flo makes “a rich nigga go broke”; on “New Me,” she sizes up the guy’s whole friend group to make sure she fucks the hottest one. The hoes bear few to no distinguishing traits, a cast of NPCs who exist solely to confirm the intensity of Milli’s sex appeal.",Rap,7.0
390,"Despite its jacked-up end-times framing, the former Majical Cloudz singer’s third solo album mostly hews to the melancholy synth pop and emotional interrogations of his previous solo work. There’s no better time than the apocalypse to get jacked. That’s the none-too-subtle takeaway from the presentation of Devon Welsh’s third solo album, the threateningly titled Come With Me If You Want to Live. Welsh is lifting weights in every press photo; the garish album art exaggerates his muscles even further; the only thing in the way of a bio is a short story written by Welsh from the perspective of a journalist being shepherded around a hellscape called America 2 by a writer using the alias Max Paragon that looks like “Rambo meets Arnold, with a dash of Houdini.” Pre-release singles “You Can Do Anything” and “That’s What We Needed” mirror this burly chaos; their thunderous breakbeats are easily the loudest drums Welsh has ever sung over. But beyond the imagery, the imagined backstory, and those two singles, Come With Me If You Want to Live is a far less aggressive listen than it might seem, one that remains squarely within Welsh’s wheelhouse.As the vocalist of the now-defunct project Majical Cloudz, Welsh radiated a deadly seriousness amid the duo’s lush, ambient-inspired soundscapes. “I’ve always dealt with revealing myself, and intimacy, and trusting people,” he said in a 2015 Pitchfork cover story. “It’s scary shedding those layers and saying, ‘This is who I am, this is how I feel.’” On the surface, Come With Me If You Want to Live’s thematic underpinnings suggest a departure from the brutally honest, autobiographical mode that persisted on Welsh’s previous solo outings, but his depictions of the end times—set to plaintive synth pop and dramatic, reverb-soaked vocals—still favor the hyper-personal, even the mundane.The album’s lyrics are predominantly directed at friends and family, treating the wreckage outside less as an excuse to make sweeping declarations about the state of the world than a final chance to say what needs to be said to the people that matter most. There are songs titled “Brother” and “Sister.” “Before the Moon Was Full” is a misty-eyed, fatalistic look back at a romance that bloomed before the shit hit the fan. “Best Laid Plans” addresses Welsh’s late father: “Hey man I’d really love to see you/I feel so far away from you/I really miss you.” Even the angrier-sounding singles revolve around calls to action to those close to Welsh: “You Can Do Anything” argues for shrugging off the shackles of societal pressures, and “That’s What We Needed” advocates for stewing in your feelings.Welsh kicked off his solo career with 2018’s Dream Songs, an album built around string-heavy live instrumentation provided by multiple collaborators, which starkly contrasted with Majical Cloudz’s spartan, synth-heavy palette. The following year’s True Love reverted back to the mean, and despite the aforementioned breakbeats, the bulk of Come With Me If You Want to Live could also be easily mistaken for Majical Cloudz material. As on True Love, Welsh is largely left to his own devices, with his plaintive baritone and penchant for moody atmospheres suggesting John Cale recording an album inspired by the Blue Nile’s late-night masterpiece Hats. The meditative second half of the album treats percussion as a form of sketchwork rather than a propulsive backbone, and wispy, reverb-laden synths serve as the sole melodic accompaniment to Welsh’s straight-faced vocals.",Electronic,6.8
391,"The “Get in With Me” rapper’s single-minded focus on getting money and spending it irresponsibly is a perfect distraction from the precarity of real life. BossMan Dlow’s dope-dealing motivation rap exploded at exactly the right moment. Inflation is everywhere. Trips to the grocery store are backbreaking. Jobs would rather lay off workers than give them a couple extra dollars. Turn on the TV or go on social media and it feels like everyone is getting money but you. With these very real anxieties in the air, Dlow’s reckless, turnt-up anthems about chasing the bag and upgrading your lifestyle can feel damn near spiritual.That was the case with “Get in With Me,” his January single that went from regional Florida rap barnburner to viral sensation and nationwide hit, mostly because he sounds like a life coach: “You wanna boss up your life? All you gotta do is get in with me.” This February, I was in Phoenix with a few friends for a wedding, and the nickel-and-diming of travel had worn us down. After a night at the club spent slow-sipping drinks to stretch our thin wallets, “Get in With Me” came on the radio during the drive home. We blasted his vivid imagery of jewelry, sports cars, and hibachi restaurant dinners and for a few minutes, we felt rich as hell.“Get in With Me” is the lead single on Mr Beat the Road, the Port Salerno-bred rapper’s first mixtape since entering the mainstream fold. At 17 tracks, it’s a pedal-to-the-metal blur of hustler’s ambition and fantasies about all the irresponsible shit you can do with too much money. Dlow is not a versatile rapper. The Michigan-meets-the-South party beats are formulaic and his one-note celebratory punch-ins mean that the mixtape is full of lesser variants of “Get in With Me.” The good news is that “Get in With Me” is such a shot of adrenaline that even B-tier versions of it still make you want to act a fool.When Mr Beat the Road brings to mind the grind and glory of Southern rap albums of the past, it’s not the emotionally complex ones that sound as if they’ve survived war, like Jeezy’s TM101 or Webbie’s Savage Life, but the hard-earned flash and opulence of a Big Tymers project. In that duo, Birdman and Mannie Fresh were two limited rappers getting by on swag and embellishment, with a deadeye focus on all the rims and chains their years of grueling work had gotten them, rather than the work itself. Mr Beat the Road is pretty similar. The recurring background sounds of scraped pots, flickering burners, and rubber on pavement remind you of the hustle, but mostly Dlow’s having a good-ass time. His greatest attribute is that he can’t wait to tell you how large he’s living, an excitement so contagious that rapping along feels like part of the experience.",Rap,7.0
392,"Five years after her brief but spectacular debut, Tierra Whack digs deep into her psyche for an anxious, dark, and raw follow-up. She remains a magnetic performer even if the music has lost some of its color. Content warning: This review mentions self-harm and suicidal ideation.On her 2018 short-film-as-album Whack World, Tierra Whack introduced the world to a cartoon version of herself. Her grief, romance, and existential crises were simplified and exaggerated into bite-sized rap songs with bold visuals that were part Adult Swim, part Pee-wee’s Playhouse. She didn’t shy away from pain but transmuted it into things like dogs and chicken wings. Reflected through her prismatic lens, her interior world felt surreal, and entirely her own. In contrast, the pain coursing through World Wide Whack feels like a real-life remake of the original animated movie. The record’s extended runtime allows a deeper look into Whack’s head as she tackles depression and anxiety in a straightforward, moving, and darkly funny way. But while her commitment to simplicity lends itself to a big emotional catharsis, you can’t help but feel some of her music has lost some of its color.Fragments of Whack World can be found in the production, which is spare but encompasses a wide range of genres, from Atlanta trap to Casio-preset funk to pop ballads to her signature singsongy nursery rap. The spaciousness and austerity of the beats allow Whack’s voice to take the spotlight. She has a lot of fun modulating her pitch, tone, and accent like she’s a teenager playing dress-up at the mall. On “Chanel Pit” alone, she shifts between staccato and vibrato singing, explosive bursts in the verse and cool restraint in the chorus. As much as World Wide Whack aims to be still and real, there is still much character in her delivery.Even though the songs are epics by Whack standards—almost every song still clocks in under three minutes—this album shares some of Whack World’s ephemerality in the sheer randomness of cuts like “Shower Song,” which does what it says on the tin (“Soap and water give me powers”), and “Moovies,” a disarmingly simple track about wanting to be treated to dinner and a show. The songs are fun, but they feel less exploratory and more like a concession to the market of likes and “For-You” pages. She’s at her most magnetic when she loosens her grip on her idiosyncrasies and tries on other people’s flows, like when she adds a little Ice Spice flippancy to a relationship post-mortem on “X” (“Just like a website, he beggin’ to link, I went to his house and sofa was stink”) or channels throwback Migos, ad-libs and all, on “Snake Eyes.”",Rap,7.3
393,"Continuing his impressive run, MIKE links with the Brooklyn producer for a deliriously fun record of low-stakes raps and bubbly beats. It’s the most energetic project the rapper’s ever made, an unexpected but welcome vibe change. MIKE’s been stepping out from the shadows lately. For years, he’s trafficked in a faded photograph sound, his rich baritone melting into beats that could disintegrate if you held them too long. His gluey flow often obscures the beauty of his lyrics, which can move from self-examination to nostalgia to empowerment within a few seconds. But beginning with 2022’s Beware of the Monkey, MIKE started to pry the boards off the windows, illuminating the darker corners of his work. Faith is a Rock, a contemplative collaboration with Wiki and the Alchemist, dropped less than a year later, and shone with the clarity of a bright winter’s morning. Three weeks after that, MIKE released Burning Desire, a meticulously crafted opus that signaled MIKE had fully entered his charged-up era. Now, continuing his impressive run, he teams up with Brooklyn producer Tony Seltzer for Pinball, a deliriously fun record of low-stakes raps and bubbly beats. It’s the most energetic project MIKE’s ever made, an unexpected but welcome vibe change.MIKE and Tony Seltzer have worked together before, but not like this. Seltzer produced two songs on MIKE’s 2017 breakout, May God Bless Your Hustle. His work on that album was deeply chill: “STANDOUT” married mechanical drums to atmospheric pads, a nod to the bygone cloud rap sound, and “Paul” was glistening chimes and screwed-down boom bap, barely recognizable as a Tony Seltzer beat. The two stayed in touch over the years and reconnected while MIKE assembled Burning Desire. He’d wrap up a song for Desire at his apartment, then head to Seltzer’s studio to clear his head. Seltzer would play whatever beats he’d made that week and MIKE would stop him when he heard something that stuck. The two made “R&B” more as a fun exercise than anything else, but the work felt so effortless they decided to keep going.On Pinball, Seltzer’s in top form, providing MIKE with cartoonish trap beats, candy-colored drill, and quiet storm snap music. His drums bounce around themselves with a raised-eyebrows energy, as if they’re friends who didn’t expect to see each other show up at the same party. They seem to scatter as they hit, leaving wide-open spaces for rappers and samples alike to ooze into. The barely-there percussion on “2k24 Tour” gives the orchestral loop ample breathing room, the occasional 808 downbeats providing a hypnotic propulsive feel. On “Lethal Weapon,” Seltzer’s sporadic hi-hats and rimshots turn chintzy MIDI instruments into a pastel swirl of Delta 8 psychedelia, and the ’80s synth pads of “Skurrr” drape over deep bass like satin sheets on a marble statue. The wild jump between sounds isn’t ever jarring, though. The longer you listen, the more lush and inviting it becomes.",Rap,8.0
394,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit the 1969 album that provided a pioneering experimental composer with his own scales and instruments to make music that elevated stories from the fringes of American life to mythological status. The world of Harry Partch was a difficult one. Over the first three-quarters of the 20th century, he moved through it mostly sick and broke, with little sustained attention and even less money paid to his extraordinary world-building. Out of step with the various artistic movements his work would prefigure or refuse, the pioneering experimental composer was mostly viewed as too arcane, too complicated…too much. In truth, he was one of American music’s great inventors: of entirely new scales; of massive, sculptural instruments whose material and form looked back to antiquity and toward nuclear war; of a way of singing he felt more accurately replicated the rise and fall of everyday American speech.And of ways to thwart himself: He drank excessively, and frustrated friends and patrons alike with his combination of ambition and self-defeat. He died in 1974, in unrequited love with a young man who was working on a documentary about him that was supposed to change it all. (That shuddering sound you just heard was a thousand gay men in ecstatic melancholy at the prospect of such a fate.) Partch left a body of work that is extremely difficult to perform or otherwise reproduce, because it requires the use of his custom-made instruments and the highly specialized knowledge of how to play them. For a long time, the world barely seemed to notice.Five years before Partch’s death, in the July 12, 1969, issue of Rolling Stone, Columbia Records ran an ad for a compilation called The World of Harry Partch. The album’s cover showed him silver-haired and tucked into a dapper plaid shirt, surrounded by his instruments and staring down the viewer. “That’s why this album will shock you,” the ad copy proclaimed in bold letters. It seemed as much a dare as a promise, a bet that the same rock-oriented audiences getting their minds blown that year by the bohemian Moondog’s self-titled album and Terry Riley’s synth-bliss A Rainbow in Curved Air just might dig this avant-garde composer as well. The World was a strange choice for appealing to Rolling Stone’s rock-oriented audience, no matter how thoroughly the exploding psychedelic movement had primed them for musical exploration.There is a shivery, side-long interpretation of the myth of Daphne and Apollo, set to marimba arpeggios in an ever-changing rhythmic meter. On the flip, “Barstow - Eight Hitchhiker Inscriptions From A Highway Railing At Barstow, California” roams for 10 minutes, its instruments sounding like massive motorized Slinkys gunning their engines and looking for adventure, while men sort of yodel and scat and intone personals messages that Partch found scrawled on a roadside in his years of transient life.",Experimental,9.0
395,"The virtuoso saxophonist’s 1969 album with Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, and Jack DeJohnette is an essential document of a transitional moment in which everything in jazz seemed up for grabs. Jazz, like the world it reflected, was in flux in 1969. That year, Miles Davis released In a Silent Way, an album whose low-key atmosphere belied its status as a herald of major upheaval, leading the music into a decade of electric instruments, studio-driven experiments, and rhythms that drew as much from funk and R&B as swing. Yet plenty of people were still playing changes in the old-fashioned way: A musician could devote their entire life to mastering the art, and just because Miles was suddenly doing tape manipulation and listening to Sly and the Family Stone didn’t mean everyone else was following suit. And free jazz, a decade or so old at that point, was still a radical force, its elaborations and deconstructions of melody providing alternate routes forward from tradition, ones that didn’t necessarily require plugging in at all.Looking back, it’s tempting to see these various styles—fusion, straight-ahead, avant-garde—as utterly distinct and walled off, and it’s true that certain players could be dogmatic in their adherence to one idiom and rejection of the others. The case of tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson gives good reason to consider them more holistically. An old-school virtuoso who taught himself to play by transcribing and memorizing solos by bebop titans like Charlie Parker and Lester Young, he also brushed the edges of free jazz as a sideman with Andrew Hill, and encouraged his own supporting players to experiment with electronics even on records that steered clear of full-on fusion. His 1969 album Power to the People, available on vinyl for the first time in decades via a superb new reissue from Craft Recordings and Jazz Dispensary, is an essential document of this transitional moment, due in part to its creator’s disregard for rigid stylistic affiliation. If you want to hear, in a single album, how jazz—all of it—sounded just before the turn of the ’70s, you could do worse than this one.Henderson surrounded himself with a few of the world’s best players for Power to the People. Two, keyboardist Herbie Hancock and bassist Ron Carter, were veterans of Davis’ band, and one, drummer Jack DeJohnette, was just joining up with Miles at around the same time; Henderson also recruited up-and-coming trumpeter Mike Lawrence on two of the seven tracks. Across the album, Hancock switches between acoustic piano and Fender Rhodes, and Carter between upright and electric bass, choices that mirror the album’s fluid stylistic approach. Carter’s choice of bass, in particular, is a rough indicator of where a given track will fall on the spectrum. On upright, his primary instrument, he tends toward traditional walking lines, outlining the chords with a steady pulse that the rest of the players are free to improvise around. On electric, he dances more freely around the outskirts of the pocket, jabbing in and out in search of new rhythmic possibilities, nudging the music away from the jazz’s well-worn solo-and-accompaniment format and toward more open-ended group improvisation.",Jazz,9.1
396,"Kieren Hebden has been letting loose on stage, but he keeps it restrained on his smartly sequenced album that deftly incorporates virtually every style of music that he’s made over the years. Some performers start playing it safe when the stages get bigger. Not Kieran Hebden—better known as Four Tet—the heady, tasteful, crate-digging producer who has taken his new arena-sized crowds as an opportunity to confound, delight, and troll. Behind the decks, there’s no move that’s taboo, no track that’s off-limits. A decade ago, that meant raising eyebrows by going back-to-back in the booth with Skrillex, Now that he and Sonny Moore have become an Odd Throuple with Fred again.., the BFFs’ B2B2Bs are Hebden’s opportunity to further subvert whatever you might have thought Four Tet is supposed to sound like. At Madison Square Garden, he dropped a mischievous minimal-house edit of Taylor Swift’s “Love Story” that he’d cobbled together for his daughter. At Coachella, he used the intro to “Smells Like Teen Spirit” as the setup to an absurdist punchline: Hol!’s “Country Riddim,” a dubstep anthem featuring a cartoonishly garish drop. (Hebden loves that song: At the trio’s surprise Times Square gig in February 2023, he unleashed the tune again—and then spun it back to the top of the drop, just to savor its ridiculousness.)But however unpredictable Hebden might be on stage, on record he’s as reliable as they come. Three is his 12th solo album, give or take—the proliferation of live recordings, early-works anthologies, shadowy side projects, and experimental longform excursions complicates the count—and it embodies everything that has come to define Four Tet over the years. There are shuffling UK garage rhythms and moonlit pools of ambient, heavy-lidded head-nodders and floor-filling rave-ups, hand-carved breakbeats and harps, harps, and more harps.A few years back, I found Four Tet’s consistency on his albums frustrating; I longed for him to switch things up, throw the occasional wrench in the works. I wondered, with 2020’s Sixteen Oceans, if he was getting boxed in by his formula. But on Three, the familiarity is welcome. The record is less experimental than 2020’s Parallel, which collected the 2-stepping club tracks and atmospheric experiments of his alias ⣎⡇ꉺლ༽இ•̛)ྀ◞ ༎ຶ ༽ৣৢ؞ৢ؞ؖ ꉺლ. But the trim, eight-track album is smartly sequenced and nicely varied, taking in virtually every style of music that Hebden’s made over the years—house, downbeat, hip-hop, and more, all given the customary Four Tet slant. Most importantly, he sounds energized, as though all that mischief-making behind the decks had taught him new twists in old tricks.",Electronic,7.8
397,"The Chicago footwork producer trades the genre’s emphasis on sampling for ultra-vivid sound design fleshed out with futuristic textures and classic synths. Chicago footwork producer Heavee first acquired a taste for dance music through cartoons and video games. In an interview, he cited the breakbeat-laden scores from The Powerpuff Girls and Jet Set Radio Future as his introduction to electronic music. Some of his first tracks he produced on a Playstation 2, using Funkmaster Flex’s Digital Hitz Factory. On his 2018 debut album with the Teklife collective, Heavee’s lush, nostalgic synth arrangements set his style apart from the more minimalistic sound of his peers, and 2022’s Audio Assault, on Hyperdub, nodded even more clearly to the sounds of his youth, using eerie melodies and 16-bit samples to emulate the atmosphere of boss battles.Heavee’s first full-length for Hyperdub, Unleash, is largely a study in sound design, exploring strange metallic textures, new-age kitsch, and vintage club chord progressions. “Unlock!” opens with gnarly bass tones that sound like the growls of a high-level beast in a role-playing game, accompanied only by droning pulses of static. It’s a profoundly unsettling intro (especially for a track slotted so early into a dance record), but Heavee’s patience pays off when the elements finally coalesce into a beat. The result strikes a balance between Hausu Mountain’s proggy sound collage and SOPHIE’s most purely percussive experiments; it’s a wasps’ nest of intersecting hums, harried fluttering, and insectoid chirps. “Whiplash” is a similarly industrial reconstruction of footwork: Around woozy, pitched-down commands to “act a fool with it,” Heavee hammers away as though he were erecting scaffolding in the backdrop. It feels like dancing as the club is still being built around you.Elsewhere, Heavee offsets those pared-down cuts with baroque orchestration. Opener “StarSeeker” is as pretty as footwork gets, with sparkling synths reminiscent of ’90s IDM; “Smoke Break” enlists multi-instrumentalist Takayuka Nakamura to play live trumpet over dreamy jazz keyboards. A couple of tracks eschew drums entirely, focusing instead on Heavee’s fondness for the sounds of classic synths. With more traditional footwork cuts like “CanUFeelIt” and the Goodie Mob-referencing “WorkMe’’ filling in the space between the producer’s more out-there ideas, Unleash acts as a survey of both the genre’s history and the artist’s own.Unleash connects the chrome-plated optimism of Y2K pop culture to its influence on both a young Heavee and the cybernetic grit of early footwork, while charting a path forward that acknowledges contemporary avant-garde club sounds. The album can be chaotic, jumping from one disparate idea to the next, but each element draws you closer to understanding Heavee better. Where many footwork records work with a relatively contained set of samples and timbres, focusing most of their attention on rhythm, Heavee is an ambitious world-builder: Each track sounds like it’s been sourced from a different planet, but their intersecting orbits sketch a picture of the artist’s unmistakable vision.",Electronic,7.5
398,"The country star’s sixth album is an endlessly pretty back-to-basics record focused on growing and bettering oneself. It’s a balm, even if her sharp songwriting has dulled a bit. You only have to listen to the last few weeks in pop music to understand that, yes, Saturn has very much returned. There are its icy rings barging into Ariana Grande’s eternal sunshine in “Saturn Returns Interlude,” a brief explainer about the astrological notion that after the 29 years or so it takes for Saturn to orbit the sun, major life transitions may ensue. SZA begged its ammonia-yellow light to shine on her in Lana teaser “Saturn.” And now here is Kacey Musgraves, welcoming back the gassy giant to remind her that some people are givers and some are takers and she’s well shot of the latter on “Deeper Well,” the title track of her sixth studio album.The pro forma language of astrology, tarot, and therapy is all over the charts lately. These are great boons to the famous: ways for them to venture relatability without disclosure, and to make the listener feel centered in the music, too. While you, a civilian, may never know what it’s like to feel dogged by deuxmoi, I’m a Leo and so are you! On the endlessly pretty Deeper Well, Musgraves encounters energy vampires, boundaries, moon bathing, the mycelium network, the power of jade stone, and breaking patterns that no longer serve her; the song “Dinner With Friends” is a torn-out gratitude journal page. The wistful folksy vibe is very much “pottering around your local wellness shop picking up crystals and sniffing the hand-rolled palo santo incense.” Sageing my cynicism momentarily, these things seem to have genuinely helped Musgraves as a person, and all power to her. But as songwriting concerns, they wash out the erstwhile country radical’s incisiveness, her winks, her delightfully subverted cliches, and turn a beloved outsider into a solipsist. Once she’s sweetly bid “goodbye to the people that I feel are real good at wasting my time” on the second song, the world outside is all but gone.Deeper Well is Musgraves’ back-to-basics record after 2021’s conflicted star-crossed. Written after her divorce from fellow country singer Ruston Kelly, the lyrics were fragile and vulnerable but came in sleek pop packaging with Lemonade-sized ambitions. It didn’t connect in the same way as her 2018 psychedelic opus Golden Hour. You might imagine her next step to be another corrective, whether commercial or creative, but Deeper Well beats a further retreat. “I don’t care for money or fame,” Musgraves sings on an album that exudes disregard in its rainy-day strums and glazed vocal refrains. There are teases of more compelling directions not taken: Those lyrics are from highlight “Heaven Is,” which, like “Jade Green,” has the mournful formality of traditional British folk in its spindles. The influence of Nick Drake and Linda Thompson collides with Musgraves’ Texan roots on the yearning opener “Cardinal,” which unavoidably evokes “California Dreamin’”—but also the impeccable The Trials of Van Occupanther by her fellow Lone Star druids Midlake. It makes the idea of Musgraves striking out on a folk-rock quest over the existential plains sound extremely appealing.",Folk,6.8
399,"Fueled by controlled fury and unfathomable sorrow, Camae Ayewa’s latest album of Afrofuturist collage traces the traumatic legacy of European colonialism. Across eight albums, Moor Mother—aka Camae Ayewa—has bore witness to history’s sins, threading connections between past, present, and future in a sensory overload fusing industrial noise, “witch rap,” and free jazz. “Going to see Emmett Till out his casket/Beaten to death with a hatchet/For whistlin’ at white girls,” she rapped on 2016’s Fetish Bones. On 2020’s Circuit City, she traced the racial disparities fueling the housing crisis. And on 2022’s Jazz Codes, she documented the erasure of Black genres in an attempt to rescue them from institutional amnesia.On The Great Bailout, Moor Mother interrogates the knotty relationship between Europe and Africa, confronting the enduring legacy of colonialism. Journeying back to the 19th century, she shines a spotlight on Britain’s Slavery Abolition Act of 1833—a perverse form of reparations that compensated former slave owners, to the tune of £20 million. The enslaved people in the British Caribbean received nothing; rather, they were subjected to a four-year transition period, during which they were forced to work without pay. The Guardian called it “the largest bailout in British history until the bailout of the banks in 2009”. Funded by British taxpayers across generations, the debt was only repaid in 2015.By grounding The Great Bailout in the bedrock of British colonialism, Ayewa unearths an overlooked narrative of slavery, one often eclipsed by tales of American enslavement. Simultaneously, she connects the dispersed voices of the African diaspora by mapping out the far-reaching echoes of European imperialism, and joining forces with peers like British Iraqi soprano Alya Al-Sultani. Lines like “Who’s without citizenship?” and “Who’s still burning?” offer reminders of history’s grip on today’s crises, whether in Palestine, Sudan, or along the the Mexican-American border.Unfathomable sorrow and controlled fury give the album its shape. On the opening “GUILTY,” Lonnie Holley sings over Raia Was’ siren calls, “We watched the slave ships being unloaded,” as harpist Mary Lattimore plucks out gossamer melodies; Moor Mother’s voice rises in the mix, whispering “Guilty, guilty,” before turning to an accusation: “Paying the crimes off/Did you pay off the trauma?” Built from sputtering drum machines, jazz horns, and queasy electronic tones, The Great Bailout is a disorienting hall of mirrors with no exit in sight. Every uneven loop and distorted blast amplifies the feeling of being trapped in a Dutch angle. Much like Moor Mother’s Analog Fluids of Sonic Black Holes, The Great Bailout revels in discomfort. “ALL THE MONEY” suggests an illbient take on a Jordan Peele thriller, and the glitch-corrupted “LIVERPOOL WINS,” co-produced with Wolf Eyes’ Aaron Dilloway, feels like waking into a nightmare.",Experimental,7.8
400,"On their second album, the UK post-punks embrace a more playful, dynamic sound, while acerbic frontman James Smith trades caricature for self-reflection. A cast of lager-swilling characters populates UK post-punk revivalists Yard Act’s songs. On their Mercury-nominated 2022 debut album, The Overload, frontman James Smith took on the perspective of a small-time estate agent who had given up on his dreams of being an international footballer, a greedy landlord named Graeme, and even Yard Act’s own critics, while casting Harry Potter actor David Thewlis to replace him in the “100% Endurance” video. But on the band’s second album, Where’s My Utopia?, Smith turns the focus of his spoken-word lyrics on himself.His lens has been shifting for a while: In the interim between albums, the band released “The Trench Coat Museum,” an eight-minute caper in which Smith mused on the history of the military-inspired outerwear—a post-punk trope he had in fact recently given up, having come to see something cartoonish in the image it projected. “That’s the thing about pop culture,” he said: “Oversized characters get more attention. I was ready to step away from that because I didn’t want to be trapped by it.” Although Where’s My Utopia? ostensibly began as a concept album about one of U2’s roadies, Smith eventually abandoned that framework—as well as the arch satire of the first album—in favor of vulnerability and candor.Smith’s self-reflection is bolstered by a more confident, free-roaming sound. Recruiting another oversized cartoon character in the form of Gorillaz’s Remi Kabaka Jr., who handles production, the record fizzes and grooves with fresh energy, borrowing strokes from hip-hop, Afrobeat, and funk. Where Yard Act were previously best known for snarling post-punk minimalism, here they lean into a bass-driven strut on “Dream Job,” are buoyed by waves of bubbling synths and children’s voices on “Grifter’s Grief,” and bask in the sunset glow of powerful backing singers on the rapturous “A Vineyard for the North.” At every turn, they’re more ambitiously lavish, sounding less like their fellow British post-post-punks than genre-spanning contortionists like Beck, LCD Soundsystem, and Gorillaz. But Smith’s lyrics retain their gritty realism in casually evocative storytelling that lands somewhere between Jarvis Cocker, Mike Skinner, and your mate in the pub. Smith’s vivid observations often seem designed to undercut the record’s luxurious production: In one vignette, over a beachy flourish of guitar, he relays dropping a saliva-coated candy on the floor as a child, and the disappointment of finding it inedible, covered in old crumbs and dead skin.Even when they take themselves more seriously, Yard Act are never self-serious. Despite the fact that it primarily focuses on the pitfalls of living your “dream job”—hardly new territory for a breakout band’s second album, whether self-aware or not—Where’s My Utopia? manages enough genuine pop finesse and laugh-out-loud punchlines to keep the cliché from grating. On the boisterous “We Make Hits,” Smith traces the band’s origin story, poking fun at their willingness to sell out with an anthemic, hand-clapping chorus that joyfully appropriates the maximalism of indie sleaze. (And if it isn’t an actual hit, Smith hedges, “We were being ironic.”) The more downbeat, grunge-y “Petroleum” addresses an infamous 2023 incident in which Smith turned on his unreceptive crowd during a show at the UK seaside town of Bognor Regis. It may not be the most sympathetic premise—successful rock frontman belatedly feels bad for slagging off his audience—but the song’s relentless groove and layers of Auto-Tuned vocals tell a bodily tale of the anxiety of maintaining a public image.Where Smith is most compelling, though, is where he turns his attention to knottier subjects that resist simple resolution. On “Down by the Stream” he looks scathingly at his own history as a childhood bully over a clattering hip-hop beat. Halfway through, the song breaks open into a cavernous, beatless reflection on the cycle of abuse, bristling with confusion, anger, and regret. The record’s apex is “Blackpool Illuminations,” Smith’s spoken-word tale of a childhood injury sustained at the northern English seaside town’s annual seafront light show. At over seven minutes long, winding through jazz flute, taut funk bass, and cinematic strings, Smith’s existential magnum opus takes a whistlestop journey from his own childhood to his new role as a parent to his son.“Are you making this up?” asks an incredulous therapist, also played by Smith, toward the end of the song. “Er, some of it, yeah, why?” he responds. Smith may have abandoned his trench-coat persona in favor of a more honest self-portrait, but the line between the authentic self and the larger-than-life character remains provocatively fuzzy.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

401,"Fueled by off-the-cuff bars, absurdist maximalism, and elastic flows, the artist’s new mixtape is a welcome blast of rowdy Atlanta rap. Thanks to Whole Lotta Red’s generational impact, nostalgia for the outliers in Gucci Mane and Young Thug’s catalogs, and the enduring influence of Chief Keef, a new wave of rowdy and absurd Atlanta underground rap has emerged. There are Lazer Dim 700’s blown-out, stream-of-consciousness spectacles, which are dingy in the best way; 2Sdxrt3all’s screamed ad-libs, which sound like the devil on his shoulder come to life; Bear1boss’ overloaded AutoTune melodies; and L5’s psychological interpretation of drill, to name a few. Not all of it is that interesting—for instance, Baby Kia’s new age horrorcore is tryhard edgy—but what all the music has in common is that there is no restraint in sight. The same goes for Queen of the Land, a raw new mixtape by Glorygirl2950.There are a few facts to know about Glorygirl2950. For one, she really likes Keef—her name is a callback to his imprint Glory Boyz Entertainment. She is 5 foot 5 (she points this out a lot), hates malls (fair), and doesn’t use parking lots (her car is too fast to abide by any speed limits, of course). This isn’t the most personal music; being as wild and cool as possible is the only clear goal. That would be more vapid than it is—somewhat like Ken Carson’s X, which basically had the same mission—if Queen of the Land wasn’t actually wild and cool. This mixtape is full of so much shrill-voiced wailing, gunshot sound effects, unexpected, acrobatic flows, and seemingly improvised vocal warbles and gibberish that it can be overwhelming. In a way, it recalls the foundational yet flawed Thug tape I Came From Nothing 3, where he engineered a style so wacko that you weren’t even sure how seriously to take it.However, you should take Queen of the Land seriously. Like ICFN3, this is fun yet messy ATL rap. Over a collection of beats that pull from plugg and vintage trap music, Glorygirl constantly stretches melodies to their breaking point and veers off course just because she can. She delivers off-the-cuff bars like “A bitch get popped in her BBL butt” on “Slang for Me,” her flow so slurred it feels as if she’d downed a six-pack before hitting the booth. The background ad-libs sound like the squeaks of a mouse stuck on a trap, but then her delivery accelerates out of nowhere. It’s both extremely erratic and extremely replayable. So is “WNBA,” in which she’s popping and fluttering her lips for the first 25 seconds; fast forward a little and suddenly she’s onto an Adam and Eve diatribe that would make RXK Nephew proud. She makes choices randomly and recklessly, like on “2950,” the ragiest of the tracks, where it sounds like she’s rapping with a wad of gum in her mouth. Or take “Molly X,” where, in a cracked screech, she brags about all the cows she owns. Obviously bullshit, but good bullshit.Queen of the Land’s pitfalls and strengths are mostly a result of the same issue: There is no toning Glorygirl down. Sometimes that makes for songs that are straight-up abrasive and annoying. Think of the ear-splitting shoutfest “Glory Freestyle,” or consider “Fireball,” where she can hardly get through a line without mimicking the sound of a chirping bird. It gets unbearable fast. A label might have given her the advice to chill out a bit, though that’s the kind of note that may have sanded down the thrills, too. What’s made Atlanta a longtime creative hub for independent, underground rappers is that the city’s environment often pushes artists to go big with their most rash ideas, even if they wind up faceplanting half of the time. One thing’s for sure: Queen of the Land couldn’t have come from anywhere else.",Rap,7.4
402,"The Brazilian pianist brings his dazzling polyrhythms—plus guests like Jeff Parker and Brandee Younger—to an album that fuses jazz, avant-garde composition, and indigenous Amazonian influences. Like the tropicalistas of the 1960s, Amaro Freitas believes in the sophistication of traditional Brazilian music. Hailing from the northeastern city of Recife—a regional neighbor of Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso’s Salvador—he combines the rural sounds of his native region with the cosmopolitan flash of Río de Janeiro. Since making his debut in 2016 with Sangue Negro, Freitas has incorporated the rhythms of rumba and baião with hard bop attitude and an elegant formalism closer to Bach than Bahia. Y’Y, his latest, was inspired in part by a trip to Manaus, a city of two million deep in the Amazon. The only real musical connection the album has to Freitas’ previous work is his presence on the keys. Gone is the urbane small-ensemble jazz of 2018’s Rasif and 2021’s more adventurous Sankofa, replaced with humid, spacious music that moves from tranquility to cacophony with remarkable ease.Freitas’ polyrhythmic playing—simultaneously unpsooling different cadences in each hand—is at once lacy and delicate, thumping and propulsive; “it’s as though my left hand is Africa and my right hand is Europe,” he recently told The New York Times. On Y’Y, he finds new ways to apply that philosophy to his arrangements. On “Uira (Encantada da Água) - Vida e cura,” he plays a prepared piano whose muted strings transform the notes into stipples of percussion, more like a tabla than a conventional keyboard instrument, while the feathery filigree of a second, untreated piano seems to float across the top. A bassline reminiscent of Mulatu Astatke’s Ethio-jazz paces around an anxious plucked figure in “Dança dos Martelos,” and as Freitas begins to merge the two patterns, he bangs on the lower octaves, which rattle with prepared shells. Throughout, he applies little trills and plays riffs that feel palindromic, phasing with the left hand while the right hand is still sprinkling pixie dust. Tidiness and precision have always been some of his greatest strengths, and it’s thrilling to hear him complicate his own tendency toward order.While these experiments move Y’Y farther from jazz and closer to the spirit of both indigenous Amazonian music and the avant-garde classical realm, Freitas engages in lively conversations with a series of guests in the album’s second half, bringing to mind the open world of McCoy Tyner’s Extensions. He simmers Jeff Parker’s stately guitar into a red-eyed, late-night groove in “Mar de Cirandeiras,” while in “Gloriosa,” he brings Brandee Younger’s harp glissandos down to earth with a single note that pings over and over.",Jazz,8.0
403,"Chad Ubovich returns from the brink with a dark, ambitious psych-rock record. The fuzz-drone riffs are big enough to hit the rafters and there’s plenty of niche touches for the heads. Psychedelic rock has long been a means to distort and escape reality and, as such, it has a reputation for being a passive, emotionally detached artform, born from the state of being too fucked up to feel. But few contemporary artists seize upon the genre’s disassociative powers with such intensity and urgency as Meatbodies’ Chad Ubovich. Where his band first appeared 10 years ago as a high-octane punk-fueled satellite in the greater Ty Segall Universe, Meatbodies’ transportive ambitions have, perhaps not coincidentally, expanded dramatically as Ubovich has grappled with the many hard-knock realities he’s sought to escape.After spending most of his 20s on the road with Meatbodies and various other affiliated acts (including Mikal Cronin’s live band and proto-metal power trio Fuzz with Segall and Charlie Moothart), Ubovich reached his physical and mental breaking point after the release of 2017’s Alice and hit the pause button—only to replace the all-consuming mania of tour life with the all-consuming mania of drug use. Upon getting sober, he began working on Flora Ocean Tiger Bloom, in 2019, but had to abort mission partway through once COVID lockdowns took effect in early 2020. (While waiting out the pandemic at home, Ubovich and drummer Dylan Fujioka dusted off some scrappy old demos and punched them up for 2021’s stopgap mini-LP, 333.) And once it was safe to properly resume work on Flora Ocean Tiger Bloom, Ubovich lost his home and nearly his life: the house he had been living in for eight years was condemned, but not before its contaminated environs spurred a debilitating case of pneumonia that left Ubovich hospitalized for a month, to the point where his recovery involved relearning how to walk and play his instruments. So if anyone’s earned the right to check out from reality and indulge in the transcendental properties of psychedelic rock, it’s this dude.But despite all the chaos and upheaval Ubovich has endured, Flora Ocean Tiger Bloom is a testament to his clarity of vision. And for Ubovich, that means fine-tuning his iconoclastic inspirations to suit his own feel-good needs: Flora Ocean Tiger Bloom regularly consults the Spacemen 3 playbook for both its fuzz-drone riffs and ambient orchestrations—there’s even an instrumental interlude unsubtly titled “(Return of) Ecstasy”—but applies them to more classically styled ’60s psych-pop tunes; songs like “Billow” mirror the tambourine-rattled stoner sway of the Brian Jonestown Massacre, but rock much harder. And while Ubovich shares a mischievous melodic sensibility with his old pal Segall, Meatbodies project more of an anthemic bravado that transforms their niche record-collector concerns into mass-appealing, festival-ready rock music: “The Assignment” imagines how Oasis’ Be Here Now might’ve turned out if the Gallaghers spent more time doing acid than coke, while “Hole” is part DIY “Cherub Rock” grungegaze groover, part Laser Floyd synth spectacle.",Rock,7.6
404,"The pop star returns with a restrained, slightly scattered, but emotionally generous album that cycles through the collapse of one relationship and into the hopeful beginning of another. As Ariana Grande rounded out the final year of her charmed and tumultuous 20s, it would have been more than enough for her to simply reflect on the previous decade. Taken together, the whole supercut of her meteoric rise, milestone achievements, high-profile relationships, confrontations with angels and demons, and widely heralded moments of grace under fire, would have provided Grande with more than enough material for a capstone album. But as her Saturn returned, and the much-referenced astrological event came to pass, Grande was forced to face down some of her most personally challenging news cycles to date. Since 2020’s Positions, Grande married discreetly and divorced publicly, began production on the movie adaptation of the musical Wicked, and sparked a new romance (and almost immediate controversy) with her co-star, Ethan Slater, Broadway’s very own Spongebob Squarepants.Grande’s career has been presented to us as a chain of successive breakthroughs, whether making a full-throated bid for pop glory (My Everything), persevering through almost unthinkable degrees of heartbreak (Sweetener), or fully embracing her adult sensuality (Positions). Like Taylor Swift, the singer has been able to maintain a mass following by time-stamping each era with different boyfriends, makeovers, and most crucially: lending the decisive final word to all the back-biting and petty gossip. On eternal sunshine, Grande takes a widely publicized moment of personal upheaval and chisels it into the a-ha! moment of her discography. Loosely billed as a “concept record” about her divorce and the personal revelations her Saturn return inspired, sunshine is a slightly scattered, but emotionally generous collection of music that cycles compassionately through the collapse of one relationship and into the hopeful beginning of another.Drawing inspiration from the 2004 Michel Gondry film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind—a surreal romantic comedy in which people can elect to have unwanted memories erased as a form of therapy—Grande concerns herself with the residual feelings and tortured thoughts that linger long after a breakup. Over an understated guitar strum and faux-romantic strings on “intro (end of the world)”, she introduces the record’s central theme by immediately ripping into a series of blunt, rapid-fire questions: “How can I tell if I’m in the right relationship?/Aren’t you really supposed to know that shit?/Feel it in your bones and own that shit?” She announces her breakup moments later with the Studio 54 strut of “bye,” but the song’s triumphant kiss-off almost immediately doubles back on itself with dislodged memories, delayed anguish, and brutal recriminations on the following tracks.",Pop,7.2
405,"The Belo Horizonte-based producer has developed an eerie, minimalist take on Brazilian funk that’s a world away from the heavier strains associated with Río de Janeiro or São Paulo. Once associated mainly with Río de Janeiro, Brazilian funk has exploded stylistically in recent years; countless tributaries have branched out across the country’s vast landscape. DJ Anderson do Paraíso hails from Belo Horizonte, Brazil’s third largest metropolitan area. While Belo Horizonte’s funk scene is as raucous and lyrically scandalous as those in the larger cities, it has become defined by an almost elegant minimalism, sparser and more refined than the heavy distortion of Paulista bruxaria or Río’s more hip-hop-oriented sound. Back in 2017, when the more experimentally minded BH scene was still getting started, Brazilian critic GG Albuquerques described its sound as resembling “ambient space funk.”While many of these tracks have been previously available as loosies, Kampala, Uganda-based Nyege Nyege Tapes has collected DJ Anderson’s work into a single package. Queridão is part of a growing wave of compilations that translate the lawless edges of Brazilian funk into an album format that’s more easily accessible to curious listeners far removed from the local scene. Anderson’s skeletal tracks are more conducive to armchair listening than a great deal of funk, which typically compels the body to move. His slightly more downtempo style reduces the music to its barest necessities, hollowed out into a spacious cavern of metallic clanks and unsettling moans.Anderson regularly incorporates classical instrumentation, like the razor-sharp cello on opener “Sadomasoquista” or the muted horns on “Joga Leite.” “Se Faz de Samantha” opens with strings that almost sound like they’re about to break into “Amazing Grace” before the sample cuts off and loops back. On “Paty Trem Barbie,” which incorporates a plunky bassline and the seductions of vocalist MC Magrella, he triggers the infamous squeaking sound effect familiar to fans of Jersey and Baltimore club—commonly misidentified as a mattress spring, but actually the sound of a chair in the studio where Lil Jon was working on Trillville’s “Some Cut.” Typically, though, when he deploys contemporary hip-hop tropes, like the drill wubs and trappy hi-hats on “Pincelada de Angolano,” they sound more off-kilter than familiar, drums scattering into chaos.The voices are mixed more cleanly than many of the bass-boosted funk transmissions that go viral stateside, but the repetition—like the chant-like delivery of MC PR and MC Bim on “Todas Elas ao Mesmo Tempo”—is hypnotic, and so are Anderson’s robotic loops. On “Quarenta Cheio de Odio,” a haunted vocal sample and choral chants echo back and forth over a trance-like instrumental that recalls new age-tinged rave from the 1990s. But instead of building to a cathartic drop or ecstatic chorus, Anderson keeps us in a state of perpetual motion.",Electronic,7.8
406,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit SWV’s 1992 prodigious debut, a stylish album that added a singular realness to the sound of R&B. It’s possible that the only person in the world who didn’t like SWV’s “Weak” was the woman who sang lead on it, Cheryl “Coko” Gamble. She didn’t understand it—in fact, she “hated” the song when its writer-producer Brian Alexander Morgan presented it to her during their first recording session together. So strong was her reaction that she hid in a bathroom and had to be coerced out of it to record the track.Good thing she got over it. The ’90s slow jam against which all ‘90s slow jams would be judged went on to peak at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in July 1993, dislodging Janet Jackson’s megahit “That’s the Way Love Goes” from its eight-week run at the summit. By that point, R&B’s commercial prowess was apparent—Boyz II Men spent 13 weeks at the top spot the previous year with “End of the Road,” written and produced by the trinity of Babyface, L.A. Reid, and Daryl Simmons. “Weak” clearly didn’t leap out to its singer as the era-defining ballad it would become, but then, nor did SWV immediately scan as the pop stars they would turn into months after the release of their 1992 debut, It’s About Time.A certain scrappiness was key to their appeal. They were three self-described around-the-way girls from New York who often handled their own wardrobe. They blended classic girl-group harmonies and church singing (Coko was an alum of “hip-hop pastor” and gospel great Hezekiah Walker’s choir). They embodied the ’90s ideal of not trying too hard—there was no indication of crazy, and they were intermittently sexy, but they were full-time cool. When asked in an interview what their secret was, Leanne “Lelee” Lyons shot back, “There’s no secret. We’re real.” Their debut was home to simple, direct bangers that said what they meant and meant what they said. The album exudes a kind of bluntness you’d expect from New Yorkers.It was Lelee’s idea to start the group with Coko, a friend she knew from her hometown of the Bronx. Before moving there in her teens, Coko lived in Brooklyn, where she got to know Tamara “Taj” Johnson-George (née Johnson). The group that would become SWV went through some format and lineup shake-ups before tapping Taj to audition. They also had a few names before settling on SWV: One of them, TLC (for Taj, Lelee, and Coko), was dropped upon the emergence of another girl group that would become a juggernaut in their own right. Their manager Maureen Singleton came up with SWV—Sisters With Voices—because their harmonic blend was so tight they sounded like actual sisters; Coko initially thought the name was ugly.",Pop,8.6
407,"Following his 2022 collaboration with Charlotte Adigéry, the Belgian-born producer examines his Hong Kong heritage on an album of clean-lined synth pop and invigorating club tracks. On 2022’s Topical Dancer, producer Bolis Pupul and frequent collaborator Charlotte Adigéry examined xenophobia and misogyny by transmuting them into discursive electro pop with a cheeky sense of humor. On his debut solo album, the Belgian-born producer takes a more personal turn. Pupul lost his mother, Yu Wei Wun, suddenly in 2008, a death that shaped his life from that day on. Yet it’s one he says he couldn’t grasp fully until nearly a decade later, when he first traveled to his mother’s native Hong Kong. There, he discovered a connection to his roots that diasporic people often feel upon visiting a familial homeland, forming an elemental bond even without an ancestor to guide him. The life-changing experience informs Letter to Yu, a shapeshifting ode to both his mother and Hong Kong that darts between sawtoothed club songs and more languid comedowns. Pupul’s music is at once contemplative and exuberant, moving with a rhythm similar to navigating the teeming crowds of a new city.While Pupul was making trips to Hong Kong, visiting landmarks like the bustling Ma Tau Wai Road or traversing the city subway, he recorded every day, even if just capturing snippets of found sound. Those recordings give Letter to Yu a distinct sense of place, like the din of a train platform that courses through the background of “Completely Half.” Over a tugging synth melody, Pupul grapples with the language barrier that deepens the split in his identity: “People talk to me like I’m a local/A sense of shame is my part,” he sings in a halting melody; “I wish I spoke what they speak/So I could blend in easily.” Many of Letter to Yu’s best songs dip into that pondering register—like the brooding, hypnotic title track, on which Pupul pitch-shifts his voice down as he reads a letter to his mother. “This is where you were born 59 years ago/And I’m finally here,” he intones as chimes echo around him. “Why did it take me so long?”Pupul’s productions alternate between pensive moments and out-and-out floor-fillers. Letter to Yu’s most energized songs recall his limber production on Topical Dancer while ratcheting up the intensity: The martial stomp of “Doctor Says” builds to a jagged synth freakout, while the turbo-charged “Kowloon” folds droning keys into a sauntering drum beat for a madcap French rave-up. It’s a fresh and invigorating take on electro pop, twisting and buckling into different shapes with each surprising beat switch. Pupul puts his foot on the gas on the bracing standout “Spicy Crab,” where crinkled synths clamor for attention over a dizzying spiral of electro riffs; its kaleidoscopic climax is one of the album’s high points.",Electronic,8.0
408,"Pairing blown-out trap beats and industrial noise with deadpan stream-of-consciousness lyrics, Gordon’s second solo album revels in the broken and the mundane. Kim Gordon, like everyone, is addicted to her phone. Her vicious and brilliant second solo album, The Collective, shares its name with a painting she exhibited at New York’s 303 Gallery last year; 27 iPhone-sized holes had been punched out the canvas, each gap a cute little reminder of every synapse you’ve fried watching parkour clips or chasing the infinite scroll. The album itself is even less subtle: Powered by ear-splitting trap beats and churning industrial guitar, anchored by lyrics in which Gordon recites packing lists or mutters about driving in Los Angeles, The Collective is a maelstrom of mundane thoughts and funny asides and flashes of pure rage whipped into a heavy, unnerving fog. It sounds how TikTok brain feels.It’s a provocative but fitting new mode for Gordon, who, for over 40 years, has intermingled caustic experimental art with a mordant curiosity about mainstream culture. For every obtusely confrontational side project like Free Kitten, there is a Ciccone Youth, the Sonic Youth alter-ego dedicated to reinterpreting radio confections like “Into the Groove” and “Addicted to Love.” She holds down Body/Head, an elliptical guitar drone project with Bill Nace, yet also serenaded Rufus Humphrey and Lily van der Woodsen at their wedding on Gossip Girl. On The Collective, she lays her trademark breathy sprechgesang over what can only be described as Ken Carson-type beats, diving fully into the trap experiments she first tried on 2019’s No Home Record; sometimes, as on opening track “BYE BYE,” she genuinely sounds like a SoundCloud rapper, nonchalantly distending the names of luxury clothing brands: “Bella Freud, Y-S-L, Eck-haus-Lat-ta.”No Home Record, Gordon’s first solo album after making music in bands for 38 years, was thematically oblique, but on songs like “Earthquake” and “Murdered Out,” her stoic visage slipped, revealing lyrics that sounded like stinging, unapologetic rebukes to a persona non grata in Gordon’s life. The Collective, made once again with alt-pop producer Justin Raisen (Sky Ferreira, Charli XCX), puts aside the score-settling in favor of fractured, stream-of-consciousness lyrics that mostly eschew poetry or diarism. The unrelentingly noisy vibe is appealingly impulsive and lizard-brained, like you’re hearing someone remind themself to form thoughts: She mumbles about buying overpriced potatoes and leaving out money for the cleaner, stretches the phrase “bowling trophies” into the album’s closest approximation of a melody, and wails something that sounds like a religious prophecy on “The Believers.” While recording, Raisen encouraged Gordon to bring her “abstract poetry shit,” and the resulting album feels simultaneously dense and invigorating; on “I Don’t Miss My Mind,” asides about home furnishings brush up against a goblin-voiced call to “suck it up/fuck it up” and a hazy memory of “crying in the subway.” There’s no lyric sheet, and many songs feel like Rorschach tests asking whether you hear resilience or brokenness, sex or violence, mundanity or surrealism. Often, it’s hard to tell the difference.",Rock,8.5
409,"On his fourth solo album, Jack Antonoff and his band keep writing their own version of the rock’n’roll myth. It’s clever, empathetic, and still a bit clunky. Put the new Bleachers record on for a friend and they might be floored: Do the National have another record out? On the opening track “I Am Right on Time,” the similarities are uncanny: the jut-jaw baritone, the cryptic profundities, the modest motorik pulse driving an illusion of endless ascension. In time, though, the millennial touches of Jack Antonoff reveal themselves: a sense of shared disillusion (“Our ballroom bliss/Counterfeit, under-extended”), a stray “whoo!” in the background. Even the downers on a Bleachers record can feel like a party might break out.Antonoff and his crew are still trying to answer the plea from the last album’s title. There, Bleachers’ best grooves were tied up in stadium-made swirl. It was a world where Talking Heads headlined Live Aid: the quirks vanished at scale. But on Bleachers—especially on the singles-heavy first half—the band is simply playing for each other, much to the songs’ benefit. “Jesus Is Dead” is a dispatch from New York that wistfully namechecks Longwave and the venerated dance-punk label DFA, but the track moves with the economy of prime Strokes; instead of cresting on some post-punk swell, Antonoff dials up a dual-sax solo. They play the rapid-fire list song “Modern Girl”—think “It’s the End of the World As We Know It” crossed with “Dancing in the Dark,” but listenable—with the verve and cross-stage winks of a seasoned bar band.But most bar bands aren’t fronted by a three-time Grammy-winning Producer of the Year. Jack big-ups a couple of the boys on “Modern Girl,” a nice gesture if a little low-effort; later, when someone yells “fuck off!” after Antonoff puts some “venue herbs” on blast, it lands with the dutifulness of an employee posting a positive Glassdoor review. As with any of Antonoff’s A-list production jobs, the Bleachers project is as much mythological as personal. So when an actual A-lister—Lana Del Rey, who’s mastered both of those dimensions—shows up to duet on “Alma Mater,” he goes for broke. The pair race down the Jersey Turnpike, screaming about Balenciaga, fake-crying to Tom Waits, throwing shirts out the window. The result is surprisingly blissful: cocooned in a puttering sophistipop arrangement that recalls Antonoff’s recent work with the 1975, Jack and Lana luxuriate in the chaos.Those hijinks aside, the fourth Bleachers record marks a conscious shift in subject matter. Previous albums drew from the unimaginable loss of Antonoff’s younger sister to brain cancer. Even at his most life-affirming, there was a mania familiar to anyone who’s endured something similar. Now he’s trying something different. “I’m not numb to the pain,” says skate legend-turned-motivational speaker Rodney Mullen at the end of the sweetly desperate ballad “Ordinary Heaven,” as Jack mutters along. “I would argue I’m more conscious of it than anyone else. But I’m also more conscious of what that gives me.” “Ordinary Heaven,” like the album’s outlook as a whole, takes inspiration from Antonoff’s wife, the actor Margaret Qualley. She makes a left-channel cameo on “Call Me After Midnight,” an adult-contemporary R&B strutter that exchanges one Bruce for another (Hornsby). Co-produced by Kevin Abstract and Romil Hemnani, the song is Antonoff at his best: chameleonic, tender, and casually grandiose. “They don’t want you, they want your faith,” he howls at the climax. Then he cuts himself off to answer the door.",Pop,6.4
410,"With the energy and conviction of a debut, the intuitive singer-songwriter returns with a dazzling folk album that contends with the long grip of grief and the belief that it will steadily loosen. Not so long ago, Hannah Frances’ dazzling voice often got lost in the sounds around it. At the start of 2018’s White Buffalo, a fingerpicked acoustic guitar was enough to swallow her poignant opening words about the ways that time steals our chances to love. Frances was still new to her 20s, a recent art school dropout who had decamped to New York a year after her father died of a heart attack. The songs soon emptied out of her, three records’ worth in a little more than a year. As she lurked beneath the layers, she seemed to be hiding as much from herself as from the listener, trying to untangle a knot of woes in the private recesses of a quiet song. There were still traces of this during 2021’s very good Bedrock, her relatively loud and full-band contemplation of how to find redemption amid life’s wreckage. She would disappear behind the music, as if she still needed the space to sort these things out for herself.There are no such retreats on Keeper of the Shepherd, Frances’ epiphanic fifth album but the first in which she fully grapples with what is possible when we finally step out of grief and into the rest of our lives. Her voice—a commanding alto one moment and a swan-diving soprano the next, often multi-tracked to give her words the credence of gospel—remains always at the fore, leading a compact band that can be as quiet as a creek or as rapturous as a waterfall. A triumph of perseverance, of trying to live alongside your fear rather than always underneath it, Keeper of the Shepherd has the inexorable energy of an auspicious debut, a set of songs that have simply been waiting to spring forth. Imagine if the love-riven Sharon Van Etten of Epic and Tramp had retreated, as Frances has, to the maple woods of Vermont rather than the concrete wilds of Los Angeles; it might sound a lot like the mighty Keeper of the Shepherd.Many years ago, Frances found that the alternate guitar tunings that Joni Mitchell used enhanced her relationship with the instrument, augmenting her intuitive connection with its strings. Her work lingered in that gilded folk space for years, and she occasionally returns to it in these seven songs. With its big, open chords and subtly bent notes galloping beneath her, “Floodplain” feels a little like Mitchell and John Fahey sitting beside a campfire during a springtime road trip through the American Southwest. The long, interwoven phrases of “Woolgathering” suggest some unused Hejira skeleton, as if Mitchell never found the proper riposte to stick inside its graceful lope.",Folk,8.2
411,"The Philadelphia rockers sign to Third Man, try a few new tricks, and kick out the jams with some diminishing returns. It is a blessing and curse when a band nails their sound right away. Sheer Mag brought their devotion to the sound of ’70s hard rock to a new generation with their much-hyped mid-2010s EPs, thanks to lead guitarist Kyle Seely’s gleeful and technically impressive playing and singer Tina Halladay’s anthemic sing-a-long melodies that could unite a rally or a karaoke bar. You’d have to squint to see their songwriting evolve from those EPs to their official 2017 debut, Need to Feel Your Love, and 2019’s relatively clean-cut A Distant Call, where the main differences felt like Sheer Mag were able to afford nicer studios. On Playing Favorites, the studio still sounds nice, and the riffs and howls will still get cheers from the rock clubs. There are even a few modest attempts at sonic experimentation. Ironically, Playing Favorites’ few tries at changing up the Sheer Mag formula show the limits of this band’s abilities (or willingness) to evolve from the sound many people fell in love with a decade ago.Playing Favorites is a how-to-survive-in-this-world album, full of declarations someone might make after the strictest of pandemic lockdowns gives them time to pause and think about how they would like to be treated. In the case of the album opener and title track, Halladay’s first step into happiness is to pack up the van and ride into the sunset with her friends, “Just like the old days, playing the same old songs.” A call to friendship, but maybe Sheer Mag is also getting ahead of the critics who may accuse them of repetition: What’s wrong with playing the same old songs?Still, “Playing Favorites” is a wonderful showcase for Matt Palmer, Sheer Mag’s rhythm guitarist and lyricist who gives the band its power-pop canvas for the other members to add their heavy rock flourishes. “Eat It and Beat It” has several dirty, prog-like mini movements that drive Halladay to kick and scream through her tough love for the phony rockers who need to learn when to quit. As usual, the feeling of her vocals is more compelling than its literal meaning.These opening songs are strong enough. Every descriptor you could imagine to describe Sheer Mag here—shimmering guitars, heavy riffs, classic rock boogie—could also apply to every past Sheer Mag album. Most of Playing Favorites struggle to add new sounds to their vocabulary. After a brief acoustic intro, “Don’t Come Lookin’” steps back into the Sheer Mag mid-tempo safety zone of a tipsy 12-bar twang that hinges on generic lyrics about a wishing well. “Golden Hour” also reads generic and worse, sounds muddy and loud, destroying any sense of dynamics that help build up a song’s tension and release. “Tea on the Kettle” is pretty with its power ballad twinkles and some actual lyrical imagery (“The old dog cried behind the bus/You stopped the car cause you hated to see him alone”) and “Paper Time” might be power-pop’s newest peak when it comes to songs about waiting for the newspaper to arrive. However, by the time we get to these songs towards the end of the album, the fatigue of listening to familiar riffs and howls starts to set in.",Rock,6.7
412,"The California producer and New York rapper collaborate on a contemplative and captivating lo-fi rap record about moving through this life and into the next. California producer klwn cat and New York rapper Sunmundi each inhabit the intersection where the experimental reflection of Ka and Navy Blue collide with the minimal charm of Roc Marciano and Preservation. cat cites Navy and J Dilla as influences on his style, but the beats he’s been making since 2022’s sphynx, vol. 1 have matured beyond homage, becoming liquid and enveloping. Meanwhile, Sunmundi’s flow, which started out with a strictly metered delivery, has slowly loosened to match his melancholic prose, earning shoutouts from billy woods. After a handful of collaborations, they both emerge with energy and talent to burn on Lived and Born, their first full-length together. Here, they produce and rap like they’re digging themselves out of shallow graves with their teeth.Lived and Born flirts with ideas of reincarnation and digs through Sunmundi’s past, present, and future to grasp at the tether between them. But even when the ruminations feel inescapable, he blazes through them with the precision—and triple the urgency—of Long Island rapper-producer Lungs. When, near the end of early standout “Capitulation,” he says “Happiness nowadays just don’t hit the same,” the thought is stacked with playground memories, the healing qualities of brown butter pierogies, and a bottomless appetite for each new chapter of life. “Late-stage capitulation is a motherfuckin’ sonuvabitch!” he says in one echoing gulp of breath, channeling the time-conscious frenzy of Back to the Future’s Doc Brown. klwn cat’s flutes and soft drum rolls trill in the background, giving Sunmundi’s words the weight of biblical edicts.That’s the core of the pair’s chemistry: cat’s mournful loops split the difference between the gothic horror of Ingmar Bergman and the smoky ambience of film noir, while Sunmundi’s bars scurry through them, frantic but determined. Over the rumbling bass and violins of “New Pavement,” he’s piecing together head-busting aphorisms (“The only way to make sense of this world was to fabricate it”) while struggling to find the strength to breathe. On the sparkling “Answering the Call,” he’s swinging his feet from the spaceship and taking comfort in how much he doesn’t know. Sunmundi’s level of certainty in the world and in himself shifts from song to song—on the bittersweet “Everything Is Everything,” he switches from hopeful to despondent on a dime—but cat’s soundscapes ground him in the present.As often as Lived and Born trudges knowingly through existential crisis, the songs retain a youthful fervency that keeps them out of shadow. Depression is never too far away, but cat and Sunmundi refuse to be defeatists. Closing tracks “I Lived” and “Harbingers” explicitly make this case, their gleaming instrumentals unfurling like sunrises as Sunmundi keeps pace. “Lick the wound if you bleeding, but don’t develop a taste for your own trauma,” he says on the latter. Many in the indie rap lane are sorting through trauma in search of a more edifying tomorrow; for cat and Sunmundi, reincarnation means sculpting new lives from the ashes of their old ones.",Rap,7.4
413,"The hardcore band’s sixth album is short, fast, and misanthropically funny, full of scuzz-punk tantrums about the indignities of modern life. There was a time when every mundane indignity of adult life had a corresponding Seinfeld episode. Now those indignities inspire grimly funny Pissed Jeans songs. Demoralized about our dehumanizing healthcare industry? There’s a Pissed Jeans song for that. Depressed about going bald in early adulthood? There’s a Pissed Jeans song ranting about that. Fantasizing about your blowhard project manager’s death? These freaks have a song for you, too.Two decades into their career, the Pennsylvania-bred punks are the poets laureate of pathetic men flailing against their own obsolescence. (That’s a compliment—to portray a character is not to concern yourself with the character’s likability.) On Half Divorced, their first album in seven years, Pissed Jeans haven’t overhauled their sound or reinvented themselves or “matured” as artists so much as they have amassed a new inventory of modern miseries to turn into scuzz-punk tantrums, from catalytic converter theft (“[Stolen] Catalytic Converter”) to crippling medical debt (""Sixty-Two Thousand Dollars in Debt"").Let other bands address the political and structural causes of late-capitalist decline; with his guttural howl, vocalist Matt Korvette has always been better at sweating the small stuff. He’s in fine form on “Helicopter Parent,” yowling about the micromanaging tendencies of bougie parents (“Why ya breathing down the back of their neck!?”) over a sludge-metal riff that oozes like overflowing sewage. It may be the funniest song about parenting since Randy Newman’s “Love Story (You and Me).” The band further indulges its comedic side on “Everywhere Is Bad,” an amusingly specific travelogue of ills. The playful call-and-response segment—enumerating different cities and the reasons they suck (“Philadelphia/Trashy streets/San Francisco/There’s no more freaks!”)—evokes the humor-infused punk of the Dead Milkmen more than any hardcore reference points.If Half Divorced has a claim at being Pissed Jeans’ funniest album, it’s not their most musically stimulating. “Helicopter Parent” and “Junktime,” a half-spoken yarn about toxic waste fallout, are exceptions—sludgy, slow-burning eruptions that showcase the band’s talent for tension and release, goaded by Korvette’s throat-scraping anti-charisma. The rest of the record plays it relatively straight, with quick and dirty hardcore outbursts like “Killing All the Wrong People” and “Alive With Hate” that summon plenty of bludgeoning energy but little in the way of memorable riffs or refrains.The last two tracks evoke a kind of aggro pop-punk: a cover of “Monsters” by undersung Florida punks Pink Lincolns and an uncharacteristically anthemic original, “Moving On.” The latter sounds like it could be a straightforward divorce song until you read the lyrics and realize it’s about a guy swearing off selling his used underwear online. Maybe that’s the album’s unifying theme—trying to cling to your dignity in the world that capitalism has wrought.",Rock,7.3
414,"The rapper’s new mixtape is a jewel of DC street rap, recounting hood epics and hustler origin stories with a potent sense of realism. Decades of neglect and slashed funding have pushed the United States’ public housing system into crisis. Increased privatization, mass renovations, and sweeping demolitions have displaced longtime tenants while fattening the pockets of corporations and landlords, whose agendas treat locals as an afterthought. Nearly every major city in the US has their own horror stories as a result—including Washington, DC, where Paco Panama was raised. He grew up in a project in the southeastern part of town, which he says was torn down around 2020. Paco was rapping before that, but with nothing left to do after it was razed, he started spending more time in the studio. His hustler rap is an unglamorous, morally complex firsthand account of an ecosystem full of drug dealers, addicts, lookout boys, and cops. It’s political even if it’s not heavy-handed.Paco Panama’s first mixtape of the year, Southside Sopranos, drops him directly into that unrelenting world. Southside Sopranos isn’t quite as weighty as last year’s breakout mixtape The Wire Vol. 1, named after the Baltimore-set HBO show. That’s mostly because of The Sopranos theme, which is showcased in the form of goofy, grating Italian gangster skits by hometown comedian Chico Bean that are headscratchingly more Don Corleone than Tony Soprano. (He wishes he was as funny as Master P’s Black Italian character in the MP Da Last Don movie.) But Paco is a colorful and evocative rapper, stuffing tracks with vignettes of neighborhood dealings and hard-earned life lessons that only sometimes veer into empty clichés. All of these tales are related with the worn-down voice of a longtime bruiser just shootin’ the shit on a stoop; the breezy, soulful tint on the doomsday bounce of DMV street rap helps emphasize that mood.His stories are vivid and unfurl gradually, making them feel as dramatic as movie clips. Whether he’s lining the interior of his whip with bricks before a long out-of-state drive on “Contraband,” or detailing the intricacies of traphouse shifts on “DC House,” the scenes feel complete instead of blurry. Sometimes he evokes the weathered Detroit duo Los and Nutty, whose dope dealing epics are no doubt a heavy inspiration. But Paco branches out by focusing on the consequences of the lifestyle, one that he’s remorseful about when he’s not hypnotized by hood glory. (It makes sense that one of the first rap songs he knew was Scarface’s psychologically conflicted “Born Killer.”) Occasionally he’s cold-blooded about it all, like when he raps “Fuck yo’ problems, see a therapist” on “Supreme Clientele.” Yet more often than not, you can feel the weight on his shoulders: “Life will fuck you up, you gotta adapt to it/Everyday struggles I had to trap through it,” he says a few bars into “Time Will Tell.” The mixtape runs nearly an hour; the moral complexity of what he has to do to survive rears its head again and again.",Rap,7.4
415,"The veteran singer-songwriter made his name penning songs for other people. The classic rock and adult contemporary of his first album of original material in 18 years sound slick yet curiously anonymous. “Certain things get clearer/In the rearview mirror,” sings Albert Hammond on “Looking Back,” a song deep into Body of Work, the first album of original material the veteran singer-songwriter has released in 18 years. A hitmaker who ceded the spotlight to his songs, Hammond built a catalog that could sustain a career without a need for new tunes. Save perhaps for “It Never Rains in Southern California,” a satiny smash from 1972 that was his only single to enter the Billboard Top Ten, all of Hammond’s tunes are best known as renditions by other artists. The Hollies turned “The Air That I Breathe” into a soft-rock perennial, Leo Sayer brought the ballad “When I Need” You” to the top of the charts in both the UK and U.S., and Whitney Houston chose “One Moment in Time” as her contribution to the 1988 Summer Olympics. The key title in Hammond’s catalog is “To All the Girls I’ve Loved Before,” a collaboration with lyricist Hal David that became a global blockbuster when covered by Julio Iglesias and Willie Nelson in 1984. With one foot planted firmly in American corn and the other in cloying Continental sophistication, Iglesias and Nelson revealed Hammond’s grasp of the international language of schmaltz: His heightened sentimentality knows no borders.Hammond is deliberately looking outward on Body of Work. He recorded the album in Nashville and Berlin, then reunited with his old songwriting partner John Bettis—who co-wrote “One Moment in Time” with him—to help him finish a surplus of ideas he developed during a particularly tumultuous time in his life. In the years leading up to the album, Hammond divorced his wife and struggled with vocal atrophy brought on by an immune disease. He responds to those trials by confronting the clamor of the modern world—albeit through the prism of a showbiz lifer who feels at home surrounded by high-end recording gear.Relaxing into the comfort of studio craft, Hammond dabbles in a variety of styles, striking a note of insistent defiance with the arena rock of “Don’t Bother Me Babe” and relying upon his adult-contemporary skills for “Somebody’s Child”; he counters those unabashedly commercial plays with such gentle love tunes as “Bella Blue” and “Young Llewelyn,” whose narrative balladeering hearkens back to Hammond’s folk roots. An able, old-school professionalism flattens these shifts in tone and direction, helping the album glide unperturbed from one song to another. What cuts through the gloss are lyrical barbs, with Hammond taking potshots at “social addiction” and “Chinese phones” in full Boomer-yells-at-cloud mode; the cynicism of “The American Flag,” with its swipes at “the money brokers” and “the media… just propaganda clowns,” is more Roger Waters than Woody Guthrie.Despite these occasionally acid undertones, Body of Work veers towards hopefulness, conveying a sunny disposition in its unrepentant slickness and offering a couple of welcome detours from its deliberately classy soft rock. “Like They Do Across the River” bops to a reconstituted Bo Diddley beat; the Beatlesque bounce of “Gonna Be Alright” is punctuated by an exhortation to “Fuck all night/Fuck all day”; “Looking Back” is incongruously draped in neon vaporwave trappings; and the acoustic blues of “Goodbye LA” ends the proceedings on an unexpectedly ramshackle note, warmer and looser than its predecessors. These lighthearted departures give Body of Work a needed pulse and also reveal the sense of anonymity inherent in Hammond’s universality; instead of sounding at home everywhere, it’s curiously rootless.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

416,"The Australian noise musician has long used the guitar as a textural element, but here he puts it front and center, sculpting a claustrophobic landscape out of chugging metal riffs. What if 4'33"" went to 11? That’s one thought experiment posed by Ben Frost’s radical new album of deconstructed metal, in which the riffs are only as important as the silence that yawns between them. Strange things happen in the interstices: Microsecond-long reverb tails assume an almost physical form, jutting out against the vacuum in eerie bas-relief. Wisps of electricity sweep through filters and phasers, leaving smudgy fingerprints. But turn it up loud enough to hear those whisper-soft details and risk your neighbors’ wrath. This is a brutally loud album, its low end practically steroidal; downstrokes are accompanied by walloping thwacks, rendering the guitar a percussive instrument as much as a tonal one. Few records—certainly few records that take their cues from the heaviest strains of metal—can boast such a vast dynamic range.The guitar has long played a central role in the Australian-born, Iceland-based musician’s work. On his 2009 breakout, By the Throat, one of the first sounds we hear is a gravelly crunch familiar from metal and hardcore. While the arrangements cycle through strings, horns, choir, electronics, and even wolf growls, the telltale rumble of guitar distortion is never far off; the whole album feels perfumed by the smoke of burning Marshall stacks. Frost leaned even further into both metal grandeur and textural swirl on A U R O R A’s fuzzed-out snapshots of the sublime. But he’s never foregrounded the guitar quite like he does here. To create Scope Neglect he enlisted bassist Liam Andrews, of Australian post-punks My Disco, and Greg Kubacki, guitarist of the Long Island progressive metal band Car Bomb. It’s Kubacki’s playing that gives the album its unique character: His chugging, disembodied riffs are treated as seedlings, nourished by Frost’s electronic treatments and left to blossom in the arid emptiness, like desert flowers sprung from sere volcanic soil.Framing atonal bursts of guitar against inky silence, the album begins as a tug-of-war between being and nothingness. More prosaically, it sounds like someone trying out gear in Guitar Center—the riffs feel tentative, disconnected, uninterested in the sort of meaning-making that takes place when phrases are woven into an overarching continuity. But this Guitar Center would also have to be an anechoic chamber, a space so free of extraneous noise that you can hear the blood pumping through your own veins. That’s where the album’s profound strangeness begins to assert itself—in the dead spaces between the notes, the void that seems to swallow every sound as soon as it’s been made.",Electronic,7.3
417,"After a 2021 debut that used deconstructed club music as an autobiographical frame, the London-based producer’s rhythmically focused new EP feels less revealing—but just as disorienting. aya’s music is a dizzying tunnel system of itchy scratches, whispered desires, fried zaps, and unsettling sounds so tactile they seem to almost puncture your eardrum. At times, the London-based experimental producer’s debut, im hole, resembled gothic ASMR, or an open-heart dissection of a DAW, using tiny scalpels to pull apart, pinch, and rearrange sound layers. aya’s first solo release in over two years, Lip Flip, is a fundraiser for her facial feminization surgery, but it’s also a celebration. Where aya’s early tunes reimagined future-pop like SOPHIE as music for dissociation rather than dancing, this EP sounds built for a disorienting club night.There’s a screwy buoyancy to these songs that makes Lip Flip feel like a fusion of im hole and her more adrenalized 2023 collab EP with BFTT, the co-founder of their label YCO. aya’s ingredients often feel so characterful and carefully chosen as to seem anthropomorphic: bright dings that seem to smile, metallic synths winking like they’re playing patty cake. On “Essente!,” Ugandan rapper Ecko Bazz somersaults between flows and languages, his fierce energy transforming aya’s spasming beat into a neon playground. The title track, which features her alter ego LOFT, ratchets up tension with the tight pulse of a Two Shell song and then explodes into a barrage of abrasive yet groovy low end primed to jolt dancers into off-kilter movement.The biggest change on this EP is the near-absence of aya’s voice, which acted as a kind of phantom tour guide through im hole’s haunted manor house of deconstructed club. Lacking her characteristically surreal imagery and slurred rhymes, these tracks feel slightly more anonymous, as though any oddball with a knack for madcap sound structures could’ve patched them together. There’s also less of the negative space that made the hypnotically menacingsongs built around her creaky vocals and industrial bleeps sound like spoken-word poetry for a scary game score. Without any sort of narrative to cohere around, Lip Flip sometimes hits like a faceless flood of wonky sound shards—chipmunk gurgles and kawaii-ified chants on “Leftenant Keith,” clipped breaths and thudding drums on the title cut.But even with its frenetically pristine sheen, the music is still cheekily weird, the rhythm always shifting. Like the ’80s British band it’s named after, “Dexxy Is a Midnight Runner” is a tribute to an ADHD medication: lisdexamfetamine (commonly known as Vyvanse, apparently a favorite on the club circuit in Australia, where hard drugs are difficult to obtain). But its lattices of paranoid plinks and progressively eerier cut-up vocals are practically the inverse of Dexys’ passion pop. The final section’s fusillade of rubbery percussion makes me picture a single tiny pill sprinting at cartoonish speed like Crazy Frog. Whether the music is demented or danceable, aya’s killer ear for tone and texture makes every fragment sound hyperreal.",Electronic,7.0
418,"The TDE rapper’s sixth album is a daring feat that finds the sweet spot between comfort and anguish. It’s the rawest and most adventurous music of his career. Schoolboy Q spends “Cooties,” the eighth track on his sixth studio album, Blue Lips, marveling at the dimensions of the box he’s put himself in. “I know the feeling of being trapped from all the things that you built,” he yelps before ping-ponging between the spoils and troubles of the last 13 years. He’s working through trauma while dealing with haters; relishing the “house on the hill” where his daughters play soccer and he puffs ganja in the vestibule, but also worrying about school shootings and memories of betrayal. These are the nightmares of the outside world for Black folks folding into the creature comforts afforded by his rap stardom, and the paranoia and pride fight for space in the staggered elegance of Q’s delivery over scuzzy bass and drum slaps. As a whole, Blue Lips viciously prods at this sweet spot between comfort and anguish.If 2019’s CrasH Talk was the kickback where Q leisurely took stock of his position in life, then Blue Lips is a thumping raucous night out with the homies chased with a shot of existential dread. The album’s title refers to the phenomenon of being shocked into speechlessness, and over a decade into his journey, he remains shocked at all the fans, accolades, and prestige he’s racked up. But instead of the occasionally maudlin poolside reflection of CrasH Talk, Blue Lips fully embraces the dissonance of pairing the morose with the manic. Q sounds like he needs to get all his ideas out in case he won’t have the chance to do it again. Every side of the California rapper—the former Hoover Street Crip, the iced-out spitter, the horny golf-playing father of two—is given room to stretch and ruminate and stomp his way across the rawest and most adventurous music of his career.More than any other Top Dawg Entertainment artist, Q has thrived on hairpin musical turns. 2014’s Oxymoron and 2016’s Blank Face LP, in particular, are constantly molting, revealing a delicate ear for sequencing that brings variety while helping the experience stick to the ribs. He may not reach the conceptual heights of a Kendrick, but he doesn’t need to. He’s supremely gifted at balancing party jams and grizzled storytelling tracks with cinematic flair. Blue Lips keeps that structure while being bolder and weirder. Songs like the Rico Nasty-featuring “Pop” end abruptly and smash cut into the next without warning; songs that have smoother mass-appeal tendencies grind up against unvarnished soul loops and trippy drum ’n bass freakouts. The slinking “Movie” is ceded entirely to LA rapper AzChike, who turns it into a creaking Cali street rap funhouse. Intro track “Funny Guy,” with its trilling flutes and technicolor guitars and choir, sounds more like an Avalanches B-side than anything a disciple of Kurupt or Suga Free might touch, yet here Q is, crooning about money bags, sex, and kicking rowdy fans out of venues. There’s a bracing, madcap quality to Blue Lips, proof that he still knows how to surprise listeners by folding off-kilter influences into head-nodders and rocket fuel.",Rap,8.3
419,"The guitar icon’s first solo album in 19 years confronts heartbreak and loss with intensely melodic, disarmingly straightforward songs that feel as loose and casual as old friends. Mary Timony always sounds like she’s in control. Even at its most exuberant—the zoned-out trills and slanted poetry of Helium’s The Magic City, the hot-rod anthems of Ex Hex—her music exudes a calm, impenetrable confidence. She delivers her vocal melodies in a conversational register, holding her highest highs and lowest lows in reserve. As a guitarist, her riffs and solos tend to turn and bend with a bemused smirk; she plays like she wants you to know she’s holding her power back. “In her songs, sadness and alienation were not embodied, they were subterranean, they were alien, transferred and transformed,” Sleater-Kinney’s Carrie Brownstein once wrote.On Untame the Tiger, Timony’s first true solo album in 19 years, sadness and alienation are present on the surface. They’re clearly legible. They’re intensely human. Timony wrote Untame the Tiger following the end of her long-term relationship, while she was caring for her elderly parents. Her father died near the beginning of recording; her mother passed near the end. The searing light of grief sometimes brings with it a fresh emotional clarity, and whether related or not, the songs here are disarmingly straightforward. “A brand-new day, it still hurts like hell,” she sings on the very first song. “What did I get for loving you?” she asks near the album’s end. You can see her eyes narrow as she mutters the answer: “Nothing but pain.”Still, it doesn’t feel right to call Untame the Tiger a sad record. She’s made those before: Her first two solo albums, 2000’s Mountains and 2002’s The Golden Dove, couch their melancholy in fantastical imagery and occasionally dress it up in antique instrumentation. They’re also, according to Timony, “miserable records about being depressed.” That may be a bit unfair, but Untame the Tiger shows that she’s determined to avoid ever making depressing music again. Even as it confronts sadness, the album is spritely, frequently bright, as intensely melodic as Ex Hex’s triumphant Rips and more playful than a record this heartbroken probably should be. Most people run a drum kit through a flanger because it sounds badass when you’re blasting cigs with the boys, not because they’re suddenly alone in their search for fulfillment.On Untame the Tiger, Timony draws ideas and sounds from throughout her career together: the twang and drone of odd tunings and unusual instruments mingle with fuzzed-out solos and starry-eyed pop songs like mismatched old friends doing their best to be supportive. It gives the album a looseness and curiosity that, combined with the swagger of her guitar-playing, makes even the bleakest moments feel open and warm. The clarity of opener “No Thirds”’ melody, and the obvious pleasure with which she rips her lead, give it a sense of purpose, the way having a big cry can leave you feeling more grounded—still aching, but exhaling, too. “Now I wanna feel what I’ve never never felt before,” she sings. Like sunbeams through an overcast sky, her inherent melodicism can’t help but punch its way through.",Rock,7.6
420,"With playful marimbas and chintzy MIDI instruments, the Polish ambient experimentalist’s tribute to urban exploration sits somewhere between reality and reimagining. Walking around Warsaw has an uncanniness unique among European cities. Its very architecture creates a sort of illusion; after the city’s old town burned to the ground in World War II, its citizens came together to reconstruct many of its historic sites, even reusing rubble from buildings that had been lost. Paintings by the Italian landscape artist Bernardo Bellotto were used as a reference point, his use of camera obscura offering highly detailed depictions of structures that had been reduced to ash. But this same method resulted in slight inaccuracies, causing dissonance for those who remember the city as it actually stood before the war. Seeing these centuries-old buildings constructed from memory in person, one encounters a strange sensation: Is this really how it felt to stand next to, say, the city’s Royal Castle when its paint was still fresh? Or is this closer to a reimagining of that feeling?Staś Czekalski’s debut likewise sees Warsaw through a surreally half-simulated lens. Recorded upon moving to the city from Poznań, the album documents the Polish composer’s explorations of Warsaw, uncovering new wonders around every corner. Czekalski’s music has a lullaby lilt—his marimbas playfully bob up and down like tadpoles, while dinky MIDI guitars strum as if plucked from a daydream. Czekalski colors his music with a similar restrained touch as Mondoj labelmates Piotr Kurek and G.S. Sultan, calling to mind the meditative grooves of Andras Fox crossed with Kate NV’s silly-brained exercises. Gently carving sparse shapes from silence, Czekalski lets each sound bounce off the others like floating objects in an old desktop screensaver.Przygody translates to “Adventures” in Polish, and Czekalski imbues his music with this wide-eyed sense of searching, fixating over every small sound like a child turning over pebbles. On “Pogoda ducha,” he jams out on a simple pizzicato motif, layering one click-clocking woodblock after another over its delightfully cartoonish echo. Czekalski relishes in the smooth surfaces of his MIDI instruments, whether it’s the nylon spa guitars that waft through “Koniec lata,” or the Casio-like keys of “Dim Lounge,” which putter along over amateur drum machines straight from the GameCube era of Animal Crossing. The further the album goes along, the greater the empty space becomes: the pan pipes of “Mini Farmer” and “Muzeum Ewolucji” seem to call out into silence, their unnaturally breathy tone taking on an absurd psychedelic tinge.Though Przygody doesn’t exactly fit in the new-age bin, Czekalski’s approach to texture doesn’t feel far off from the pitch-shifting wooziness of modern zoners like Cole Pulice and Lynn Avery. His toylike sounds play almost like an heir to the Mark Mothersbaugh school of electronic whimsy (the arpeggiating synthesizers of “Pogoda ducha” and “Zamek” wouldn’t sound out of place on the Rugrats soundtrack). At points, Przygody can become comfy to the point of sameness—its biggest shakeup comes on the distorted “zegarek,” whose looped bongo groove and warping synth samples disrupt the album’s cutesy calm. In moments like these when Czekalski journeys deeper into his own chintzy sonics, he uncovers a peculiar resonance within their artifice.",Experimental,7.0
421,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit the ’90s alt-rock band’s debut, a tender and sincere record that made the band famous while they grappled with tragedy. The guitarist who wrote the album’s biggest songs isn’t on the cover of Gin Blossoms’ New Miserable Experience, but the tour van he once poured sugar into the gas tank of is. By the time the band had finished their long, uncertain climb to the top of the charts, they’d fired Doug Hopkins, and he spent the rest of his short life rueing their success and decrying their betrayal. He’d founded the group and written half their album, including the two achingly personal hits that made them famous. They were profiting off of not only his work but his experiences—his suffering, fuck-ups, and humiliations.New Miserable Experience went on to go quadruple platinum, and the album cover was just the last in the endless series of do-overs and recalibrations it took to make the record such a sleeper hit. A first pressing of the CD featured uninspired artwork of the Arizona desert, a nod to the band’s roots in Tempe, Arizona, a college town far off the music industry’s radar. The revised cover, while similarly junky, was at least more personal, reflecting the band’s faces in the windshield of the van in which they’d logged years on the road while they waited to see if their long-shot record deal with A&M would pan out. By 1992, that deal was looking like a bust. A first attempt to record a full-length had failed, yielding instead only an EP of usable material, Up and Crumbling, which was released in 1991 to little notice. The sessions for New Miserable Experience had also been a debacle, largely because of Hopkins’ worsening alcoholism, and the meager sales and lackluster reviews that greeted the album upon release suggested A&M had funded another flop. But the label, likely sensing the opening created by the zeitgeist-shifting success of Nirvana a year earlier, remained committed to breaking their single “Hey Jealousy,” an incongruously upbeat romp about a fuckup drunkenly trying to reconcile with an ex under the guise of needing a place to crash. A&M commissioned three videos for the song, each with a vastly higher budget, before one finally passed muster with the gatekeepers at MTV. Perhaps it was fitting that it took a few tries to make the “Hey Jealousy” video stick, since the song itself was a redo. The band had recorded it years prior on their 1989 independent release Dusted, in a far more shambolic form that belied their early debt to the Replacements, with a blitzing cadence and a basement punk band’s sense of rhythm. That they buried the song as track 9 on the back of the record suggests they hadn’t fully realized what a gem they’d written. New Miserable Experience producer John Hampton certainly did. Spruced up with a slower tempo that accentuated the euphoria of its riff and the sting of its lyrics, the song’s major-label makeover crunches, sparkles, and soars. It’s such an undeniable hit that you have to wonder why it took so much arm-twisting to make programmers play it.New Miserable Experience beefed up the band’s guitars just enough that Gin Blossoms could pass as part of the early-’90s modern rock boom, although at its heart their sound was a throwback to the crystalline jangle of ’80s college rock, with a heartland tinge that felt old-fashioned in the wake of grunge. Their true differentiator was the blue-eyed lilt and unabashed softness of frontman Robin Wilson, an uncommonly tame singer during an era of furious, loud ones. Compared to the cage match roars of Kurt Cobain, Layne Staley, and Chris Cornell, Wilson sang as if he was serenading a baby bird he was nursing back to health with an eye dropper. Yet that tenderness, that wimpy sincerity, was key to the friction at the foundation of their sound: Their guitars were pretty and their vocals were sweet, but they sang about the kind of hard living mostly found in Charles Bukowski novels and old country songs. Ahead of acts like Third Eye Blind and Matchbox 20, Gin Blossoms had recognized a market for deceptively sordid minivan music. That lived-in, flaws-and-all realism elevated them over most of the flood of tame, light alternative and post-grunge bands that followed in their wake—bands like Tonic and Sister Hazel, which never had the same understanding of how a pleasant song can still capture shittiness and moral ambiguity.",Rock,8.1
422,"On an interconnected suite of pieces for pipe organ, brass ensemble, and chamber choir, the composer balances minimalist intensity with sacred music’s depth of feeling. A held chord on a pipe organ can signal a looming arrival—of a Boris Karloff character or, in a brighter register, the bride-to-be. Such a stately chord encapsulates anticipation. It makes its listener cognizant of waiting, because the instrument can sustain such a chord forever. That is how pipe organs function, and it is one reason they are perfect for churchly representations of heavenly—that is, eternal—choruses.By contrast, if you hear a sustained note on a piano or saxophone, let alone sung by a singer, you know it has a finite lifespan: until the instrument—or lungs—give way. The limitless sustain of an organ is an innate superpower. Since you sense the organ’s stamina is inexhaustible, you know the player has complete discretion as to when whatever happens next will … actually … occur.When that musician is Kali Malone, be prepared to wait—and, following momentary activity, to wait again. Malone is a poet of attenuation. The compositions on All Life Long proceed at the considered pace of a chess-by-mail match. Each step is a marker of choices made. As a listener, you pay attention not just to those steps but to the overtones that fill the air in between. Each chord is a burr of wonderment. To listen closely is to find compositions within, as waveforms meld, tones circle, and patterns shift with a dynamism initially belied by the seeming stasis.You’ve heard of forest bathing? Welcome to cathedral bathing, to the dark romance of the steady descents amid “Fastened Maze,” and to the methodical harmonic brick-laying of “Prisoned on Watery Shore.” Malone’s organ works can feel as if she is spelunking through cavernous frequencies, seeking to understand just how far the darkness extends. She maps territory fastidiously, and then serves up her field work in composition form. At the most extreme, she might finish a song—in this case, the title track—by holding its closing chord for more than a full minute. (One foresees the inevitable scandale when a Spotify bot accidentally eradicates such a track as part of its war on white noise.) Even when Malone’s compositions adopt a more human timescale, as on “Moving Forward,” the impact is heady.Stephen O’Malley, of doom-metal band Sunn O))), accompanies Malone on the album, which is released by his record label Ideologic Organ. The pairing makes perfect sense: The two share penchants for dense harmonies, exotic tunings, and ceremonial grandeur. It is a sign of Malone’s decade-long maturation as an artist that, at 30, she has come to make practical use of the drones that she once let unfurl on their own. The wooly sawtooth waves that filled out last year’s Does Spring Hide Its Joy brought to mind the raga-inspired tonalities of La Monte Young. Here they are raw material for more traditional, if still funereal, compositions. Malone’s latest work challenges today’s drone musicians to retain the delectable, psychedelic whir of drones while using them in the service of something melodically engaging.",Experimental,8.3
423,"The Atlanta singer-songwriter’s latest record taps into freewheeling acoustic jam-session vibes. It’s ostensibly a breakup album, but rather than spilling her guts, she sounds more reserved than ever. Don’t ask Faye Webster about her dog. She will only reveal his breed off the record, and she’s suspicious that locals in her town have already learned too much. “My neighbors know his name/Thought that was weird but I’m over it,” she sings halfway through her fifth album, through a vocoder’s digital mask. Her protective impulses extend beyond her beloved pet. The Atlanta singer-songwriter finds ways to experience music away from the public eye, dropping in unannounced as the bassist for local punks Upchuck and ducking into the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra at the last minute; the latter habit inspired the title of her latest record. On Underdressed at the Symphony, she frequently steps back from the mic and allows her band, or occasionally just silence, to fill in the empty space. It’s a record about hiding—from heartbreak, from fame—that, whether through vocal processing or omission, fittingly obscures Webster from view.Webster began building a richer sound around her wispy, honeyed vocals on her 2022 EP Car Therapy Sessions, where she brought in a 20-piece orchestra to cover songs from her previous two albums. For Webster, the EP was a chance to lose herself in the music swirling around her confessional songs: “I would just forget lyrics or forget where I am because I was listening to [the orchestra] play,” she said. But where that album accentuated the ethereal qualities of her songs, Underdressed at the Symphony emphasizes the naturalism of her songwriting, building melodies with a grand piano, a drum kit, and an electric guitar.Gone are the sweeping synths that provided a cushion for her diaristic musing; this time, Webster leans into the acoustic sounds of a freewheeling jam session. Her backing players—many of whom have been performing with her since her early days—take steps into the foreground. On “Wanna Quit All the Time,” where she admits that “it’s the attention that freaks me out,” yawning pedal steel and sparkling Fender Rhodes seem to speak in her stead. Here, as on the similarly impressionistic “He Loves Me Yeah!,” she brings in a new voice to help further obscure her own: the sound of Wilco’s Nels Cline on the guitar, plucking out elegant solos where another verse might otherwise go. “Lifetime” stretches the repetition of a single phrase—“in a lifetime”—into something like jazz, Charles Garner’s drumming keeping a loose pace as Nick Rosen’s piano carries the song to its quiet conclusion. As Webster tells it, she didn’t want the song to end, so she asked Rosen to keep it going through subtle chord changes. The extended coda lets her linger in the shadow of his piano a little longer, an audience to her own private symphony.",Folk,7.5
424,"The 1998 collaborative album brought together a trio of legends from the worlds of ambient and chillout. It’s a placid but playful collection that is like nothing else in their repertoires. Haruomi Hosono was, in his words, “adrift in the sea of ambient music” in the ’90s. The multi-instrumentalist and producer had grown restless with the level of celebrity foisted upon him as one third of synth-pop supergroup Yellow Magic Orchestra and was desperate to take his career in another direction after the band decided to go their separate ways. He immediately went into hiding, ramping up work as a producer for other artists and obscuring his identity behind a network of different aliases. (Coming up with band names to camouflage himself, he says, was a fun hobby.) In further pursuit of new experiences, he spun up a series of labels on which he could collaborate with artists outside of his usual circles. As Hosono descended deeper into his latest obsessions, it seemed inevitable that he would collide with like-minded icons Mixmaster Morris and Jonah Sharp.The UK producers are legends in their own right. Morris made a name for himself as a prolific DJ, becoming a pioneer of ambient chillout, which gave ravers respite from the fast-paced environment of the main floor. Sharp, recording as Spacetime Continuum, occupied a similar zone—originally influenced by Chicago house and Detroit techno, his sound transformed as he retreated to the chill-out rooms and turned down the tempo. Both shared Hosono’s curiosity for music from all genres and corners of the globe, keeping everything from Balearic beats to atmospheric jazz in their toolkits.When the pair arrived at Hosono’s Quiet Lodge studio in 1997 to begin work on their collaborative album, Hosono gave them total freedom to play around. Operating on opposite circadian rhythms, the two recorded throughout the day and Hosono tuned the results while they slept. Hosono trusted the musicians to tinker with any instrument in his studio, with one exception—nobody could lay a hand on his Moog theremin. (“It’s a theremin,” Morris recalls slyly responding in the liner notes of the album. “I don’t need to touch it.”) On the title track, the bounty at their disposal becomes evident. Drum and cymbal samples intermittently skip over a shuffling pulse. Synthesized melodies stack up and rapidly fall away while kalimba-like tones occasionally roll in like a gently cresting wave. It’s placid but playful; it feels like they’re having a blast packing in as many sounds as they can.The English producers bring their otherworldly ability to bend time to the project. “Uchu Yuei (Swimming in Space)” sounds like what you’d expect from crossing the two musicians, but the building blocks are carefully placed; the track slowly gathers momentum as they tease the central rhythm, eventually letting it erupt into a skittish drum pattern. They push each other to new heights too, like on “Waraitake.” A cascade of fluttering notes underpins the almost 14-minute odyssey as it sweeps through various movements, like the endless prismatic patterns of a kaleidoscope. Digital glitches cut in and out, twisting into jagged waveforms. The beat picks up intensity until it becomes a heavy stomp, punctuated with reverb as if each hit of the drum pad has 10 tons of weight behind it. It’s like nothing in either of their discographies.",Electronic,8.2
425,"Two veteran electronic producers balance their club instincts with headier inclinations, fusing breakbeats, dub delay, and squalling electronic frequencies into side-winding psychedelic excursions. Wrecked Lightship make music that evokes great civilizations collapsing—crumbling structures and ruined grandeur, marble columns disappearing beneath sea-foam. Its imaginative scope is slightly distant from the music that the duo’s members made their names with. Laurie Osborne, best known as Appleblim, came up as a DJ at the foundational London dubstep nights FWD>> and DMZ and helmed the Skull Disco label alongside Shackleton; over the past decade and a half, he has flitted between house, techno, bass music, and hairsplitting hybrids of them all, typically with at least one eye on the dancefloor. Adam Winchester also has a background in dubstep, under the alias Wedge, though his more recent experimental music—in the duo Dot Product and under his own name—offers a hint of where Wrecked Lightship’s world-building tendencies might come from. Winchester’s industrial soundscaping suggests mainframes on the fritz and nuclear cores in meltdown, dystopian sci-fi fantasies playing out on a galactic scale.Antiposition is the duo’s third album in as many years. Where 2022’s Drowned Aquariums and 2023’s Oceans and Seas often veered into pure abstraction, Antiposition puts the percussion first. The improvisatory drift of the previous records has given way to a newfound focus; the bass and drums sound like they’ve been designed to stand up to the gale-force winds of the duo’s dubwise effects. The record’s intensity is surprising in part because of its context: The label releasing it, Peak Oil, is better known for the wispier, more amorphous sounds of artists like Purelink and Topdown Dialectic. Compared to their grainy fantasias, Antiposition is a tornado trailing debris in its wake.Across the album, the duo maintains a careful balance between club inclinations and more psychedelic effects. In the opener “Hex,” syncopated kicks and massive Reese bass call back to canonical tropes from the hardcore continuum, while flickering bleeps and bursts of white noise fill out the atmosphere. It’s both powerful and enveloping, a full-body blow that feels like an embrace. So is “Bizarre Servants,” whose thrumming drums—faintly reminiscent of Aphex Twin’s classic Bradley’s Robot EP—suggest taiko drummers in a wind tunnel. The pulse is tough and driving, but a gleaming, tape-warped synth melody adds an optimistic note to the mood of grim determination.“Sunken Skies” is the album’s heaviest track, growing from a quick-stepping dub rhythm into crisp breakbeats whose stuttering repetitions call back to the cut-up techniques of jungle’s pioneers. The bass threatens to crater the foundations, yet the high end is a dreamy wash of reverberant harp—an inspired contrast that sets the track apart from its predecessors in the breakbeat canon. Elsewhere, the two musicians mark their distance from club convention in subtler ways, like their preference for tension-building arrangements that withhold the Pavlovian pleasure of a climactic drop.",Electronic,7.7
426,"The Philadelphia rock band meets the moment with an essential, wide-ranging record that’s mouthy, messy, and self-assured. “To be feminine,” singer and guitarist Marisa Dabice recently said, speaking historically and contemporaneously, “is profane.” If Dabice and her bandmates celebrated that profanity over a decade ago when they christened their band Mannequin Pussy, their new album, I Got Heaven, is a bacchanal. It’s a mouthy, messy, self-assured record that seeks out conventions primarily to taunt them—genre and social conventions, sure, but also the conventional wisdom that says the delicate flower of a woman’s desire wilts if removed from its man-made greenhouse. Like Hole’s Live Through This, perhaps its closest antecedent, it revels in its most uncomfortable contradictions. It shows its ugliest face, and it always comes out on top. It’s hard to imagine an indie-rock record better suited for the moment.There is nothing on I Got Heaven like the slick romantic catharsis of “Drunk II,” the instant-classic single from the band’s 2019 album Patience. “I still love you, you stupid fuck,” Dabice sings to cap the first verse. That line became something like the band’s calling card, whether wittingly or not, the kind of punchline you spend an entire concert waiting to scream back. It’s vulnerable, almost affectionate, but its power relies on the protagonist’s feeling beholden to someone else against her wishes, if not her will. The stupid “fucks” on I Got Heaven, meanwhile, come from the act of fucking itself, experienced gleefully by people willing to risk their independence and self-sufficiency if it means getting theirs. When Dabice sings, “Rewind yourself, get me off, make me feel so elite,” it’s basically impossible to imagine her ever singing “Drunk II” again.I Got Heaven is at its best when Mannequin Pussy laugh their way past feeling conflicted. In the title track, Dabice is a dog panting at the knee of a stranger, equally ready to bite or hump depending on how things go. By the time the chorus comes around, though, she’s practically cooing. “Oh, I’m an angel,” she sings, “I was sent here to bring you company.” It’s not a negation of the fantasy—in the very next verse, she wonders aloud what it would be like if “Jesus himself ate my fucking snatch,” her voice nearly breaking into a moan—but an acknowledgment that even a woman playing the dominant hornball role still has to navigate the men who think the whole thing is their gift.Not that it stops her. “I keep all of my sugar where I know you like it best,” she promises in the very next song. She rides the chorus of “Loud Bark,” her voice rising as it builds toward the climax. “I’ve got a loud bark, deep bite,” she sings over and over, over and over, as the song approaches ecstasy. The twinned meanings of her words tumble over one another, vying for dominance: She wants you to fuck off, she wants to turn you on. Of course, screams of pleasure and screams of pain sometimes feel similar. Bites, too. Desire and fear, connection and protection—when they can’t be separated, why not go with what feels best? “Just tell me what you need!” she shouts in “Aching,” a gasp of frustration and a promise of service all at once. Nearly every line on I Got Heaven is both a come-on and a warning.",Rock,8.8
427,"A remarkable archival release captures rare vocal performances that the esteemed nun, composer, and pianist recorded in the late 1970s and early ’80s amid political turmoil in Ethiopia. Emahoy Tsege Mariam Gebru’s transcendent music is inextricably connected to resistance. The Addis Ababa-born nun, composer, and musician crafted her exquisite oeuvre as a way to give back to her community: The money she made from charity albums and concerts went to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, orphanages, and others who were displaced and devastated by war in her home country and abroad.Emahoy’s music is an alchemical blend of styles, incorporating fluttering piano, violin, and organ melodies informed by Ethiopian liturgical tradition, European classical music, and her own melismatic, circular melodies that give and bend at will. She began writing music in the 1940s and continued composing until her death last March, just before her 100th birthday, amid a renewed swell of interest in her work; even corporate overlords like Amazon and Walmart have synced her music in commercials. On the new posthumous album Souvenirs, released in collaboration by Emahoy’s family and Portland record label Mississippi with assistance from historian Thomas Feng, the artist’s astonishing compositions—filled out for the first time with vocals performed by Emahoy herself—strike the soul. Sung in Amharic and taped on cassette in her family’s home in Addis Ababa during a period of political unrest, these wending, inquisitive songs are a nourishing balm and an essential expansion of her available catalog.Recorded between 1977 and 1985, Souvenirs captures a shift in Emahoy’s songwriting that coincided with a turning point in her life. She and her family were restricted from leaving Ethiopia during the Red Terror, a campaign of repression that followed the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie by the Derg regime, a Marxist-Leninist military junta, in 1974. Emahoy had endured war since she was a child, having been born into a wealthy Ethiopian family who were exiled and became prisoners of war following Mussolini’s invasion of Ethiopia in 1935.Even before the invasion, music had coursed through her life as a twin flame. At age 6, she was sent to a Swiss boarding school where she studied violin and piano before returning to Ethiopia. After the war, she traveled to Cairo to study under Polish violinist Alexander Kontorowicz, honing her skill at rehearsals that could last as long as four hours. She was ordained as a nun in 1948 and spent the next decade at the Gishen Mariam monastery in northern Ethiopia, occasionally returning to see her family in Addis Ababa. In the 1960s she returned to the city and continued to write for piano, organ, and violin. Her first albums, Spielt Eigene Kompositionen and Der Sang des Meeres, were recorded in Germany in 1963 as charity releases benefitting liturgical students in the city of Gondar, where she had relocated. The fruitful run of music, which included timeless songs like “Homesickness” and “The Homeless Wanderer,” became some of her best-known.",Experimental,9.0
428,"On the latest album from his ambient alter ego, Baths’ Will Wiesenfeld uses fuzzed-out guitars and tape-warped textures to conjure a blissful sense of refuge. Will Wiesenfeld loves anime, manga, video games, cartoons—all media with the potential to open up a fantasy world. The Southern California producer often seems to see his music the same way, not least on his 2017 Baths album Romaplasm, a definitive combination of his taste for high fantasy and his gift for gripping romantic and erotic narratives. If that record was like one of the Ghibli or Pixar films Wiesenfeld holds dear to his heart, his releases under the more prolific Geotic name are like hardbound books of concept art, showing the landscapes he’s capable of conjuring before he populates them with his characters. His new Geotic album The Anchorite creates a small and pleasant patch of woods within this universe.An anchorite is a religious recluse, and accordingly, Wiesenfeld creates an atmosphere of sylvan solitude across these 12 tracks, keeping his vocals to a hushed and wordless murmur at the margins of the music. In the foreground is an omnipresent field of static, which Wiesenfeld uses not to obscure his music so much as to create a rugged and spiky texture; the crackles and pops reach out of the mix like the grasping branches in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Electronics are deployed sparingly, and what few drums Wiesenfeld uses tend to plod like thick workboots through mud. The primary instruments are electric guitar, treated with effects so it sounds a bit like Bibio’s, and piano, which Wiesenfeld sidechains on “The Wood of Corridors” so it seems as if it’s being consumed by an avalanche. It sounds a little bit like folk music, but not quite.The wood-hewn textures are the most striking thing about The Anchorite, but once it’s over, the melodies are what you’re most likely to remember. Wiesenfeld has a strong pop instinct, and “The Going” and “The Monastic Quiet” are plenty catchy. The music rarely strays far from major keys, and it never hints at much mystery or danger, instead preferring to inhabit a place of certainty and peace—the perspective of the anchorite, perhaps, who has spent a long time here and sees it as a place of refuge, not secrets. Those who like their ambient moodier might find it a tad saccharine, but those on the same wavelength of artists like the Album Leaf, Eluvium, Ulrich Schnauss or Adam Young’s Port Blue project will find more than enough to enjoy.The Anchorite is most intriguing when it takes us into the more overgrown thickets of Wiesenfeld’s mind. “The Injury” is a lovely backwards guitar sketch that suggests that if ML Buch ever makes a Suntub remix album, Wiesenfeld should be one of the first names she calls up. But even after all the different effects heard across the album, “The Lime of Stars” comes as a shock, erupting into a dense wall of overdrive halfway through, as if Wiesenfeld’s character has suddenly taken a wrong turn into the enchanted woodlands of the black-metal imagination. A few more moments like that might’ve helped The Anchorite feel more expansive, but even at 50 minutes, the album seems finite: a small patch of land with defined borders, sketched lovingly by Wiesenfeld in the margins of the ever-expanding map of his world.",Electronic,7.0
429,"The indie pop veterans’ sixth album fuses the laid-back sound of 1990s soft rock with pedal steel and countrypolitan filigree. It’s lean, clean—and a little sleepy. For Real Estate’s sixth album, the New Jersey jangle-pop quintet decamped to Nashville’s legendary RCA Studio A, the epicenter of country music’s post-war shift out of its rougher, twangier roots designed to accommodate large vocal and instrumental ensembles. For a band that’s slowly been broadening its sound, it’s an ideal venue. But as intriguing as the notion of “Martin Courtney goes countrypolitan” is, Real Estate’s relocation was less concerned with the musical possibilities than the symbolic ones. Studio A has made pop crossover dreams come true; so has producer Daniel Tashian, a Grammy winner for his work on Kacey Musgraves’ Golden Hour. Unlike Golden Hour, there’s no disco excursion on Daniel—they already pulled off that trick on 2020’s The Main Thing—but it’s the cleanest and leanest album they’ve ever made.As such, Daniel may seem like a sort of retreat. The Main Thing was intended to be Real Estate’s statement album, but as with so many pandemic-era projects, the lack of an accompanying tour made it an unfinished argument. Left to his own devices, Courtney recorded a solo project that tacked away from extended arrangements and jazzy sophistipop. Some of that was out of necessity (he tracked the bulk of the instrumentation on his own); some of it was the lower expectations for an album that wouldn’t be played live any time soon. And some of it was the pleasure of writing an indie-pop song like “Corncob,” which put pedal steel to a gorgeous melody that recalled the Shins at their most magisterial. Daniel carries that pleasure forward, pedal steel rig in tow.There’s an urgency to these songs, even at their lightest. On “Haunted World,” Real Estate snap from AM country gold into chiming choruses with the efficiency and feel of a crack studio group; guest musician Justin Schipper’s pedal steel curls around Matt Kallman’s soft-rock keyboard fills like cigar smoke. The ill-at-ease “Market Street” shuffles R.E.M. albums like playing cards—from a high-stepping, almost four-on-the-floor clip that would be at home on Green or Document, Julian Lynch draws a snarling guitar line out of “Ignoreland.” According to press materials, the band wrote Daniel with “’90s soft-rock radio” in mind, which presumably means adult alternative instead of, I don’t know, Richard Marx. “I hear a song there inside my head,” Courtney sings on the bright-eyed lead single “Water Underground.” “Can’t lose it yet, try to make it stay.” The chorus suggests that the song may be “There She Goes.”",Rock,6.9
430,"The Queens-born, Punjabi American rapper revels in the hyper-referential code-switching of his work in Das Racist and Swet Shop Boys while bringing newfound focus to his writing. The idea that Heems should need to prove his rap credentials to anyone is absurd. As one third of late-aughts/early-2010s alt-rap deconstructionists Das Racist, the Queens-born, Punjabi American rapper helped redefine hip-hop for the internet era, combining incisive, hyper-literate commentary on race, rap, and identity politics with irreverent jokes about smoking weed and George Costanza’s penis. After the group’s dissolution in 2012, he showed he could also be sincere and emotionally vulnerable, documenting the trauma of the post-9/11 years on 2015 solo album Eat Pray Thug. His last full-length—Swet Shop Boys’ 2016 album Cashmere—was a landmark of code-switching diaspora rap that bridged the gap between Queens, Hackney, and Delhi’s Chandni Chowk.But throughout his career, Heems has struggled with the labels—joke-rapper, hipster, the Indian guy—that have been forced onto him, fuelling the perception that this working-class Queens native who grew up on Nas and the Lost Boyz was somehow an outsider to hip-hop. “The worst rapper on this track, third coolest,” he rapped on Mr. Muthafuckin’ eXquire’s “The Last Huzzah!,” a sardonic riposte to haters that nonetheless hinted at a little insecurity. On the Lapgan-produced LAFANDAR, his first release in six years, a re-energized Heems sets out to finally put those doubts at rest. “I really wanted to make a real rappy-rap album,” he said in a recent interview. “So I could once and for all finish the ‘can he rap?’ conversation.”On that front, LAFANDAR delivers. This is the sharpest Heems has sounded in a minute, dishing out tongue-twisting quotables in rhyme after rhyme, all delivered with his signature nonchalant swagger. There’s a focus to his writing here that has eluded him on earlier solo outings. All the glorious messiness and anything-can-happen eclecticism of Das Racist and his early solo work on Nehru Jackets and Wild Water Kingdom is still present, but there’s precious little of the erratic non-sequiturs and self-indulgent irony that bogged down parts of Eat Pray Thug (he’s not repeating the word “clarity” like a broken record and passing it off as a bar anymore).“My dough nuts, ich bin ein Berliner,” he raps on “I’m Pretty Cool,” referencing Kennedy’s classic anti-Communist speech (and a classic German jelly donut) in service of a gleefully juvenile wisecrack that’s classic Das Racist. On “Kala Tika,” he takes the very Indian trait of mixing up our “v”s and “w”s and runs with it, effortlessly switching syllables to hilarious—and hypnotic—effect. There’s a sinister timbre to his voice on the coke-rap-adjacent South Asian posse cut “Going for 6” (featuring Sonnyjim and Abhi the Nomad) that oozes cartoonish menace, a version of Heems you wouldn’t want to run into on a dark street. The record’s diverse collaborators—ranging from Sir Michael Rocks and Cool Calm Pete to Saul Williams and Fatboi Sharif—all bring their A-game, and Heems is at his most inventive when trading bars with his fellow emcees. His chemistry with Your Old Droog is palpable on “Sri Lanka,” where he plays the wise-cracking smart aleck to Droog’s broody boom-bap drawl. Elsewhere, on “Obi Toppin,” he sounds thrilled at sharing a track with an early idol. “Yo check me out I got a song with Kool Keith,” he declares over a mangled soul sample, and you can’t help but smile at this charmingly guileless humblebrag.",Rap,7.2
431,"Alynda Segarra’s fantastic new album revives the folky textures of previous records to grapple with American myths and tragedies. It’s part folk-punk memoir, part spiritual invocation. In Juan Gómez Bárcena’s 2023 novel Not Even the Dead, a former conquistador accepts a mysterious quest from the colonial government of Mexico. He must leave his wife and home, but it’s going to be worth it—the job pays gold, and it should only take two weeks. Off he goes, riding horseback into numerous trials and tribulations, all the while reassuring himself: Two weeks. Two more weeks will do the trick. Two weeks is the least of his problems because he’s not only riding, he’s time traveling—advancing by decades and then centuries, tripping and stumbling into future worlds where the legends and prejudices of the past continually take on new shapes. Eventually he’s reincarnated as a migrant worker, hitching a ride on a train.“Time can take you for a ride,” Alynda Segarra sings near the top of their ninth album, The Past Is Still Alive. Rather than horses, Segarra mostly writes about trains, because they used to hop a few themself and because of the way the train, the first rhythm of rural industrialization, runs beneath the American blues and folk music that inform their career as Hurray for the Riff Raff. That’s the shaky-steady forward momentum driving The Past Is Still Alive: part folk-punk memoir, part harm-reduction PSA, part spiritual invocation and/or world-historical séance. The location is: Out there somewhere and the time is: Don’t you know all time is connected?The Past Is Still Alive represents a turn back toward more traditionally Americana textures after 2022’s Life on Earth, a kind of electronic rewilding project that followed the slicker, self-consciously conceptual The Navigator. The sound is dusky, naturalistic, one-third electric and two-thirds acoustic; we see softness and joy in the human experience and, lurking in the background, violence, fentanyl, and barrels of crude. Producer Brad Cook plays bass here, along with a core studio lineup including brother Phil Cook (piano, organ, Wurltizer, dobro) and drummer Yan Westerlund—what one might call the alternate-reality Megafaun, featuring two original member-brothers and the third member’s brother (behold, the ever-reaching influence of DeYarmond Edison).Elements from Segarra’s biography appear in flashes throughout their discography but rarely as explicitly as in The Past Is Still Alive, a vivid time travelogue that reflects on Segarra’s youthful misadventures as a “dirty kid” or punk traveler with humility, nostalgia, and transhistorical perspective. In the retelling, shoplifting and dumpster diving for food represent both self-sufficiency and secret shame. And when you have no place to go, a train will take you somewhere. It’s certainly not the lifestyle for everyone: “Here’s a silver spoon, you can eat your heart out as a prize,” Segarra taunts, or cautions, on highlight “Hawkmoon,” a rollicking coming-of-age story honoring a trans mentor, Miss Jonathan, who’s assaulted and never seen again.",Rock,8.3
432,"N/A Japan’s Ghost have always seemed more like an arcane religious sect than a traditional band. In the 1980s, they avoided traditional rock clubs, performing instead in fields, ruins, woods, caves, and temples. Since they sidled into Western consciousness via their self-titled debut album on Hideo Ikeezumi’s P.S.F. label in 1990, Ghost have built a discography rife with solemn psychedelia, opiated folk rock, and confounding improv.Newly reissued by Drag City, their first three albums—the self-titled debut LP, 1992’s Second Time Around, and the 1994 live document Temple Stone, all originally recorded for P.S.F.—capture the group at its purest and most mysterious, like a Japanese analogue of Popol Vuh. In a 2004 interview, lead singer/guitarist/banjoist Masaki Batoh observed that Ghost’s creativity stems from unknowable origins: “Music falls from highest sphere. We don't make music. It's born naturally.”Ghost was my gateway into the splendors of Japanese psychedelia. The image on the cover captures the enigmatic pastoral air permeating the album: Batoh—long-haired, rail-thin, and behatted— and the rest of the band pose on a grassy, mist-shrouded hill before massive speakers, ancient sculptures, or perhaps both. Opening track “Sun Is Tangging” begins with a triangle tap and shaken shells before a horrifying scream and rumbling drums puncture the calm. This enlightening kick in the ear eventually gives way to a languid folkadelic sway, with Batoh cooing inscrutable lyrics (“Sea Mous melt and sleep/While my evil eye’s closed/Think about your rough land/All the bitch and milk snow, pun is dry”). His cyclical acoustic guitar riff, Noriaki Hagiya’s mournful oboe, and Mu Krsna’s conga slaps cohere into a hypnotic fantasia. Batoh proves an inelegant crooner who often sounds tipsy, his accented English hard to decipher, but that only adds to Ghost’s charm.Ghost’s salubrious infatuation with Can surfaces in “Guru in the Echo,” whose chunky, Jaki Liebezeit-esque tom-tom tattoos lead into a grandiloquent strain of garage rock bearing traces of the Hombres’ “Let It Out (Let It All Hang Out).” Hearing Ghost bust out of their dominant restrained mode is exhilarating. The three songs bearing “Moungod” in their titles carry a whiff of ominous ritual—replete with monk-ish chants and rickety hand percussion—and reveal Ghost’s kinship with nomadic improv ensemble Taj-Mahal Travellers.But the real meat of Ghost resides in the ballads—which distinguished the band from most of their P.S.F. comrades, who favored overwhelmingly distorted power chords and swift tempos. The wispy “I’ve Been Flying,” a song of gentle escapism, floats on Batoh’s acoustic guitar and featherlight vocals reminiscent of Nick Drake. One of Ghost’s most moving and inventive songs, “Ballad of Summer Rounder” balances between elegance and shambles until the drums and bass propel the piece into a defiant work of empowerment. After a poignant, fragile flute solo by Taishi Takizawa, the track morphs into a chaotic, Faust-ian rock entanglement. On the lacily beautiful “Rakshu,” the mood is gloriously devotional; Hagiya’s valedictory oboe part sends the listener to the exit feeling shaken to the core.",Folk,8.0
433,"The breakout rapper’s dystopian sci-fi concept album is full of glitzy soundscapes, rapidly morphing tempos, and naked cyborgian wails. Don’t mistake interstellar style for substance. One time at the meeting of the minds, aka backstage at Lyrical Lemonade Summer Smash, Yeat was asked by YouTube personality and guerilla reporter Andrew Callaghan what he would do with a time machine. His answer: Travel “six million years” into the future where there would be “spaceships” and “alien lean.” Pretty vague, but hey, no one is asking him to be Frank Herbert. If you’ve been following the formation of the Portland rapper’s devout cult over the last few years—from underground viral sensation with 2021’s pyrotechnic 4L to boxing out Drake on 2023’s For All the Dogs—then his ramblings about outer space and UFOs are nothing new. I never thought all that deeply about his obsession with futuristic imagery, though—I just figured that he’s frequently smacked and doesn’t have much else to talk about. So it’s a little surprising to see it becoming his thing. On his latest album, 2093—not quite six million years but far enough—he’s on top of a foggy city roof in a black leather duster straight out of Blade Runner, making galactic-scale music calibrated for interstellar communication. Welcome to Yeat’s vision of the future.Too bad it’s not that interesting or original of a vision. The glitzy soundscapes, rapidly morphing tempos, and naked cyborgian wails, not to mention the audible generosity of the budget, make 2093 feel like a lightweight Travis Scott record. An underwhelming pivot, considering that these days one Travis is boring enough. Don’t believe me? You can hear the heavy (heavy) inspiration in “Power Trip,” especially in how his distant lilts and the gaudy beat combine for an effect as impersonal as contacting an airline chatbot. “U Should Know” is basically a UTOPIA demo, only worth it for the celestial extravagance of the instrumental. Even the glacial close-encounters ballad “1093” just seems like a Vultures 2 audition. Sure, the beats are flashy and very polished, but Yeat’s eccentricities as a rapper are flattened by the scope. He sounds less funny, less improvisational, less weird.There’s still some fun to be had. (I would hope so at 22 tracks—or 28, if you include P2 and P3, add-ons designed to game his way to a No. 1 album.) For as showy and combustible as Yeat’s sound can be, it’s the small details that really hook you. All it takes is one silly bar or far-out melodic burst and suddenly you’re sending that one song to everyone in your contacts. 2093 has some of those moments: On “Tell më,” when he croons, “It’s easier to scream, I’ll send ya straight to hell,” and hits the final “hell” with a warped effect that makes his voice sound like it’s shattering. Or when the whirrs and bleeps of “Familia” dim for a second so he can evocatively spit, “I’m pissin’ on this beat, it’s like a bathroom stall.” One of the concepts on “Bought the Earth” is pretty funny: He gets so rich that he literally buys the planet, only to immediately sell it. He should be the CEO of a media corporation.",Rap,5.8
434,"Embracing the Y2K R&B of her youth, Erika de Casier molds the silvery avant-gardism of artists like Aaliyah and Janet Jackson into an ultra-stylish throwback for the era of ASMR. The best era of pop music is the one that you grew up with—a truism that feels like fact if, like Erika de Casier and this writer, music television was your oxygen in the year 2000. Recently the conveyor belt of retromania has returned the sparkly, silvery aesthetic of Aaliyah, TLC, and Jennifer Lopez to relevancy, but Y2K revivalism finds its most meticulous acolyte in de Casier, whose third album is a faithful evocation of a very specific moment in Black American music—a time when pop domination and electronic avant-gardism were two sides of the same coin.On her previous albums, the Copenhagen singer and producer combed through ’90s and ’00s UK garage and glimmers of IDM as well as the strain of juddering future-R&B separatism led by Timbaland, Missy Elliott, and Aaliyah. The turn-of-the-millennium styling of 2021’s Sensational elevated de Casier to critical darling, but her biggest commercial success has come through collaboration with the K-pop outfit NewJeans, translating Jersey club bounce into two stratospheric singles, “Super Shy” and “Cool With You.”On Still—the title references both J.Lo and Dr. Dre—de Casier narrows her focus, sticking mostly to a palette of sweet, head-register vocals in the lineage of Janet, Mýa, and Ashanti; plucked strings and stuttering rhythms à la Darkchild and Timbaland; and an air of restraint that feels purposely adult, as outlined by Sade and Maxwell. The Proustian madeleine tastes good. Slippery, sensual “ooh” is a testament to Aaliyah and Tim’s greatest hits, a jerking boudoir grind that throws in a line from Ice Cube and Ms. Toi’s raunch anthem “You Can Do It.” There are fourth-wall-breaking ad-libs straight from the postmodern ’90s—some of them in Danish—like the “Stop!” that brings “Ice” to a halt. On that track, which grounds the album’s flawlessly catchy middle third, de Casier brings in Tampa rap duo They Hate Change for a sweet-and-sour duet like they used to do ’em—accusations are thrown, someone’s “on freezer mode” and Copenhagen’s giving the boys “frosty soles.”The rise of Aaliyah in the middle of the ’90s called time on the big-haired belters of the previous generation and ushered in an intimate, heady style that remains the blueprint for countless young singers, including today’s close-mic stylists Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo. De Casier pushes this technique to fascinating extremes, her vocals set so far back in the mix they’re practically in reverse. Her performance on “The Princess,” a feminist reckoning with desire (“Is it wrong of me to want all the things I was shown all my life?”), is like sandpaper meeting velvet, showcasing her absolute control on a minute, ASMR-like scale.",Pop,7.4
435,"Pairing multilingual processed vocals with shape-shifting electroacoustic arrangements, the Italo-Congolese singer and composer explores the limits of the unconscious. Laryssa Kim—an Italo-Congolese singer, composer, dancer, performance artist, and student of acousmatics—melds musique concrète and processed vocals into otherworldly, polymorphous compositions that abandon typical song structures. The title of Oneironauts, a 2020 performance, speaks to the Brussels-based musician’s wandering ethos: she traverses dream states to draw out the strange beauty lurking beneath our everyday consciousness. On her debut album, Contezza (which in Italian means “awareness”), she casts a trance-inducing spell with atmospheric electroacoustic arrangements and vocals in English, Italian, and French. It’s her most accomplished work yet, a mesmerizing odyssey guided by sharp intention.Kim takes her time across Contezza, slowly unfurling field recordings, stretches of eerie ambient tones, and her own tender vocalizations. The continuous mix, threaded together with rushing waves and rolling thunder, deepens the contemplative intensity, as though Kim were moving through nature and transforming what she sees into sweeping, fragmented sounds of her own. The opening “Les Amants d’Osmium - 76 OS” and “Tum Tum - Cuori in Tumulto” stitch together drones, birdsong, and an insistent digital patter that resembles a thumping heartbeat, welcoming listeners into Kim’s unsettlingly beautiful world. Synth tones pierce “Scegli Me - Contesa,” where a haunting chorus of Kim’s looped humming levitates like an encroaching fog. “Scegli me/Portami con te/Portami nel sogno,” (“Choose me/Bring me with you/Take me into the dream”) she sings, establishing the album’s hypnagogic tone with her lullaby-like intonation.Contezza dovetails with Kim’s inspirations in intriguing ways. Her early work drew on reggae riddims, informed by a childhood love of Bob Marley; on the French-language track “L’attente - Auspicio,” a throbbing bassline forms a taut beat behind her echoing vocals, yielding a seductive, bare-bones trip-hop track. On “Obsession - Indomita Mente,” another standout, a metronomic click and dramatic synth sweeps set the stage for Kim’s lovelorn lyrics: “Can’t take the thought of you anymore/It’s like a chain,” she sings softly, tempering the bittersweet kiss-off: “Keep on fighting it… But now I know/I know/I’ll let you go.” She warps the final line into a contorted, held note that slips into a clattering beat, painting a surprisingly broad emotional arc in under five minutes.The abstract interludes that punctuate Contezza lend to its hypnotic qualities. The synths that crinkle in on themselves on “Intimacy - Reserbo” lead into a gorgeous chorus and spoken-word outro flecked with birdsong, while “Voeu - Canto Votivo” dabbles with even more extreme vocal manipulation, distorting Kim’s voice into an oscillating, vibrantly reedy instrument. Like much of Contezza, it’s cerebral but never insular—throughout, Kim balances her esoteric impulses with a radiant warmth. On “Ma Chi Sei - Ascoso,” a tenderhearted ballad toward the end of the album, Kim reaches for answers to existential questions posed both to herself and listeners: “Cosa senti?/Cosa pensi?/Cosa vuoi?/Chi sei?” she asks, the melody dancing along a tightrope (“What do you hear?/What do you think?/What do you want?/Who are you?”). Then the song dissolves into a percussive, uplifting beat; a sense of optimism emerges from the uncertainty, driving home Contezza’s belief in liberation from limitation.",Electronic,7.8
436,"After many years spent experimenting with arcane, home-built electronic devices, the Portuguese musician returns to his guitar for a gorgeous ambient suite informed by drone music and vintage jazz. Rafael Toral has returned to Earth. The jet plane on the cover of his 1994 debut, Sound Mind Sound Body, signaled his skyward trajectory, and he spent the rest of the decade surfing on clouds of guitar. Each new release dissolved a bit more of Brian Eno’s long ambient tones into My Bloody Valentine’s rapturous haze until Toral’s sound faded into the stratosphere. Toral knew he had escaped gravity: The last sound on 2001’s Violence of Discovery and Calm of Acceptance was grainy background noise from a Space Shuttle webcast. He had gone as high as the guitar could take him.To survive out there untethered to his instrument, Toral founded his own Space Program, a rigorous 13-year project that required inventing his own devices: glove-controlled sine-wave generator, light-controlled portable amplifier, electrode-controlled oscillator. He wanted to combine jazz with electronic music without borrowing from either tradition—as he put it, “making music from scratch.” Daunted by his own ambition, Toral felt his way through this concept like he was navigating a cathedral blindfolded. He didn’t initially perform his new music in public for fear of baffling his audiences, he said, since “it was impossible to demonstrate that each [instrument] is like the tip of one among many networked icebergs.” Still, he worked with enviable discipline, performing Space Solos and in Space Quartets and Space Collectives, honing his craft across a growing constellation of releases until his audience understood the scale of the enterprise.The Space Program ended in 2017 when Toral decided to combine his ambient guitar work with the improvisational tactics he had developed with his own instruments. Spectral Evolution is the result. Toral’s machines chirp, croon, and howl over a base of shifting guitar hum, responding to one another like extraterrestrial species. The whole 12-part suite unfurls like a gorgeous symphony, as if the entire Space Program only served as preparation for translating a work of cosmic complexity into a language we humans could understand.The album is a chiasmus, the second half mirroring the first. Fold it down the middle and each section meets its counterpart: “Changes” and “Changes Reprise,” “Descending” and “Ascending,” “First Short Space” and “Second Short Space.” This structure develops organically across the record’s 47 minutes, as song-like forms emerge from, and dissolve into, ambient lulls. The “First Long Space” is a slow drift that would fit squarely into Toral’s 1990s discography if it weren’t for the electronics soloing over top. From this harmonic bed arises the crescendo of centerpiece “Fifths Twice,” which again makes way for electronic devices to flutter and buzz over the “Second Long Space.” Tides of guitar are pulled across the record again and again by the retreating celestial bodies of Space Program instruments.",Electronic,8.0
437,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit the great jazz saxophonist Ornette Coleman’s 1972 opus, a one-of-a-kind dispatch from the vibrant, polygenic, and contested lofts of downtown New York. A decade after he arrived in New York and reshaped jazz to come, Ornette Coleman purchased a co-op. He wasn’t searching for valuable real estate when he bought two stories of a former factory on Prince Street, in the bloodless heart of the then-barren post-industrial neighborhood known as SoHo. It was 1968, and the saxophonist, who laid the foundation for free jazz, wanted a place where he could compose, sleep, shoot pool, and host friends’ concerts. His 10,000-square-foot residence on the third floor was sparsely furnished, in true downtown bohemian fashion, with an inflatable raft he used as his couch and a myna bird who greeted guests. On the ground level was a concert and practice space he called “Artists House,” which he lent to fellow musicians nearly for free. Just a few years later, in the 1970s, jazz players galore began moonlighting apartments, storefronts, galleries, and warehouses as live venues, birthing the genre’s legendary loft scene. Artists House presaged this generous ethos and its paper-thin walls between home and work. A 1972 album Coleman made while living at his urban perch anticipated the movement’s aesthetic: Science Fiction’s style-agnostic, Afrofuturist vision thrums with city life, logging an unusual moment in time that rippled far into the future.The native Texan had already indelibly influenced the loft generation with his mythic run between 1959 and 1962 on Atlantic, during which he all but rewrote the language of his medium. Coleman abandoned fixed tonal centers and scaffolded the chromatic scale with quarter tones, sometimes while playing a plastic, flamboyantly white alto. He flouted the expected but based his originality in a wide range of musical traditions. Coleman’s upbringing in Fort Worth, where he was born in 1930 and grew up in a series of tiny, rented shotgun shacks, inundated him with big bands, bebop, and a kind of expanded American songbook—spirituals, ragtime, blues, R&B, Tejano, Western swing—that either predated jazz or molded it into a regional vernacular. When he was 14 his mother gave him his first horn, which soon became a way of making cash. As Maria Golia discusses in her terrific biography Ornette Coleman: The Territory and the Adventure, he gigged around his hometown’s vibrant scene during the late 1940s, helping out in a single-parent household. Coleman’s father had died when he was 7. His sister found him work as a musician in clubs that catered to varied clientele yet remained starkly segregated.Coleman hated most of these performances, which felt racially and creatively conservative, although he went along with whatever she rustled up. He rebelled on other stages; his high school band booted him for improvising during a traditional Sousa march. In 1948, while soloing at an all-white joint, he had a revelation: What if he left the melody behind entirely on “Stardust,” pulling instead from the bounty of other notes he heard in the chord changes—wouldn’t that make a tired standard less boring? The dancers who led the crowd in their revelry froze, confused by his improvisations, and the club owner fired him. Soon after, Coleman taught another player bebop while he traveled the South with a variety tent show, performing for audiences who were more accustomed to ragtime and Dixieland than the compositional modernism in vogue among New York’s edgier audiences. He was ejected from the bandstand and left penniless in Natchez, Mississippi, where cops harassed and chased him out of town. Downriver in Baton Rouge, belligerent locals beat him up and smashed his instrument beyond repair. They found the 18 year old’s long hair offensive, and his strange sax styling—a preview of how he soon outgrew bebop’s complex harmonies in favor of the more open-ended and dissonant music that the world deemed “free jazz”—freaked them out, too.",Jazz,9.5
438,"On her fifth solo album, the Stereolab principal highlights the contradictions at the heart of her music, pairing deceptively sweet arrangements with unsparing socio-political critique. Laetitia Sadier is a master of deceptive sweetness, smuggling unflinching politics into an indie-rock landscape not known for its ethical fortitude. In Stereolab she wrapped lyrics about war, capitalist collapse, and fascism into soaringly groovy pop songs, while Little Tornados, her group with filmmaker David Thayer, tackled exploitative economic systems over honeyed guitar licks. Her juxtapositions have never sounded more jarring—or uncomfortable—than they do on Rooting for Love, Sadier’s fifth solo album and first since Stereolab reunited in 2019.“Don’t Forget You’re Mine” exemplifies the record’s subversive audacity. It is, ostensibly, a gentle pop song; its dulcet melody, bright chord changes, and lush strings are reminiscent of the lounge music and ’60s pop that were among Stereolab’s myriad influences. But the lyrics—written by Véronique Vincent, of veteran Belgian experimentalists Aksak Maboul—paint a sickening portrait of femicide, leading to the stomach-churning line “A good slap is what you need/A good slap is what you want/Take that, take that/Get up, get up, babe.” The contrast between musical mood, lyrical darkness, and Sadier’s almost standoffish tone—a model of cool, melodic mystery—is genuinely unsettling, a reminder of the singer’s long history as a politically charged disruptive force in modern music.This isn’t the only moment that recalls Sadier’s storied past. Stereolab covered so much ground over their two-decade recording career—try to name a genre that the band didn’t dabble in—and Sadier, as the band’s singer, songwriter, lyricist, and co-founder, was so integral to their sound that trying to move her solo work from under Stereolab’s shadow feels like an awkward parlor game. Perhaps realizing this, Sadier leans into her history on Rooting for Love: The album’s palette of humming synths, wandering bass, gentle vibraphone clatter, and intricate backing vocals suggest Stereolab with the guitars turned down.“Panser L’inacceptable” hints at the space-age Gallic pop of Mars Audiac Quintet; “La Nageuse Nue” reflects the jazz-influenced dreaminess of Dots and Loops, and “Une Autre Attente” assimilates Margerine Eclipse’s wounded drive. Straying further afield, “Who + What” has a modish trip-hop beat not atypical of Stereolab, exactly, but not quintessential either, while “The Inner Smile” rides out on a thrilling flute freak that suggests (very) early Kraftwerk, rather than Stereolab’s more typical kosmische influences Neu! and Can.The songwriting is distinguished by its bite and brevity. “New Moon” boasts a chorus as sharp as biting down on a lemon, while the gorgeous about-faces of the shifting chord changes of “Une Autre Attente” suggest the twists and turns of a classic Hitchcock film morphed into a perfect pop package.",Experimental,7.5
439,"After a 2018 album hailed as a return to form, the duo shifts to slick, big-tent pop pastiche—Britpop, power ballads, ’80s excess—delivered with arched brows and palpable yearning. At some point in the last decade or so, public opinion, among those who still give thought to MGMT, began quietly shifting to accommodate the notion that they are a much stranger band than their career might initially have suggested. More than just one-album wonders who never recaptured the magic of their indelible early hits, or even misunderstood tinkerers who found the spotlight in a fluke accident and quickly retreated—though both descriptions are true enough—they are artists whose work addresses the very sort of glitzy mass appeal that those early hits still command. Even “Time to Pretend,” one of the singles that earned them slots opening for Paul McCartney and soundtracking the season finale of Gossip Girl, was itself a grimly funny satire of rock stardom. After two resolutely uncommercial follow-ups, one of which has since been reclaimed as a cult classic, 2018’s synth-poppy Little Dark Age was hailed in some corners as a return to form, a dubious honor that doesn’t quite cover that album’s own idiosyncrasies. Loss of Life is unlikely to face the same sort of mistaken identity.MGMT’s fifth album, and first for the indie label Mom+Pop after an improbably long run on Columbia, shows no signs of a tightened budget. Nor does it scan as another retreat from whatever renewed attention Little Dark Age attracted. The production is slick as can be, and the songs aren’t shy about reaching for the rafters. But this time the big-tent sounds that Ben Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyngarden are refracting and subverting seem calibrated in part to challenge our notions of good taste: Britpop at its most bloated and bombastic, boy-band slow jams, songs that might have soundtracked the big kiss in a 1980s action-romance flick, or those that a formerly folky songwriter of the 1970s might have recorded while struggling to navigate the era of gated reverb and fretless bass. One track, the Christine and the Queens collaboration “Dancing in Babylon,” carries the unmistakable whiff of Savage Garden. Sometimes, they play these various highly specific idioms relatively straight. More often, they warp them like funhouse mirror images: the edges are still clean and precise, but the shapes they outline are all wrong.Resurrecting old schlock in queasy new definition is not a novel pursuit in 2024. Loss of Life distinguishes itself through its use of this soft-rock accelerationist aesthetic to bolster the thematic punch of Goldwasser and VanWyngarden’s songs, which come across as equally awed and aghast at our era’s technological splendor and the crushing dehumanization it inflicts upon all but the most fortunate. Their palette of references serves a dual function: The arrangements’ gaudy spectacle reflects the feeling of life in a wonderland of convenience, entertainment, and alienation, even as their palpable sense of yearning earnestly suggests the possibility that love could help us to transcend this well-appointed hell we’ve made. At its best, this unification of sounds and ideas also serves to heighten the experience of these songs as songs, not only on the intellectual plane, but also in that more mysterious place, closer to our hearts, where we take stock of pop music’s innumerable variables, then subject their product, through a chain of involuntary and intuitive reactions, to one more-or-less binary judgment: Is it hitting or not?",Rock,6.9
440,"Guided by her spellbinding whistling, the Los Angeles musician’s debut album is as sumptuous and wistful as a vintage film score. Some things are best left unsaid. But for Molly Lewis, they might be better whistled. In her wonderfully quirky world, lyrics are omitted and replaced with high-pitched chirps and trills. Across her debut album On the Lips, Lewis invites you to sit back and relax in her so-called Café Molly universe, where the music is as glittering and enticing as the romantic world it conjures up.Lewis’ idiosyncratic gift makes it easy to picture her as the lounge act hidden in a Guillermo del Toro film or at the Roadhouse in Twin Peaks. She knows how weird her career path is, dialing up the humor in the opening track: “Good evening,” she whispers. “Tonight I’ll be”—pause for dramatic effect—“whistling.”Once you get past the initial eccentricity, Lewis’ whistling eventually becomes so familiar and immersive that her vocalizations feel as mundane as the soft crooning of a jazz singer. Song after song, her abilities are astounding—how she quivers the final note of “Cocosette” or sustains such a clear and steady tone on “Slinky” is impressive, even after multiple listens. She maintains your attention with wistful production flourishes, courtesy of her backing band. That might be a brief saxophone solo on the swaying “Lounge Lizard,” a distant choir on the tragic, Nancy Sinatra-like “Crushed Velvet,” or the gentle plinks of a piano on “Moon Tan.”On the Lips is the kind of inviting ambient record that neither distracts entirely nor melts into monotony. Take “Slinky”: The opening synths and steady percussion resemble underwater submersion, but Lewis’ whistling persuades you to come up for air, beckoning you to her like a siren. Rather than dissolving into tedium, Lewis molds the accompanying background melodies to enhance and be enhanced by her vocalizations, a balance that makes On the Lips a singular joy.Lewis’ cover of Jeanette’s 1974 track “Porqué Te Vas” keeps the same funkiness as the original, but she adapts it to her own loungey sound. It might be one of the more compelling tracks on On the Lips; driven by the slightly faster tempo, Lewis playfully chases after the track’s rolling guitars and percussion. On the Lips delights in taking things slow. Her songs feel romantic, full of longing—a fact only amplified by the listening instructions she offers in the album insert, which recommend ambient lighting and being dressed in ornate silk fabric.The charming “Sonny”—which is dedicated to Kenneth “Sonny” Donato, former MC for Lewis’ Café Molly show series and Charles Bukowski associate—contains the same fantastical, expanding wonder as an Alexandre Desplat score and the vintage nostalgia of Jon Brion. Lewis’ music feels this way for a reason; she referred to her work as “soundtracks” back in 2021 and has been featured across film and TV, including last year’s Barbie. On the Lips succeeds as an introduction to her mystifying world: Its whimsicality leaves you spellbound, hoping to hear just one more faint whistle even after the final track fades out.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

441,"The New York duo’s gloomy trip rock songs are danceable, depressing, and designed for you to mosh with your shadows. New York winters are best soundtracked by brutal reverb or ice-cold synths. Model/Actriz and Nation of Language, two beloved newcomers out of the Brooklyn indie scene, have mastered this particular chill on either side of the spectrum. Somewhere in the middle lies Amiture, a duo made up of Jack Whitescarver and Coco Goupil. This latest group out of New York’s new school of rock convey an earnest isolation by way of screeching guitars and quick-paced drum machines, a desire to dance in the dark alone.While their debut The Beach was comparatively synth-heavy, their follow-up Mother Engine feels dark as an oil slick—and just as coarse. The grooves here feel slightly askew, oscillating between the danceable and utterly depressing. Whitescarver sings with ferocity throughout, his tremulous voice soaring with rock’n’roll smolder, though at times it borders on inaudible growling. Still, cuts like fuzzed-out single “Billy’s Dream” unfortunately reduce him to a low grumble lost in a sea of drums and reverb.But these vocal modulations have the potential to touch the heart. Over looping guitar and cold, sparse percussion, “Dirty” tells a tale of queer yearning for an old flame now masquerading as straight. “You’re just like me/You wanna be a lady/You wanna make it dirty,” Whitescarver whispers to his former beau, evoking a pain all too familiar to any horny loverqueer spurned. On “Baby,” Whitescarver’s breathy snarl glides over upbeat drums. A particularly chilling cut comes in the form of “Cocaine”: Opening the doleful final third of the record, the namesake drug serves as a metaphor for Whitescarver’s toxic lover, a relationship he compares to being “just like [his] father” in a hushed rasp. This is a trip-hop scorcher for love addicts with daddy issues.Halfway through, Mother Engine begins to sputter. “HWL” feels like a Garbage B-side better left off the album, carried only by Whitescarver’s floaty voice. The song positions him as the latest in a long line of alt-rock frontmen whose lyrics can hardly be made out past the vocal dramatics. Near the end, the instrumental “Porte Sosie” proves that the band need not rely on the ghostly beauty of the lead singer’s pipes. Layered electric guitar riffs clash in a chaotic miasma, reviving a record that at this point feels like post-punk slosh. Moments like these are proof of this album’s crackling, compelling soul.Leonard Cohen famously said cracks allow light to enter, but the fissures in Whitescarver and Goupil’s music allow plenty of space to mosh with your shadows. Mother Engine is a sexy gallowdance, a trip rock journey that contains echoes of early 2000s New York, when Karen O and Julian Casablancas were rubbing shoulders with Paul Banks and James Murphy. It’s a chilling dream in a leather jacket, a one-night stand taken home from Welcome to the Johnsons that disappears in a thrush of guitar, in a wisp of smoke.",Rock,7.2
442,"Inspired by waltz time, heartbreak, and ambient Americana, Jason Lytle returns with his characteristic mix of humor and tragedy. Jason Lytle has always written in the folk tradition. Even in his early songs as Grandaddy, the Californian tended towards fictionalized narratives, aphoristically making sense of technological apprehension like a Pete Seeger or Judy Collins for the turn of the millennium. Rather than lament the uniform “little boxes” of post-war suburbia, Lytle channeled the alienation born from even smaller boxes—computer monitors, cubicles—into evergreen ennui. By casting his emotions onto our surroundings, both organic and non, Lytle rendered them universal in their profound specificity: “Grieve like a freeway tree,” he sang on the 2017’s Last Place, capturing a sadness so uniquely American and yet so instantly legible. On Blu Wav, Grandaddy’s first album in seven years, Lytle leans into bittersweet Americana twang, a natural fit for his fatally flawed, cautiously optimistic cast of characters.Inspiration for the shift toward country arrived when Lytle heard singer Patti Page’s 1950 hit “Tennessee Waltz” on his car radio. Struck by both the song’s time signature—he felt that he already naturally wrote in a waltz’s 3/4 or 6/8—and its gentle, winsome strings, he set out to make an album in a similar style. He captured his aesthetic vision in the titular phrase, a portmanteau of bluegrass and new wave—and since it wouldn’t be a proper Grandaddy title without at least one double meaning, “wav” also refers to the lossless audio format.In part, Blu Wav recalls what some writers have dubbed “cosmic country” (or if you want to sound really smug, “bootgaze”), wherein acts such as SUSS and Luke Schneider combine traditional folk instruments like lap steel guitar with modular synthesizers and drum machines. With the addition of Max Hart’s pedal steel, Blu Wav sounds as expansive as the open road: “Cabin in My Mind” layers flurries of arpeggiated synths and soft guitar atop Hart’s winding melodies, a warm invitation to Lytle’s imagined oasis. On “Long as I’m Not the One,” Hart’s pedal steel and a few well-placed bass plucks imagine Grandaddy as the Emo Morricone, singing about loneliness over swelling synths that conjure an endless Western expanse. His instrumentals—“Let’s Put This Pinto on the Moon” and “Yeehaw AI in the Year 2025”—take a far more impressionistic approach, recalling David Bowie’s Berlin Trilogy ambient work with Brian Eno. Between gurgling machine bleeps, sounds from Lytle’s home recording setup bleed into the mix—coyote howls, wind batting the walls—forming a cinematic combination of quotidian life with the alien sounds of synthesis. It isn’t quite familiar, but it’s not exactly frightening either: Blu Wav lives in the eerie in-between.",Rock,8.0
443,"With throwback beats and baroque pop embellishments, J. Lo’s first solo album in 10 years chronicles a real-life fairy tale that threatens to overpower the music. Did you hear about the two Hollywood megastars who got engaged, broke up in the shadow of a notorious workplace accident, and then, 20 years and several partners later, finally got hitched? If you somehow missed it, Jennifer Lopez is going to tell you in detail. This Is Me…Now, her first solo album in 10 years, is a coda to 2002’s This Is Me…Then, her third most commercially successful album. Lopez co-wrote and released that record amid the first iteration of her high-profile relationship with handsome Bostonian Ben Affleck. This Is Me…Now is the culmination of Bennifer, the sequel, irresistible to tabloids and hopeless romantics, maybe in that order. “When I was a girl they’d ask me what I’d be/A woman in love is what I grew up wantin’ to be,” Lopez sings, rather depressingly, on the title track.The album, and its accompanying $20 million movie, unfolds like one of J.Lo’s romcoms: Two former lovers, adrift, spend years searching for the right person, before reuniting with the wisdom of age and experience. The movie loosely follows the Taíno legend of Alida, the daughter of a Taíno chief who falls in forbidden love with Taroo, a Carib boy, on the eve of her arranged marriage; the god Yukiyú turns them into a red flower and a hummingbird, respectively. (The light pop joint “Hummingbird” bisects the album, though it doesn’t quite engage the mythology enough to be readily meaningful.) J.Lo is lovestruck as fuck, this album posits, though it is self-aware about its melodrama. “Mad in Love,” a mid-tempo R&B track, opens with a flute and string section out of a 1950s romance, nodding to This Is Me…Now’s Hollywood love story. Otherworldly harps, celestas, and violins weave through beats and production of a mid-2000s vintage, supplying a baroque quality that embellishes J.Lo’s own lovelorn legend.Across eight previous studio albums, a cache of hits like 2001’s “I’m Real” and 2011’s “On the Floor,” a Super Bowl performance and a presidential inauguration, J.Lo’s voice is notoriously serviceable, airy and light with a very specific range. A major appeal of her pop stardom is that the one-time Fly Girl is consistently dazzling on the dancefloor and, at 54, she appears athletic, taut, cool as ever. She’s advanced her music career through will and sheer charisma, of which she has gobs—we’re talking about a woman who had many of us out here wearing newsboy caps and cargo knickers in the early ’00s. She is an all-around entertainer, a fashion icon, and an often-great actor to boot. (Most will cite Hustlers, Selena, and Out of Sight; I’ll agree with J.Lo that she deserved an Oscar nod for El Cantante.) And so the thinness of the voice has often been beside the point, if not a boon to her early career—a stand-in for her Bronx regularness on tracks like “Jenny From the Block.”",Pop,6.6
444,"Two tree planters ventured into the forest and emerged as a folk-pop duo. Inspired by ’70s radio and Jungian philosophy, their new album is a breezy meditation on spirit and belonging. Loving’s origin story sounds like a myth, or a joke—Jesse Henderson and David Parry walk into the woods separately (as tree planters in Western Canada) and a little while later, a folk-pop brotherhood emerges from the forest. Inspired by voice memos, poems, and James Hollis’ Jungian treatise The Eden Project: In Search of the Magical Other, the songs on Any Light are breezy, mystical meditations on spirit and belonging—love songs that look inward, upward, and skyward in their pursuit of existential answers.One part George Harrison and one part Kings of Convenience, Any Light is all looping acoustic guitar and plinking keys, an endless journey guided by warm melodies. “Medicine” is a less jocular take on Harry Nilsson’s “Everybody’s Talkin.’” “On My Way to Loving You” amplifies face-pressed-to-the-window wistfulness with Hammond organ. “When I first met you,/Time was measured/By the moon on your body,” Henderson sings on “Blue,” slide guitar wailing plaintively in the background. “No Mast” is as sweet as a candy heart, an ode to the illusion of permanence in love built on ’70s radio chord progressions and tambourine shaking like a fluttering pulse.Often, the “you” in the album’s lyrics gestures at an unseen other, some entity that would offer completion or absolution, whether that’s a god or a lover. In “On My Way to You,” Henderson describes “following in your footsteps…/Trying just to be/Like a melody/You sing,” before stepping outside of love to watch it flow “like a river follows the landscape.” “Medicine,” loosely based on a friend’s experience with psychedelics, turns almost completely allegorical, its protagonist announcing a few seconds into the song: “I don’t want something already made,/I want to be the image not on display,/I want to be set free.” The song is just charming and self-aware enough to skirt the “hey man” variety of mushroom-induced revelation, but elsewhere, the musings are more grounded, easier to take seriously. The titular opening track is a tone-setting highlight that guides us like Virgil through this peripatetic folk journey. “I’ve been waiting so long,” Henderson sings in wonderment. “How I had it all wrong./Never have I seen you,/With open eyes,/With any light.” There’s that platitude about missing the forest for the trees, but Loving toggle between a bird’s-eye remove and an intimate closeness, from high above a river to a shaft of moonlight falling on a sleeping form.Sonically, this balance sometimes lacks. There are few extremes; the record is one meandering slog through a wintry landscape, pleasant and Quaaluudy to the point of occasional somnambulance. Songs like “Gift” barely register, especially relative to the bright punch of “Any Light” or “Uncanny Valley.” “Ask Directions” begs for a build, a moment of heightened stakes, but languishes instead in contemplative lethargy.In the Jungian interpretation, myths are part of our collective unconsciousness, both the thoughts we have and the way we think them. Rife with dream imagery, Any Light interrogates the gulf between the promise of love and its reality, the stories we tell ourselves about divinity and the way it humbles us the closer we get. Men journey into the woods for plenty of reasons, from self-discovery to solitude. When they’re lucky, they come out with a musical other, if not a magical one.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

445,"The disco-funk duo’s grown and sexy album sounds like a glossy recreation of an established style—minus some of the idiosyncrasy and fun. Late-stage capitalism has many downsides, but hearing about them from Chromeo is a new one. On Adult Contemporary, billed as a grown-up survey of “what it means to be funky in your 30s and 40s,” David “Dave 1” Macklovitch and Patrick “P-Thugg” Gemayel offer mea culpas for situationship snafus, pine for the ex who could change their ways, and, on the Italo-inspired disco of “BTS,” lament the libido-sapping ills of burnout culture. “I need to confess,” Dave 1 concludes, “Sometimes rest can be better than sex.” He’s got a point, but coming from bloghouse’s class clowns it’s kind of a bummer.On their albums Fancy Footwork and White Women, the Montreal disco-funk duo split the difference between roguish dirtbaggery and suited-and-booted sophistication. If their schtick ever felt overdone, then the duo were rolling their eyes harder. “Guys are all schmucks,” Dave 1 once said. “It would be funnier to embrace it.” Mixed by the New York DJ and Jessy Lanza collaborator Morgan Geist, the new album aims to correct the big-budget bloat and ill-fitting features of 2018’s Head Over Heels, and features La Roux as its sole guest. While a few songs here could be Chromeo canon, Adult Contemporary too often feels like a glossy recreation of their earlier sound that’s missing the idiosyncrasy and baked-in humor.The album is at its best when the new outlook prompts a change-up of Chromeo’s sound. The yacht rock-inspired “Friendsnlovers” is a wistful sigh that you can imagine soundtracking the bittersweet ending of a Netflix romcom, and “Words With You” is a deadpan boogie through ’80s disco-rock punctuated with a rubbery bass groove and celebratory horns. But at other times, the album sags under an overly liberal lacquering. The introspective ballad “A Cut Above” dissolves into its pillowy synth pads, and the pensive “Waiting for a Star to Fall” soundalike “Lonesome Nights” simply makes you want to revisit Mylo’s (better) flip of it.As much as the duo idolizes Bootsy Collins et al., Adult Contemporary feels like a well-made 2010s pastiche of disco-funk destined for a sponsored dance tent. (It’s as if the future-funk experiments of Thundercat and Steve Lacy—not to mention the pandemic-era disco explosion in pop—never happened.) The wry “Personal Effects” could be the title for a comedy of manners Noël Coward never wrote, but its retro flavor extends to its central figure of the “leave something behind” girl who sneakily “forgets” her phone charger at the narrator’s place. “Coda” feels like it primarily exists to showcase a punchline about “coda” sounding like “codependent,” trading in the lusty seductions of Chromeo’s funk forebearers for a buzzword cribbed from TikTok. Despite flashes of Adult Contemporary’s described maturity, the album generally prioritizes living large to the extent that, on the hi-NRG referencing “Ballad of the Insomniacs,” a maudlin insomniac wonders, “Where’s the party at?”But Jagged Edge they are not. Over 52 minutes, Chromeo’s exhortations to vibe begin to feel as repetitive as their album art, which this time features the suited duo alongside a woman whose clothes have fallen off. (They’re not Roxy Music either.) As with Solange’s divine cameo on White Women, the highlight of Adult Contemporary comes when a guest takes center stage. La Roux’s appearance on “Replacements” feels like a parting of velvet curtains, as if everything before were a warm-up. “Tried so hard to get you out of my head,” she sings, before a sly, very funny plot twist. “Oh, I wish you had a sister instead.” In 30 seconds, she nails the precise balance of pathos, warmth, and humor that Chromeo spend the record chasing.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

446,"The Miami producer’s debut morphs between ambient, downtempo, and dub techno. It’s as tranquil as an afternoon spent watching the clouds drift through the sky. When you’re a resident DJ at a powerhouse nightclub like Miami’s Club Space, versatility is key. Jonathan Trujillo—better known as simply Jonny From Space—has learned that from experience. His own music is rooted in the leftfield legacy of hometown acts like Phoenecia and their Schematic label; most of his bookings, in the more intimate Floyd (a club within the superclub) tend to be alongside like-minded souls like Ben UFO and fellow Florida DJ Danny Daze. But sometimes, the night’s billing dictates the vibe: Trujillo was once tasked with opening for an extended back-to-back set from EDM chameleons Diplo and Carnage—during Super Bowl weekend, at that. That very same week, he revealed a considerably different side of himself on his debut EP. A six-track compendium of ambient bubblers “made in altered states and meditative spaces,” the record suggested that the “Space” in his alias probably has less to do with his employer than it does his fascination with the outer limits.Over the past couple of years, Jonny From Space has built up a tidy discography of cosmically inclined material, some of it club-focused, and some not at all. On his debut album, back then I didn’t but now I do, he leans into his more introspective instincts, favoring measured tempos and feathery textures. The choice suits the label putting out the record: Jenny Slattery and Anthony Naples’ Incienso imprint, where Naples—originally known for his club productions—has increasingly turned his focus to cloud-watching vibes. But even at his most chill, Trujillo strikes an unusual balance here: His atmospheres may be wispy, but his drums are tough and resilient, sharp as a sudden jab to the sternum.The album opens on a resolutely downtempo note with “Crystal Eyes,” whose dubbed-out boom-bap and dreamy pads pay homage to smoker’s delights like Mo Wax’s classic Headz 2 compilation series, a cornerstone of mid-’90s trip-hop. Trujillo has a keen ear for contrast: The drum machine is crisp and declarative, yet the track’s tonal elements are unstable and amorphous, hard to get a bead on. The steady groove and flickering accents give the impression of a small town glimpsed from an airplane at night, lights twinkling in the darkness.A similarly heady vibe plays out across the record, as he wreathes knotty machine beats in gauzy synths and glowing haloes. When asked about his production methods, Trujillo once said, “I space out and start working on the drums until I have a locked groove. From there everything else just flows like water.” That approach shines through in tracks like “Live,” a sidewinding sketch made out of off-kilter clicks and cartoonish voices, as well as “Slip,” a moody, toe-scuffing hip-hop instrumental. For all the simplicity of his arrangements, they’re sneakily crafted: The beats twist up in ways you don’t expect, giving even his most relaxed cuts an unsettling air, as though everything could fall apart without warning.",Electronic,7.5
447,"The Los Angeles-based singer and producer trades the gospel of his previous work for sensual R&B, using the club as his canvas for tender odes to queer desire. According to memes and folklore, people who wear all-black Air Force 1s are menaces to society. Unkempt and ungovernable, they clomp through life indifferent to the dust accumulating on their kicks and the darkness gathering in their souls. The shoes are so maligned that even in Nelly’s classic paean to the Nikes, no one raps about or rocks black Forces. (One person does buy some.) Despite that stigma, serpentwithfeet dedicates a song on his third album to the quiet confidence of a guy giving off black Air Force energy in the club. “Ain’t nobody fucking with you,” he coos flirtatiously. Club scenes and sounds are fixtures of GRIP, which trades the gnostic gospel of the singer and producer’s past music for saucy R&B. serpentwithfeet has always been a student of the genre, but lately he’s been in active conversation with its history and motifs. DEACON wove Janet’s earnestness, Brandy’s vocal runs, and Darkchild’s quiet-storm fronts into tender odes to queer Black men. The record retained his signature interest in religious symbols and themes, but the music took more cues from R&B than gospel or electronic—a trend that continues here. Firmly planting a flag in modern R&B, serpent explores the ways that touch sparks and sustains romance.His songwriting is punchier and more direct in this purist mode. There are more come-ons and solicitations than innuendo or symbolism, a shift that fits the intimate theme. “Kiss you longer, longer than an opera/If we keep on dancing, we gon’ make love,” he sings on floorfiller “Damn Gloves,” framing a deep smooch as an intervention. The humid and pounding beat, produced by Nosaj Thing, I Like That, and serpentwithfeet, ups the urgency of the command. You can feel the charged proximity of the dancers’ bodies.The writing on “Safe Word” is just as loaded and beckoning. “The safe place is me, safe place is me,” he sings, declaring his body a sanctuary for a lover. Vocal processing embellishes the protective sentiment, smearing his words across Sensei Bueno and I Like That’s soft drums and cool melodies. serpentwithfeet notably treats his vocals throughout the album, rarely relying on his operatic falsetto. The choice feels intentional: As stunning as his upper register is, even at its most ecstatic, it exudes anguish and solitude. The breathy, immediate singing of GRIP is more conversational, evoking closeness, exchange, and community.The beats aren’t always as distinctive as serpentwithfeet’s storytelling and performances. The bass-heavy and uptempo arrangements of “Black Air Force” and “Rum / Throwback” bring to mind the generic fare DJs play when the club doors open. On songs about the meet-cutes and hook-ups that happen beyond the dancefloor, the production is more striking. “Deep End” is delightfully airy, gentle percussion and puffs of synth nudging along his dulcet melodies as he sings of a one-night stand that lasts 12 days. “Hummin” is built atop a slowed four-on-the-floor pattern that Stwo, Nosaj, and I Like That garnish with knocks and keys. The steady rhythm complements serpent’s sensual eruptions of melody.",Pop,7.7
448,"The UK rapper celebrates her wins and flexes her Portuguese on an EP that pulses and jumps with a funky digital spark. After half a decade staking her claim as one of the UK’s sharpest rappers, Little Simz is the most relaxed she’s sounded in years on Drop 7, the latest in a long-running EP series. While full-lengths like 2021’s Sometimes I Might Be Introvert and 2022’s No Thank You engaged big discussions of celebrity worship and exploitive music-biz politics with conceptual flair, the Drop series operates on lean efficiency. Take 2020’s Drop 6, which funneled pandemic isolation into tense soul-searching over moody, frenetic beats. Simz is still hungry on Drop 7, but it’s her first time in a while not fighting her way out of a corner. We rarely get to witness her working outside of statement-piece urgency.“Nothing left to prove ’cause I done enough,” she says bluntly on the glitching “Torch.” After winning the Mercury Prize and touring the world to the point of exhaustion, she’s standing in her accomplishments. There’s talk of seaside vacations, “building mansions up on Venus,” and sipping tea in her fortress of solitude. On “Fever,” she gets caught up in a fling while on vacation in São Paulo and flexes her skills in Portuguese. When she does come with venom, she delivers with cold sarcasm. “Talk behind my back and then they go into a shell,” she says in a breathy, TiaCorine-like tone, using her role on the Netflix crime drama Top Boy to remind folks just how much she’s holding back: “Shelley’s nail bar only exist on the TV.”After three stately albums produced by longtime collaborator (and SAULT bandleader) Inflo, this time Simz recruits British producer Jakwob to create sounds that pulse and jump with a funky digital spark. On opener “Mood Swings,” one of the more aggro songs, Simz darts between Jakwob’s synth plucks and drum hits while interpolating Solange’s “Binz.” But just as quickly, they dip into dance-friendly rhythms that Simz rides with the steadiness of an EKG machine. “Fever” and the booming centerpiece “SOS” both dabble in Brazilian funk; the stone-cold “I Ain’t Feelin It” cruises a metallic groove that wouldn’t sound out of place on a Surf Gang album; closer “Far Away” mixes rattling Jersey club beats with Social Experiment-esque horns that play up the melancholy in its story of lost love. The variety makes for a dark and sensuous mix worthy of a late night.Drop 7 is slight in the way all Simz’s Drop projects are slight—they’re musical side quests. Her music is rarely this loose, this willing to smell the roses, even while she’s got eyes in the back of her head. “Head hot, say the wrong thing, might lose it/But I’ma always channel through the music,” she says over the dubby drum slaps of “Power.” Where does Simz see herself right now? Far enough away from life’s stresses to tinker and ponder while at the top of her game.",Rap,7.5
449,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit Mariah Carey’s triumphant comeback, an album that captured the zeitgeist of 2000s R&B and resurrected a pop icon. Mariah Carey is zipping up to Harlem in Cam’ron’s purple Lamborghini when she suggests they ditch her security. It’s long past the middle of the night, they’ve outgrown the afters at her Tribeca penthouse and want some fun in the relative anonymity before dawn. Cam steps on the gas, gaining some distance on Carey’s detail in the SUV behind them, and speeds her to a brick church on 131st Street, where her great-aunt Nana Reese used to worship, and where her mother and father were married.In Carey’s recounting, this moment occurs after the release of 2002’s Charmbracelet, her ninth album, and as a prologue to the creation of The Emancipation of Mimi, the massive 2005 release that would reinvigorate a career that, at that time, many in the music industry and media had left for dead. She had weathered the chaotic rollout of her 2001 movie Glitter, a commercial flop reviled by critics. Its accompanying soundtrack was released on 9/11, which Carey watched live on television from the communal room of a Los Angeles rehab facility. (More than a decade later, Carey would reveal she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.)That July, she’d planned a stunt with MTV in which she rolled an ice cream cart onto the set of TRL to promote “Loverboy” and rambled a bit, calling it “my therapy session.” For the tightly controlled TRL, it was off-the-cuff and random, but after three decades of reality television, not that wild in hindsight. Yet host Carson Daly sniffed sensationalistically that “Mariah Carey’s lost her mind,” and the tabloids sneered that she was “crazy.” Her label, Virgin, paid her $28 million to leave its stable rather than put up with the flagging sales and negative press.Charmbracelet, the result of a bidding war won by Island Def Jam, was layered and introspective but didn’t shoot her to the peaks she’d achieved in the past. Yet by the time she was joyriding in Cam’s Lambo, she had reached peace with what she had overcome—Glitter and a sexist, racist media culture trading on schadenfreude, but also the aftermath of her controlling and coercive marriage to former label boss Tommy Mottola and her fractured relationship with opportunistic family members. Outside the crumbling Harlem church, Carey contemplated her great-aunt and grandmother’s ownership of several brownstones despite their lack of formal education, meditated on the cumulative effects of the Jim Crow South, and recalled her devout Nana Reese, an “extra-crispy Christian.”",Pop,9.0
450,"Channeling the sound and spirit of 2000s indie rock, the Chicago duo’s debut album feels like a generational passing of the torch. As you might expect from a scene named after a Neu! song, the young bands emerging from Chicago’s Hallogallo collective see themselves as torchbearers for previous generations of cutting-edge rock. Friko fit the mold, as a precocious pair namechecking ’90s indie rock, post-punk, Leonard Cohen, and, why not, Chopin. Someone who came of age in the early 2000s might also hear Saddle Creek’s all-hands, band-camp blowouts in Friko’s surging drama—or the blog-rock bands that made guitars and drums exciting again in the age of mashups, or maybe the buzziest act at a late-aughts CMJ showcase or Empty Bottle afterparty. But even if Friko recall the sound of those days, their debut album, Where we’ve been, Where we go from here isn’t just a throwback. It carries the spirit forward, reaffirming that indie rock, as a style and ethos, can still feel like the most exciting thing a young person could be into.Despite its bullish title, Where we’ve been doesn’t scan as a monolithic statement of purpose, but rather a presumptive greatest-hits compilation. It’s no slight to say that it could be just as enjoyable on shuffle; nearly every song feels designed to either begin or end a live set, whether at SXSW, Schubas, or even Bonnaroo. Only the finale, “Cardinal,” is locked into sequence as an acoustic comedown. Friko’s songs open grandly and gather intensity all the way through their equally grand closings; these aren’t just anthems in the abstract sense, they’re theme songs. And even when the lyrics turn desperate (“It doesn’t get better, it just gets twice as bad,” from the bittersweet, tightly wound “Get Numb to It!”), Niko Kapetan’s swashbuckling trill recasts the subject matter as a hero’s journey.“Twenty years spent above this place/You could smell the iron from the room,” Kapetan sings as the album’s preamble, a curious image that conjures the smell of blood, of trains, of something that should be in motion. From that point forward, Where we’ve been might as well be a blues album, given how much time Friko spend at a crossroads, forced to choose between struggle or complacency, life or death, going big or going home.Twin peaks “Where We’ve Been” and “Crimson to Chrome” cleverly reenact the pervasive drive to get out of a rut and into the groove, hammering at remarkably similar melodies until the arrangements crack open. “Chemical” sounds like it learned its riff from the Walkmen’s “The Rat”—and also, more importantly, that a song can be all tension for four minutes. When Kapetan yells the title over and over, the band shifts into what sounds like a truncated time signature, as if they need to knock out the chorus as quickly as possible before their studio time runs out. Even a song as blatantly bleak as “Get Numb to It!” can double as celebration rock, its a cappella finale sounding like a gang of drunken football fans chanting their school’s fight song hours after the home team has left the field in triumph.",Rock,7.9
451,"On their fifth album, the UK band enlist Nigel Godrich and Kenny Beats for a smoother, softer rock record that still fires its love songs from a cannon. Joe Talbot treats love like a four-letter word—meant to be shouted, loudly, like a bludgeon to the head. “Look at the card I bought/It says ‘I love you,’” the Idles frontman barked on 2018’s Joy as an Act of Resistance. In the intervening years, his own life experience—the birth of a child, a divorce, a new relationship—has only intensified the word’s meaning and laid bare the power it has over our relationships. While he claims that every Idles song is ultimately about love, leading up to the Bristol band’s fifth album, TANGK, Talbot honed his focus on the subject, reading bell hooks’ powerful 2000 treatise All About Love. But where hooks writes, “To open our hearts more fully to love’s power and grace we must dare to acknowledge how little we know of love in both theory and practice,” Talbot approaches the topic with a typically broad sense of authority and indignation. On TANGK, Idles smooth their rougher edges as they explore love in all of its facets—it would be their warmest and most melodic record to date, if only Talbot could get out of his own way.Writing about Idles’ most recent record, 2021’s Crawler, for this website, Stuart Berman wondered if, after a few false starts on an otherwise dark and driving record, they could go “full Kid A” and make the ambitious leap to a more experimental sound. The band seems to have taken his suggestion literally, re-engaging studio wizard Nigel Godrich to co-produce TANGK along with Kenny Beats, who formed an unlikely partnership with the band on their 2020 record Ultra Mono, and Idles guitarist Mark Bowen. The combined influences of each collaborator—Kenny Beats’ taut programmed drums, Godrich’s emphasis on melody and analog tape loops—mesh surprisingly well considering the producers’ disparate backgrounds. On “Gift Horse,” a thrumming bassline gives way to a kick drum that matches the elegant, muscular pacing of its equestrian subject, finding a phosphorescent midpoint between steely electronica and post-punk. “Grace” layers reverberating synths atop familiar drum and bass arrangements, lending a spectral, almost intangible quality to the song that Talbot echoes as he reaches for a thin falsetto. Lest you think Idles are not self-aware of this softer mode, the video for “Grace” is a shot-for-shot remake of Coldplay’s “Yellow” featuring a deep-faked Chris Martin.In Idles, Godrich saw a band he could mold, gently, in his image: “I thought it would be interesting to see how they would translate if he was a little bit more musical, if he sang more,” he said in a recent interview. Indeed, the record opens with a piano, padded drums, and Talbot’s textured croon, which does bring to mind Chris Martin. Perhaps counterintuitively for a frontman known for gnarled roars, it’s the most expressive he’s sounded. On “A Gospel,” a song that originally began as an iPhone demo from Bowen, featherlight piano and fluttering strings accompany Talbot’s wispy vocals, finding a softness just as emotionally potent as his fiercest howl. Closer “Monolith” oozes to life with a murky synth and a thin, trembling vocal from Talbot. But here, as his voice melts into a crackling saxophone, we’re left with an impressionistic glance, one that lingers after Talbot’s final note. It’s a welcome pared-back approach after a discography full of kitchen-sink catchphrase soup.",Rock,6.7
452,"With layered guitars, drifting arrangements, and gently ambiguous songwriting, Kayla Cohen and her band invoke dream worlds and trance states. Some people play the guitar like they want to caress it; some play like they want to destroy it. Kayla Cohen, who has been recording under the moniker Itasca for around a decade, handles the guitar like she is feeling her way through a lucid dream, cutting through the fog with bright, exploratory lines. Imitation of War, her first release in more than four years, makes the searching motion of her playing its motivating principle. The result is an album conversant in a certain language of post-punk, dual-guitar rock—that of, say, Television or Pavement—but whose animating spirit lies somewhere else entirely. Over a suite of patient songs that don’t so much stretch out as tunnel inward, Cohen and her band render richly textured guitar-rock dreamscapes that nonetheless feel grounded and immediate.Cohen’s songs can sound loose and jammy on a first listen. The delicate strummed figure that kicks off opener “Milk” quickly refracts into pinwheeling dual leads—both played by Cohen, uncannily evoking a live performance—before the band settles into a groove, anchored by Evan Backer’s sensitive bass playing and Daniel Swire’s crisp drums (Evan Burrows plays drums on two other tracks). Cosmic doodles of electric guitar wind their way around the spare, fingerpicked “Under Gates of Cobalt Blue.” But after a few listens, you start to feel the contours of a deeper sculptural form undergirding the music. Progressions postpone resolution; lyrics loop back on themselves like truncated villanelles. Cohen heavily favors suspended chord voicings that hover in a zone of harmonic ambiguity. Despite all the dreaminess, the sounds are warm and clear; there is very little reverb or other production shortcuts to transcendence—just a light coating of quavering chorus effect on the guitars. It is as if all the restless motion is happening on the surface of the music, and beneath it there is a vast, taut stillness.“Stillness” is the first word Cohen sings on Imitation of War, and it returns throughout in various guises. In the title track, she inhabits the perspective of a painter struggling to capture a flash of sublimity; she imagines herself as “a saint there on the chapel font”—which is to say, frozen, carved into a hard surface, potentially martyred. Even this grim form of inertia would offer reprieve, perhaps, from the shapeless turmoil the songs’ protagonists seem to face. They set out on quests: Some “set sail on the maelstrom” and travel the road to El Dorado, while others try for more metaphysical feats, like reaching out to touch a moment and threading tears through a needle’s eye. These songs are dream worlds where such things are possible. Cohen has explained in interviews that she wrote Imitation of War under the influence of Carl Jung, the Swiss psychoanalyst and mystic, theorist of dreams and archetypes. From him, she took the idea that a song can be an “alternate reality” accessible through a “trance state.”",Folk,7.4
453,"Mike Gordon’s debut album warps ’80s pop, rock, and R&B with idiosyncratic production, yielding strange, murky songs full of anxiety and longing. Mike Gordon’s mangled mix of pop, rock, and soul sounds like it’s made of scrap metal and polished with sandpaper. Across Two Star & the Dream Police, his magnificent debut album as Mk.gee, the 26-year-old from New Jersey subverts recognizable forms—’80s R&B ballads, Phil Collins-inspired downtempo anthems, Michael Jackson-meets-Arthur Russell pop-rock grooves—with unusual tones, tempos, and textures. His distinctive, distended guitar playing and Prince-indebted singing are pinholed through murky, twitchy mixes that refuse to stay still. Despite the elusive and exploratory nature of his music, Gordon is a master of melody, chiseling gorgeous, richly detailed pop songs from seemingly cluttered compositions. Two Star is as singular as it is familiar, an original and expansive record that feels at once timeless and uncannily contemporary.Although Gordon’s been releasing EPs and mixtapes since 2017, even landing a track on Frank Ocean’s Blonded Radio, many people first encountered him in 2021 as Dijon’s wiry, wild-haired guitarist. In a live performance of Dijon’s debut album, Absolutely, the pair play off one another in conspiratorial glee, Dijon in his olive fishing vest and Gordon with his ’60s-issue Fender Jaguar, both bounding about a gear-strewn dining room with childlike awe, howling and harmonizing and clapping until they can hardly stand up straight. Before Dijon met Gordon, the Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter’s brand of guitar-backed R&B was charming but safe, a collection of Blonde-lite songs that didn’t always extend past emulation. Gordon, however, offered Dijon a new rhythmic architecture, and freedom, to channel his gifts. “The real spirit of the record came when I formally met Mike,” Dijon recalled in a 2022 interview. Absolutely marked a significant leap for Dijon’s music, and he credited Gordon as an invaluable catalyst. “I think he might be creating or transmitting from an alien planet,” Dijon said in another interview. “It feels like this is the first music I’ve ever made.”Dijon appears to have helped Gordon make a similar leap of his own. Before Two Star, Mk.gee’s solo releases sounded like an offshoot of Toro y Moi or Unknown Mortal Orchestra, a pleasant array of sunny side-chained guitars, syncopated drums, and funky basslines. Two Star, though, signals a sea change for Gordon, who abandons easily deciphered mixes and clean song structures for strange, defiant choices that blister with anxiety and longing. Warbly electric guitar, spiraling saxophones, distorted synths, and two-bit toms splinter and scatter; Gordon’s raspy voice sounds as if he were in the next room, singing from a seated position on the floor. This is perhaps Dijon’s most obvious influence; before Two Star, Mk.gee was a tepid vocalist, but here he belts, coos, and moans with soulful, skin-tingling skill. And though the album has no obvious narrative, the oblique songwriting doesn’t detract from Gordon’s raging emotions. He’s desperate to be seen and to see, to stop hiding from the hard stuff and give himself to someone or something else, to embody a sense of self that feels safe and sustainable, at least for a little while.",Pop,7.8
454,"Kanye teams with Ty Dolla $ign for a project that actually sounds finished, but hardly puts anything worth remembering onto it. It’s fitting that the Yeezus album cover is a blank CD. It marked the end of an era in which Kanye West’s creative process was governed by the requirements of mass-producing a consumer good. Over the first decade of his career—culminating with that album in 2013—West was frequently divisive for reasons both musical and non-, but enjoyed an unbroken deluge of critical adoration. His grip on the culture began to loosen, however, right around the time paid streaming platforms collapsed the amount of time required to prepare a finished record for release to virtually nothing.Beginning with 2016’s The Life of Pablo, West’s albums have evidently become the products of frantic bursts of writing and recording. Twitter and Instagram document rappers and producers flying to meet West at the 11th hour or emailing songs back and forth; tracklists are adjusted after the files are uploaded to DSPs; things never really cohere. For example, 2021’s sprawling Donda circles a fascinating musical idea (the collision of gospel and digital, as distilled in the moment in “Hurricane” when a choir is cut off as if on a sampler) that would perfectly complement its lyrical concerns. But the album is too rushed and overstuffed to consistently articulate it.VULTURES 1—his collaborative album with Ty Dolla $ign—arrives at the end of a second, far more fraught decade for West. As the long, considered processes that yielded the songs on 2005’s Late Registration and 2010’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy disappeared, he began instead to draw attention for saying things like “slavery was a choice” and then apologizing; for making antisemitic remarks and then apologizing; for cozying up to Donald Trump and then apologizing—and then, on Monday, endorsing Trump for the 2024 presidential election. He has communicated erratically about his struggles with mental health, about his divorce from Kim Kardashian, and about those who have abandoned him and those who have, by God, remained loyal. Each new controversy frequently overshadowed the music he was trying to intermittently promote.In light of all this, VULTURES sounds almost disorientingly complete. The mix is crisp and it bears mentioning that there are no mumbled reference tracks. This is a value-neutral observation—some of the most interesting work from the second half of West’s career is unfinished, or sounds like it—but it gets at one of the most confusing aspects of the last few Kanye West albums: that the apparently unedited vocals of a person closely covered by tabloids have come to sound less distinct, occasionally even anonymous. Recall Ghana/Mali, Dior Homme, “These the Red Octobers.” Frequently, on 2018’s ye and on Donda, West sounded like an actor rehearsing his lines, only hinting at the way he would emote when the camera was turned on.",Rap,5.8
455,"The Toronto jangle-pop duo doesn’t attempt to upset the winning formula established on its 2021 debut; it just executes the same bittersweet moves with even more militaristic precision. For half a century, jangly guitar pop has been a reliable delivery vehicle for both irrepressible joy and aching melancholy; it’s the musical vantage point from which a sunrise and sunset both look the same. But the songs of Toronto‘s Ducks Ltd. don’t so much deal in simple happy-sound/sad-lyric dichotomies as explore the symbiotic relationship between ennui and urgency. Since debuting in 2019, the duo of Tom McGreevy and Evan Lewis has been building a modest but sturdy catalog of songs that communicate the frustration of being stuck—in stagnant relationships, soul-crushing cities, a doomed world—with fleet-footed, blurrily strummed joie de vivre. If McGreevy often sings from the perspective of someone in desperate need of motivation, Ducks Ltd.’s excitable rave-ups function as the musical equivalent of a fitness app prodding him to close his rings for the day.On their second album, Harm’s Way, McGreevy and fellow guitarist Lewis don’t do much to upset their winning formula; they just execute it with more militaristic precision. On the sprightly “The Main Thing,” McGreevy sings, “I've been sort of staying in my lane/Moving like the eyes in a painting”—a line highly reflective of a band firmly ensconced in its comfort zone, yet open to incremental yet impactful evolutions. For the first time, the musicians decamped from their makeshift basement studio in Toronto and recorded in Chicago, plugging into a local network of collaborators that includes producer Dave Vettraino (Deeper, Melkbelly), Dehd’s Jason Balla, and Ratboys’ Julia Steiner and Marcus Nuccio, among others. Ducks Ltd. remain hitched to a lineage that spans Antipodean ’80s indie greats like the Clean and the Go-Betweens and modern-day torchbearers like Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever; with its twangly guitar lines, picture-postcard scenery, and yearning romanticism, you’d swear “Cathedral City” was some bygone Grant McLennan gem. But the expanded cast helps Ducks Ltd. shake off the hermetic, home-recorded feel of 2021’s Get Bleak EP and its full-length follow-up, Modern Fiction, giving the songs more room to breathe and blossom.You can measure Ducks Ltd.’s relationship to—and growing distance from—their influences in their choice of railway metaphors: Where the Go-Betweens once wistfully compared unrequited desire to a “Head Full of Steam,” McGreevy renders a doomed partnership as a crash-bound “Train Full of Gasoline,” a song that aptly barrels forward like a runaway locomotive. Pretty much everything else on Harm’s Way is firing at an equally heightened level. The pacing is jacked up, the guitars sparkle brighter, and the harmony-rich choruses soar higher than before, even as the words sting more intensely: “Hollowed Out” is a song about emotional emptiness that will nonetheless fill your heart, while “A Girl, Running” frames its crestfallen portrait of relationship dysfunction and codependency (“She falls apart before me/And then I fall apart right back”) with shimmering guitar fanfare that conjures the giddy Breeders chestnut “Divine Hammer.”",Rock,7.7
456,"The Chilean rapper and singer’s unbreakable optimism and political conviction power an album animated by fresh explorations of pop ballads, reggaeton, and Afrobeats. Chilean artist Ana Tijoux cites this motto as inspiration for Vida: “Our best revenge against death is life.” Her first album in a decade is a joyous look at grief in all its forms, and Tijoux’s unflinching optimism remains one of the most refreshing parts of her work. Working with longtime producer Andres Celis, Tijoux returns with an effervescent blend of thumping hip-hop and Latin American rhythms, leaning into pop balladry alongside her deft rapping.After starting her career with Chilean rap group Makiza, Tijoux found international success as a solo artist. The title of her album 1977, released in 2010, marked the year that she was born in France to Chilean parents who’d fled the Pinochet dictatorship. Its introspective songs explored her family’s eventual return to Chile with a calm, decisive flow and jazzy production rooted in ’90s New York hip-hop. On 2011’s La Bala, Tijoux turned her focus outward, decrying economic inequality and referencing contemporary political movements including Chilean student protests, the Arab Spring, and Occupy Wall Street. On 2014’s Vengo, Tijoux brought Indigenous pride to the forefront. prominently featuring Andean flutes and making space for collaboration with other artists from the Global South, notably Palestinian rapper Shadia Mansour on the solidaric “Somos Sur.” With Vida, Tijoux continues to extend the invitation to fight injustice alongside her.While recording Vida in her new home city of Barcelona, Tijoux said, she spent time with a friend who’d worked as a clown to comfort people living in refugee camps across the Middle East. His ability to sustain hope inspired the slogan at the heart of the album. Though Vida is hardly rose-tinted, Tijoux is attuned to the promise of resilience and camaraderie. She champions this mentality on “Tania,” an ode to her late sister. What starts as a sentimental exploration of words left unsaid opens up into an electric cumbia celebration. Tijoux sings of channeling her sister’s warmth into her own daily life, whether planting a sunflower or dancing until dawn. She understands how a party can be a sanctuary—a place to exhale.Tijoux’s unwavering earnestness can sometimes take her into well-trodden territory. Empowerment pop like “Bailando Sola Aquí” (“Dancing Alone Here”) is a stale look at self-acceptance, depicting familiar images of searching for a partner to fill the void without the cheeky fun of a song like “Yo Perreo Sola,” Bad Bunny’s ode to twerking solo. “Millonaria” (“Millionaire”) reminds us that money doesn’t buy happiness—not a message that inspires the same fervor as the cries for class solidarity in 2020’s “Antifa Dance.” Despite a few duller moments, Tijoux keeps it interesting with a new embrace of reggaeton and Afrobeats on songs like “Cora” and “Dime Qué.” She can save the occasional clunky lyric with her effortless delivery.",Pop,7.3
457,"Usher’s ninth album is another impressive display of his endless charm and vocal chops. Thirty years into his career, the R&B icon still knows how to keep it light and throw a great party. I can’t be sure of this, but I feel fairly confident that Usher Raymond IV has never consumed a drop of milk. How else could you attribute the archival-grade preservation of his vocal cords, his leggero tenor as athletic and diamond-sharp as the day he dropped his self-titled debut in 1994—which, if you recall, was a whole 30 years ago? On Coming Home, his ninth album, his low warbles and falsetto are soft and airy, his natural register as creamy as the dairy he’s certainly never consumed. You can picture him pairing his kettlebell runs right alongside his vocal exercises, as pristine and optimized as any Southern former choirboy determined to stay at the top of his game.What went down at this year’s Super Bowl halftime show was everything that has made Usher into a pop icon: an old-school Hollywood entertainer whose choreography is always step-perfect and whose position as a multi-generational sex symbol is both good-natured and tasteful. Hordes of women, famous and otherwise, flocked to his Vegas residency for the Usher Seduction Experience, which included individual serenades that were so convincing they may have very publicly exploded at least one relationship (and produced a soundtrack for the meta-drama).On Coming Home’s 20 songs, he remains most comfortable and effective playing the sensual lover with come-hither abs, where even the most blatant sexual metaphor doesn’t come off as seamy. “Wanna cuddle in bed/Won’t just open your legs and then leave you for dead,” he sings on the sunny title track, which is also an extended allegory for an orgasm. On the album cover, he holds a Georgia peach in front of his shiny deltoids just so, projecting hometown pride and provoking deep lust. On “Stone Kold Freak,” his request for enthusiastic consent should come with a fainting couch: “Right after you make your decision,” he warbles confidently, “I’m gon’ make my incision, girrrl.” A business journalist should investigate whether he has stock in folding fans.As much as Usher plays up his lifelong amiable-ravisher persona on Coming Home, he maintains the versatility he’s established through the years, whether on enduring crunk hits like “Yeah!” or dance-music experiments like “Numb” and “DJ Got Us Fallin’ in Love.” Here his musical curiosity extends to amapiano, with Nigerian superproducer Pheelz joining him on the plush love song “Ruin” and a Burna Boy feature on “Coming Home,” while the delectable Tricky Stewart-produced electro jam “Keep On Dancin’” slide-glides its way around French house. The album sequencing divides these impulses into digestible and tonally paired sections—the bass-funk and backbeat of “I Love U” precede the baby-making midtempo jam “Please U,” both of which evoke Prince at his 1982 peak of shirtlessness, and pay homage with a wink, like Usher’s casually exhibiting his adaptability to the greats. “Big,” a horny song about a fat ass and, probably, his Magnum-wrapped anaconda, couches a salacious grin in a horn section and synth bassline reminiscent of Quincy Jones productions; “Luckiest Man” is an ‘80s throwback love song with a pristine synth cowbell that will leave you wistful and nostalgic for Al B. Sure!",Pop,8.0
458,"Kelela’s latest collection of remixes is an adventurous victory lap, plunging deeper into her world of aqueous R&B. In the beginning, Kelela aspired to sound like a remix. The artist once said that her interest in the form came from the attention to detail in UK garage and 2-step reworks, as well as the potential they offered to beam a singer’s vocals into radically new contexts. Together with her collaborators, Kelela sought to transpose the sensuality of R&B onto hard-hitting but finely crafted dance beats, mapping sleek hooks onto blasted-out electronics. The word most critics used to describe her music was “futuristic,” but in hindsight, her early recordings seem emblematic of a current of creativity that crackled in the air throughout the 2010s: one that was musically omnivorous, ultra-tactile, conceptually heady, and internationally minded. To revisit interviews published around the time of Cut 4 Me’s release is to encounter a world of cross-genre optimism, fueled by dreams of forging new connections across Black and queer club scenes worldwide. Back then, Kelela was the diva uniquely poised to bring those sounds to a wide audience.Fast forward 10 years. Kelela now exists among the upper echelons of stars called “mother” online; she is lovingly teased by fans for her inability to find a weed plug or protect her Twitter account from scammers trying to sell PS5s. She is a senior figure in a landscape of young musicians drawing on regional club music to great success. Last year’s Raven demonstrated how fully Kelela’s sound had transformed over the last decade of her career, as speaker-rattling R&G had been gradually phased out in favor of vaporous ambience. These new songs had formed, pearl-like, around a kernel of pain and insecurity, a “rustiness” she attributed to feeling exploited for her voice. Having accomplished the difficult task of piecing together a fractured sense of self on that record, Kelela’s latest collection of remixes is both a victory lap and something of a memory trip. Apart from reminding us of her career-long talent as a curator and executive producer, it’s her most uniformly satisfying and adventurous remix collection to date.In the past, Kelela remixes have traditionally split the difference between full-blown reimaginings and particle-collider deconstructions, with the latter tending to represent the more fun but overall weaker tracks in this category (think of MC Bin Laden’s Brazilian funk overhaul of “Rewind” or Divoli S’vere’s ballroom makeover of “Truth or Dare,” which were more compelling for their audacity than as actual pieces of music). RAVE:N, on the other hand, is distinct: Each track deepens the aqueous world of the original record. It seems inconceivable that “Contact” should work without its full-bodied Baltimore club pulse, but Karen Nyame KG manages to transform the song into something gorgeously weightless, placing Kelela’s vocals over an airy bed of synths and the faintest Afrobeat percussion, as if she were levitating. DJ Manny and Loraine James’ intricate drum programming adds some nervous ballast to their respective spins on “Divorce,” but the real magic lies in how they fold and layer the vocals so that the song’s depressive undertow and tortured thoughts come into greater conflict. It would be foolish to try and replicate the oceanic pull and release of the title track, so Agazero pitch shifts the singer’s voice and imposes a beat for the formidable Bbymutha to tear into, matching Kelela’s battle weariness with her own fierce resolve.",Pop,7.8
459,"This storied 1986 live bootleg captured the band on the cusp between New York Noise act and alt-rock behemoth. Thirty-eight years later, it finally gets an official release. If Manhattan’s misunderstood muck could talk—think smashed-up cigs, boot-trodden gum splotches, the strange liquid that oozes from certain subway stations—its voice would sound a lot like early-career Sonic Youth. Long before their weaponized tinnitus would take their music, and their tour van, across the globe, they occupied a derelict yet fertile corner of New York, where dissatisfied art types recognized the squalor of their city, processed it through shitty speakers, and threw it back in its face. This was a nascent, no-holds-barred iteration of post-punk, marked by left-field song structures, unforgiving decibel levels, and, in extreme cases, bloodied strumming hands. “I maintain that/Chaos is the future/And beyond it is freedom,” Thurston Moore deadpans in “Confusion Is Next,” from 1983’s Confusion Is Sex. To extract catharsis from chaos, you must first spend time at chaos’s altar.On paper, Moore’s declaration sounds vague, like the sort of thing a young eccentric might scribble in protest of detention. But it was also pretty prophetic: Spearheaded by Sonic Youth, indie rock’s next decade would seek strange beauty in the bizarre—tongue-talking pedalboards, battered whammy bars, feedback that foamed at the mouth. Pulled from three 1985 UK shows, Walls Have Ears pinpoints the band between sputtering sound system and well-oiled noise machine, soon to transcend fringe credibility for alt-rock titanhood. The record existed for decades as a coveted bootleg, originally issued without permission by Paul Smith, an early arbiter of their European releases. Thirty-eight years later, it still sounds like a smuggled good. The mixing is stuffy, low quality, borderline claustrophobic. It’s hard to listen without feeling, ever so faintly, like the walls are closing in, damning you to suffocation in a shaking hell. You can’t hide from the monster—and yet, for some reason, you don’t really want to.The collection offers a ragtag crash course in Sonic Youth’s first three records, interspersed with occasional cameos from the then-unreleased Evol. On raucous renditions of “Death Valley ’69” and “Kill Yr. Idols,” Steve Shelley’s drumming—at that point, a fresh addition to Sonic Youth’s apparatus—is enchanted and animalistic, a hungrier, more depraved engine behind tracks that already seemed murderous enough. “Brother James,” in particular, makes the version that appears on Confusion Is Sex sound pedestrian, maybe even polite. Kim Gordon wants to usher you “straight to hell”; Shelley’s thumps are the feet of the devil, dancing with glee at the sight of fresh meat. For all its audible stitched-togetherness, there’s value in hearing the entrails of Sonic Youth’s anarcho-apparatus spark into place, one by one. Midway through “Kill Yr. Idols,” when Moore hollers “Confusion is seeeeeeeex,” letting the “sex” hang just long enough for you to think about it, the naked guitar registers, uncannily, like the rasping throat of a ghoul. When Shelley and Gordon return to fill in the empty space, it’s one of those moments where you feel like the room is shrinking, an inch every beat.",Rock,7.8
460,"The second solo album from the Alabama Shakes singer-songwriter is musically muscular and thematically heady, a sound nerd’s project with stadium-sized panache. Almost immediately after Alabama Shakes broke through with tasteful retro-soul style, Brittany Howard pushed back against categorization. Her band’s Grammy-winning 2015 record, Sound & Color, borrowed from touchstones as far-reaching as Y2K post-punk, Erykah Badu, and Portishead, but it was Howard’s 2019 debut solo album, Jaime, where her experimentation truly blossomed. Its sound gravitated between quiet torch songs and raucous declarations that mixed funk-rock with electronica, bound by startling lyrics mined from Howard’s biography. What Now, recorded during the pandemic in Shawn Everett’s studio, is a different beast. Its subject matter is more gestural and existential—a love gone wrong, a call for peace, a bout of depression in the near future. It feels both looser and brawnier, a sound nerd’s project with stadium-sized panache and a grab-bag approach.What Now opens calmly enough, with crystal singing bowls and a few tentative piano chords and cymbal hits, as Howard narrates her trepidation. “But will I know?/Will I feel it?/The first moment that I see it?” she sings, her voice layered over itself in a blanketing echo. Then, with a whirling synth and explosion of drums, she’s off, blasting through the atmosphere, whizzing past soul, blues, funk, jazz, psychedelia, and house music. If Howard’s lyrics make it seem like she’s still working through things, her music sounds like she’s got it all figured out. Every song here, even the slow stuff, feels giant and propulsive—a grand celestial tour of rock and R&B, guided by one of the few singers and multi-instrumentalists with the range and intuition to pull it off.Howard is studied in the Stevie Wonder school of pulling a groove out of just about anything, thanks in part to her rhythm section here, drum virtuoso Nate Smith and versatile Alabama Shakes bassist Zac Cockrell. “I Don’t” builds around a melancholy chipmunk-soul hook in the vein of Cam’ron; “Patience” morphs from a bog-standard slow jam into a dazzling showcase of warped keyboard effects; at least one song features Howard banging on a trash can. There’s the muscular, airtight funk-rock of the title track, the frenetic boxed-in percussion of “Red Flags,” and a big swing at house music on “Prove It to You.” Yet some of the album’s most inspired choices have no rhythm at all. Between nearly every track, the singing bowls return, played by sound bath practitioners Ann Sensing and Ramona Reid, providing a brief respite and sealing What Now together like spiritual glue.",Rock,8.3
461,"Based on improvisation and collage, the trio’s excellent debut incorporates strands of new age, ambient, electronic, and jazz for an illusory, hypnotic experience. In textile art, when two bolts of silk are dampened and pressed together, a wavy, water-like pattern emerges known as moiré. This is because the gridded threads of one piece of fabric inevitably misalign with the other, such that the repeated differences in positive and negative space (the threads and the pockets of air between them) give rise to something entirely new. As a kind of illusion, moiré shows up everywhere: in physics, in graphics, and, as with The Closest Thing to Silence, in music.The Closest Thing to Silence is a collaboration between the seasoned French ambient composer Ariel Kalma and L.A.-based experimental duo Jeremiah Chiu and Marta Sofia Honer. The trio first teamed up in 2022, when Kalma tapped Chiu and Honer to work on a session for BBC 3’s experimental Late Junction series. They hit it off and then went on to create The Closest Thing to Silence, with Honer on viola, Kalma on woodwinds, Chiu on drum machine/samplers, and all three contributing synth work. Based on improvisation and collage, the album collates superimposed lines and images, found sound, and space in ways that feel simultaneously organic yet precise.On the title track, the trio creates a Penrose staircase of ascending and descending patterns. Over sustained saxophone tones, a synth motif climbs gently upward before falling back and starting over again. Textured cabasa keeps time alongside a pendular staccato figure that eventually loops back on itself and begins to phase shift. Hypnotic, offset rhythmic phrases like this recur throughout the album. “Écoute Au Loin,” for instance, displaces one sax line against another in a way that recalls the pulsing interference patterns of Terry Riley’s “In C.” Midway through, everything but a dotted figure drops out, and Kalma’s voice enters in three overlapping waves, repeating, “So I’m going to play today/And see/If you are interested/To make layers.”Layering and exploration are perhaps the animating forces behind the entire project. This is especially clear in “Dizzy Ditty,” which recalls Mort Garson’s Mother Earth’s Plantasia, or a pleasant mushroom trip through an 8-bit forest. A dotted, marimba-like synth totters about; flutes trill and meander like birdsong; strings vibrate like light. It is at once pointillistic and impressionistic. Similarly, “Stay Centered” sounds like it could be an educational ’90s VHS tape about plant cell biology. Little tintinnabulations bookend the track as if announcing the beginning and end of a stretch of active synth mitosis. “New Air,” by contrast, plays less in the light and more in the shadows. Raindrop sounds and fuzzy atmospherics recall the eléctrica selvática music of artists like Chancha Via Circuito and Nicola Cruz.",Experimental,8.0
462,"The British singer and producer delivers a satisfying little blast of club-pop bangers, channeling the big-room bliss of mid-’00s dance hits. Whether you like it or not, the mid-2000s are back, their pungent odor hanging in the air like the stale Red Bull fumes in your hometown’s worst club. The 2006 dance mashup “Perfect (Exceeder),” by Dutch musician Mason and American rapper Princess Superstar, is trending on TikTok, thanks to its inclusion on the Saltburn soundtrack; Charli XCX’s new single sounds like it’s trying to resuscitate the legacy of British house duo Bodyrox and singer Luciana’s 2007 hit “Yeah Yeah”; and Kanye has reportedly hired disgraced American Apparel founder Dov Charney as the new CEO of Yeezy. Blane Muise, aka Shygirl, has been on this tip for a while, and her new EP, Club Shy, suggests that she’s more equipped than most to bring the sound back into the mainstream. It’s a fairly conventional set of club bangers done right: This is an alluring, nonchalant flex between albums that’s weird enough to drop in the hyperpop Discord, but satisfying enough to play at your next birthday party.At 16 minutes, Club Shy is short, but it covers a lot of ground. Across the record, Muise cedes a lot of space to like-minded collaborators; much of the time, they emphasize her vaporous vocals, but there are a few scene-stealers in the mix. Empress Of, on a hot streak after memorable collaborations with Rina Sawayama and MUNA, sounds charged and sinuous on the stripped-back house jaunt “4eva,” practically upstaging Muise with a half-sung, half-rapped verse that’s charismatic and catchy. Irish musician Cosha adds earthiness to the EDM throwback “thicc,” her rich vocals surging over the breakneck big-room production.These songs offer simple pleasures, but they’re not uncomplicated. “tell me,” a simmering deep house cut produced by Boys Noize, plays like a club track written from the point of view of your wallflower friend, all libidinous desire and desperation without physical payoff. On “thicc,” the promise of a club hookup isn’t all it’s cracked up to be; Muise flits between intensity and coolness, but the focus is always on her sense of introspection, rather than the passion of the moment. Once you move past the brash exterior, it’s clear that Shygirl’s music is powered by tension and ambiguity as much as it is by spine-tingling drops.In this sense, Muise’s clearest antecedent isn’t necessarily Madonna or Róisín Murphy, two progenitors she’s cited as influences, but Katy B, another south London diva who tapped into the yearning potential of the city’s slinky underground club music. Club Shy, with its dual impulses towards confessionals and crowd-pleasers, often recalls Katy’s classic debut On a Mission, enough that you leave hoping there’s a Shygirl/Benga link-up on the horizon. Like Katy, Muise seems to understand that shyness and ravenous desire aren’t at all mutually exclusive: Tears might just look like sweat under flashing club lights.",Electronic,7.5
463,"Slutever’s Rachel Gagliardi revs up big, glittery power-pop hooks for an album devoted to getting out of your own head and staying young at heart. In 2013, Rachel Gagliardi felt something inside her shift. While the Slutever drummer and guitarist still believed in her bratpunk band’s motto—friends first, bands second—she was craving some creative self-discovery. Gagliardi made a pact with Michelle Zauner, then playing in Little Big League, to pursue song-a-day solo projects, publishing them to a joint Tumblr account alongside gifs of TV’s stifled women letting off steam: Marceline, Betty Draper, Chibi Moon. Zauner’s turn toward indie rock spawned Japanese Breakfast; Gagliardi’s power-pop songs birthed Pouty. While Zauner’s new band took off, Gagliardi held hers close to the chest, riding out Slutever and joining members of Hole and Vivian Girls in the grunge-pop group Upset.A decade later, Pouty’s debut studio album has finally arrived. When Gagliardi poked her head out as Pouty with 2016’s Take Me to Honey Island and 2017’s Saint Mary of the Moods EPs, she embraced spacious, fuzzy pop songs akin to early Best Coast with a rough edge. On Forgot About Me, she’s laser-focused on glossy pop-rock, leaning into big production and bigger hooks with the confidence of someone who’s tried on enough pants to shop without hitting the dressing room. Instead of playing every instrument herself like before, Gagliardi calls the shots as bandleader, directing longtime collaborators including guitarist Evan Bernard, bassist Cat Park, and drummer Jarret Nathan. The wick of solo projects is determination—to prove your ideas are worthy, to uncover hidden parts of yourself—and Gagliardi proudly watches it burn. “Denial is a heavy drug,” she sings, as if addressing her bandlocked younger self.Much of Forgot About Me is devoted to the teen girl aesthetic, and not simply because Gagliardi has ribbons in her hair or charms on her jewelry. She sings about astrological stereotypes, all-consuming infatuation, and crying in cafes. Her sugary voice is indulgent, but she’s quick to dissolve it in the noise-pop absinthe of songs like “Kill a Feeling.” Even her one-liners could’ve been sponsored by gel pens: “Life is no way to treat the living,” “I’m warning you right now that sometimes I’m insane.” Album opener “Salty” is a splash pool of power chords, cymbal crashes, and Wurlitzer with a delightfully catchy chorus. “I bet you almost forgot about me,” Gagliardi sings, before following up with a smirk: “I’m not embarrassed.”Gagliardi is now 34, but Pouty recognize that rock’s teen girl aesthetic has no real expiration date. Olivia Rodrigo was 18 when she plastered her face with butterfly stickers, but Slutever were 23 when they doodled on a composition notebook and Courtney Love immortalized the crying beauty queen look at 30. Whether walking the hallways of Rookie or holding her baby daughter in a Pouty music video, Gagliardi is a trusted source because her themes are universal. More than a fashion trend, the teen girl aesthetic celebrates pursuing creativity, dreaming freely, and seizing your independence. It’s trading friendship bracelets inside football stadiums regardless of age or gender. It is, as Pouty posits on “The Big Stage,” staying young at heart, even when your newborn is a living measuring stick for your own age: “Now I’m allowing myself to dream/What if you stopped standing in your own way?”",Rock,7.5
464,"After touring with Harry Styles, the Nashville songwriter returns with another showcase for her clear, expressive voice and exquisite sense of melody. Falling in love can be beautiful, but isn’t it kind of absurd and mortifying, too? This paradox is at the heart of Weird Faith, the new album from Nashville singer and songwriter Madi Diaz. She approaches it with an impeccable sense of melody and a series of potent questions, the kind that run like a third rail underneath a new relationship’s honeymoon phase (and, often, its decline): “Do you think this could ruin your life?” “How well do you wanna get to know me?” “Is it hard to love me?”Diaz got her biggest break as a solo artist a couple years ago, after releasing 2021’s stellar History of a Feeling. But her resume runs much deeper: A Berklee dropout, she moved to Nashville, then L.A., then back to Nashville to work as a songwriter, contributing to tracks for artists like Kesha and Little Big Town and writing music for soundtracks and commercials. All the while, she was writing and recording solo albums that struggled to find their footing. History of a Feeling kickstarted a dramatic shift in her trajectory. That record documented the end of a long-term relationship, which coincided with the start of her ex-partner’s gender transition—a complex, nuanced denouement that she captured in perceptive, charged, and occasionally excruciating folk-tinged indie-rock songs. From there, things took off: her first solo tour in almost a decade, TV bookings, and tours opening for indie icons (Waxahatchee, Angel Olsen) and even a pop megastar (Harry Styles, whose touring band she briefly joined).Though Diaz has played for stadium-sized crowds, Weird Faith is not a record of bright lights and pyrotechnics, but a document of particular, personal idiosyncrasies—like a domestic fantasy that ends with death on the swooning “Kiss the Wall,” or the way she turns every teenager’s favorite lewd party game into an ode to complicated coexistence on “KFM.” Her lyrics dig into details, zeroing into some particularly strange moments in relationships: the weirdness of continually running into your partner’s ex (“Girlfriend”); the painful middle of a slowly fizzling romance (“For Months Now”). Diaz doesn’t veer much from the straightforward production that marked History of a Feeling, but she knows how to add layers of sound to inject a little catharsis, like the brief, fuzzy squall in “Kiss the Wall” or the kaleidoscopic overlay of voices towards the end of “God Person.”Diaz’s voice is resonant and emotionally rich—sometimes pleading, sometimes dejected, sometimes a gentle whisper and occasionally a powerful belt—and her ear for melody is exquisite, filling her songs with crisp, memorable hooks. This combination helps make even her broadest gestures, like the waltzing breakup ballad “Don’t Do Me Good,” a duet with Kacey Musgraves, feel lived-in but not overworked. This is particularly true of the moving title track, cowritten with Americana stalwart Lori McKenna. It’s an ode to continuing to believe—not just through the awkward beginning of love but also through the trials and heartbreak that can follow—that vulnerability is worth the risk. This theme could land Diaz in Hallmark-card territory, but the song’s intimacy and restraint—just Diaz’s warm and weary voice and an acoustic guitar—make it instead feel like a gentle pep talk from an older sister. Hoping for love after getting burned a few times can be absurd and mortifying in its own way; here, Diaz makes a compelling case for it anyway.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

465,"The Norwegian duo’s new EP chronicles the rise of a fictional 2000s pop star. It’s got all the glitz and glamour of that era, plus a little art-pop edge. Scraped together from the dregs of the aughts and the higher end of fast fashion, Allina is the brainchild of French womenswear line All-in Studio (from which the character takes her name) and the Norwegian twosome Smerz. The fictional newcomer and her self-titled debut EP premiered together at the label’s SS24 Paris show last fall. Despite its billing as a collaboration, Allina is essentially a Smerz project; Henriette Motzfeldt and Catharina Stoltenberg share vocals and production like they do on any other Smerz release. But unlike the beguiling art pop the pair is known for, Allina is a welcome turn toward 2000s-era electroclash and the commercial pop/R&B of Cassie, Ashanti, and Blackout-era Britney. Motzfeldt and Stoltenberg pad the EP with short, spoken-word interludes meant to flesh out the protagonist’s narrative. With a characteristically minimalist approach, the duo pairs low-lit synths, sparse drums, and fuzzy guitars with knowing lyrics that bite with edgy self-awareness. It’s Smerz’s most unabashedly pop-oriented release yet.The humor on this EP is so understated, if you blink, you might just miss it. On “The Stylist,” the voice of Allina proclaims, “A lot of boobs but I still look thin.” When she deadpans, “And when you came, I screamed so loud” on “New Shoes,” the word “came” does double duty, referencing both the arrival of the shoes in question and the act of ejaculation. In case the come-on wasn’t obvious enough, a quick synth blast punctuates the end of the phrase, as if to mimic an orgasm. Allina leans into this type of sardonic play, echoing the sarcastic takes on feminine ideals of romance from Smerz’s first two EPs.Nothing is done without purpose on this economical studio offering. Where the “small songs” on the duo’s 2021 LP Believer intentionally threw off the album’s momentum and contributed to its enigmatic nature, the 30-second interludes across Allina serve as buffers in between the four songs, teasing ideas like dangling modifiers. But for what they lack in substance, they make up for in rhythmic pacing, with subtle cues propelling each song into the next like an assistant ushering Allina to her next gig. For one, there’s the synthline that opens both “Dangerous” and the title track; then there’s the sound of flashing cameras on “Paparazzi” and the first few seconds of the EP. With a tight runtime of around 12 minutes, Smerz make use of every spare moment. Across Allina, the pair’s roughest edges and pop-leaning predilections combine for a smooth joyride that tantalizes just enough to leave you wanting more.",Pop,7.4
466,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit Mercury Rev’s 1991 debut, a heroic dose of psychedelic rock that is equal parts nerve-wracking and awe-inspiring. Sure, you could look at the birth of Lollapalooza in 1991 as the tipping point when American counterculture turned into big business. But you can’t deny, on those early tours, a lot of insane shit went down. To date, it remains the only festival where you could watch Flea drink Jim Rose’s bile, Eddie Vedder dangle precariously from 30-foot-high scaffolding, and Rage Against the Machine exercise a less-rock/more-cock policy. Ultimately, there were limits to this lawlessness—as one band discovered, it was, in fact, possible to be too weird for Lollapalooza.On June 26, 1993, Mercury Rev appeared on Lolla’s second stage at the Fiddler’s Green Amphitheatre in Greenwood Village, Colorado, slotted between “a guy juggling chainsaws” and Tool. Like most of their sets from that era, their performance climaxed with an extended jam on “Very Sleepy Rivers,” the sinister, psychedelic hallucination that closes their 1991 debut album, Yerself Is Steam. But where the song normally provided the band with an opportunity to zone out and surrender to the squall for 15 minutes, on this day, their noise bath was rudely interrupted: After their onstage volume level suddenly dipped, the band noticed their soundman being violently pulled away from the board by security, bringing the set to an abrupt end.As it turns out, the mayor of Denver was strolling the Lollapalooza grounds and stumbled upon Mercury Rev’s set. He was so sufficiently traumatized by what he heard, he demanded an immediate shutdown. In his estimation, the band sounded “like a bus idling out of control,” and unbeknownst to him, the mayor was actually offering up an astute piece of music criticism. In their formative years, Mercury Rev really did sound like a careening bus headed towards a fiery crash—one where half the people on board were frantically fighting each other for control of the wheel, and the other half were in the back obliviously singing nursery rhymes as the whole bucket of bolts went up in flames.Hindsight positions Mercury Rev as rare American entrants in the early-’90s shoegaze fuzzbox wars, a claim supported by UK tours with Ride and My Bloody Valentine. But if shoegaze was a collision of melody and noise, both of those elements were generally tuned to the same psychedelic frequency. What Mercury Rev captured on Yerself Is Steam was less a melding of disparate sounds than a battle royale of oppositional ideologies: order and anarchy, ecstasy and terror, purity and perversion.",Rock,9.3
467,"On his debut for Third Man, the prolific Nebraska rocker tames his wild side but still lands some magnetic songs. David Nance seems like a true rock’n’roll apostle. Tell him about a record you love—especially in his personally fertile triangle anchored by Neil Young, MC5, and Faust—and the mid-Nebraska native might reveal his secret codex of deeper cuts with glee. For a decade now, Nance’s own music has gushed from that same wellspring, a torrent of two dozen LPs, EPs, and singles that map his many enthusiasms. On 2016’s More Than Enough, he slipped from New Zealand pop bittersweetness to full-choogle vamps in half an hour; he started 2022’s wonderfully warped Pulverized and Slightly Peaced with a two-minute, anti-capitalist barnburner about sandwiches and ended with a curled Crazy Horse jam about the crumbling New Age. Nance has even taken to making barely rehearsed, full-length covers of touchstones: Beatles for Sale, Doug Sahm and Band, Lou Reed’s Berlin. If Midwest boredom can create a vacuum, Nance’s now overflows with the blessed zeal of a beatific lifer.But David Nance & Mowed Sound—the self-titled debut of his newest configuration of familiar Omaha friends—suggests a limit to this vintage discipleship for the first time. This is Nance’s debut on Third Man, following appearances on Ba Da Bing! and Trouble in Mind that were occasionally so intoxicating they intimated the rise of some anachronistic latter-day rock star, gloriously unkempt and unbound. These 10 songs survey Nance’s usual range, with doffs of the beard to Canned Heat, the Kinks, Skip Spence, and Gram Parsons.It also feels circumscribed and safe, though, as if Nance and a band capable of truly cutting loose tried to make their own modern classic rock LP by forsaking the weirdness and wildness that made them special. (This same band, Nance included, is much sharper on Bite Down, the forthcoming LP from Rosali Middleman.) Ever zoom in on a soft-focused picture that appeared magical from a distance, only to find its charm diminished as the supposed details never actually resolve? This record confirms Nance’s work has always been that way—better blown out or faded away, not up close and clean like they are here.To be clear, there are absolute jams here, searing reminders of or mighty introductions to Nance’s antiquarian power. “Mock the Hours” barrels from the gates like an Allman-powered anthem, Kevin Donahue’s drums kicking the shit beneath Nance’s crosscut riff. Howling from rock’s under-funded fringes about outlasting long odds, Nance sounds like the leader of some mid-’90s alternative-rock band whose regional hit somehow broke big. It’s an inescapable tune, its sharp hook set into place by piano that pokes like fingers to the ribs. “Credit Line” turns a similar trick, its lithe little lick seemingly exported duty-free from some Mississippi roadside dive. It scores Nance’s lament perfectly. The compulsive mantra of “Cure Vs. Disease,” the winking fuck-you refrain of “Side Eyed Sam,” the rhythmic moan of “Cut It Off”: There is no doubt on Mowed Sound that Nance can write and lead a tune. Each song is a crosshatch of touchstones iconic, obscure, and everything in between—ZZ Top to Otha Turner, John Lee Hooker to Little Feat. Here is Nance’s record collection as potent distillate.",Rock,6.7
468,"Roberto Carlos Lange eases back into the groove with a gorgeous, delicately rendered album. It’s got space-age synths, wistful romance, and the breeziest vibe in town. In a short film about the making of Phasor, Roberto Carlos Lange’s eighth album as Helado Negro, the multi-instrumentalist songwriter says that “slow clouds and soft heat became symbols of long hikes through the mountains, and the noise for these songs.” His environmental inspiration ripples through nine beautiful tracks with a faint and visceral touch—like the effect of clean country air in your lungs that, almost without notice, gives you more energy than usual.Lange’s specific temperament is a boon in a turbulent culture; his music reflects a gentle soul who encourages slowness and contemplation. But love has always been the message with Lange, an experimenter under the guise of a traditionalist, whose work in English and Español has snuck a folk songwriter’s sensibility into twinkling electronic cut-ups and field recordings. Phasor uses blank space a bit more liberally than 2021’s Far In, and here his expressions of affection feel as organic as the scenery he strives to capture. “And I’ll go outside, looking at the moon way too long,” he harmonizes with the pianist Opal Hoyt on “Best for You and Me,” his melancholic tone vague and aimed heavenward. On “I Just Want to Wake Up With You,” Lange captures one of the simplest moments of intimacy—a nice morning rise with your nearest and dearest—inside a cascade of rhythmic squelches.The inciting moment for Phasor came in 2019 when Lange spent five hours with the Sal-Mar, a large-scale, one-of-a-kind synthesizer constructed in 1969 by the contemporary-classical composer Salvatore Martirano, who had the idea to use spare supercomputer parts to make an interactive “composing machine.” In Lange’s time interacting with the instrument at the University of Illinois, where it resides, he wrote sounds that bubble up in the crevices of Phasor, conveying ideas through simplicity and repetition whether lyrically or melodically. With the Sal-Mar’s sequencing employed in such a human and heartfelt album, it provokes some interesting thoughts about numbers, fractals, the nature of matter, the great interconnectivity of all beings, et cetera.It seems significant that album opener, “LFO,” or Lupe Finds Oliveros, is a tribute to electronic composition icon Pauline Oliveros and Lupe Lopez, an original wiring technician for Fender amplifiers known in at least one corner of the internet as “the goddess of soldering.” The concept is literal—the reverb is centered alongside spacy sound snippets—but also posits music as a form of transcendental escape. “Un policía me pegó me dejó por muerto/Y le dije/¿Quién eres tú?” he sings stridently, and then: “¡Y ya sé quien soy!” Who is this cop beating him down, he asks, but at least Lange knows his own self. He then escapes into what sounds like a chopped-up mariachi sample, light cacophony with the echoes of a phasor, the guitar pedal that’s best known as the dub reggae sound. (“I don’t own one,” he admitted in a recent bio, “but I did try to emulate that sound where I can on the record.”)",Electronic,8.3
469,"Two dyed-in-the-wool New Yorkers unite for a sharp, mellow, and only a little greasy slice of hip-hop. In a rap underground filled with larger-than-life neo-noir capos and bruised anti-heroes cut from the cloth of Roc Marciano and Ka, a rapper like CRIMEAPPLE stands out from the pack. The Colombian-born, Hackensack, New Jersey-raised MC isn’t as outrageous as Westside Gunn or Action Bronson, but his references and frequent jumps between rapping in Spanish and English give his bars a more subdued grace. He’s not above the occasional showy display—he once compared his wallet to the chunky figures painted by artist Fernando Botero—but he takes more pride in direct flexes when he’s not focusing on the struggles that led to the riches.In the opening seconds of “El Léon”—the title track of his collaborative album with producer Preservation—he relishes traveling often enough for custom agents to recognize him. But amid the talk of swapping Jaguars at the dealership and coming from the dirt, the simplest boast hits the hardest: “Lil’ homie, I own shit.” Throughout El Léon, bittersweet anecdotes like these are matched with tawny sample loops that have the worldly poise of a high-end travel show.For his part, Preservation rises to a different challenge while working with CRIMEAPPLE. Most of the beats the New York-based producer has created since 2015’s Days with Dr. Yen Lo have put a minimalist spin on the gritty New York sound. But as opposed to his 2020 Eastern Medicine, Western Illness and 2022’s billy woods teamup Aethiopes, El Léon keeps things a bit more traditional. Strange, off-kilter samples—from guitar twangs and sour horn fills to merengue rhythms—are folded into more rigid shapes that suit CRIMEAPPLE’s generally less adventurous flows. Songs like “Don’t Mention It” and “Vida Mantequilla” march closer in line with his work on Yasiin Bey’s The Ecstatic or as a member of the rap quartet Sonic Sum. Even the more outrê stuff—the pitter-patter drums and organs on “Paw Prints in the Sand” or the tambourine and deep piano stabs that power lead single “Hunting Methods”—splits the difference between Black Sunday-era Cypress Hill and the hotboxing expansiveness of his most recent work. Preservation sacrifices a bit of his eccentricity to meet CRIMEAPPLE at his more mellow level, but it’s a worthy tradeoff.CRIMEAPPLE may not be the flashiest rapper, but his technique and perspective keep his bars sharp. He often plays close to the rhythm of the beat but will occasionally speed his tempo up, especially when he switches between languages. This happens several times on the title track, where threats, slang, and stories of “spending purple paper” are smushed into compact bars. His opening quotables can also be as unpredictable as his language-switching. On “Vida Mantequilla,” he whispers “I’ve never had a White Claw in my life,” ethering the alcoholic seltzer before joking about a date who was built like a Nachos BellGrande from Taco Bell. Without an over-the-top voice or personality, the color in his writing pops more, like the side character in a movie who’s later revealed to be the villain. Even at their most boisterous, Pres’ beats keep things lively without overwhelming CRIMEAPPLE’s presence—he sounds comfortable sifting through the blaring horns on “Don’t Mention It” and the shrieking violin streaks on “Melena Dorada.”",Rap,7.5
470,"Assisted by producer Dave Sitek, the goth-folk shapeshifter explores a new dimension of her sound, bringing electronic atmospheres and industrial menace to an album about submitting to the unknown. With a coil of black hair always in her eyes, Chelsea Wolfe is a sibylline force with a voice to match. For the 40-year-old goth rocker—a self-described witch and native Californian, though you’d never guess the latter from her shell-pale skin—her earthly occupation as singer-songwriter has meant making singular Bauhaus-goes-folk music and, too often, drinking to excess, although that habit predated her singing; in interviews, she remembers being 11 years old with a 40 in her hand.She quit alcohol in 2021, after releasing 2019’s Birth of Violence and before her soundtrack for the scary sexploitation movie X, a collaboration with producer Tyler Bates, came out in 2022. Beneath its shocking darkness, the Ti West-directed feature is about the persistence of desire. She Reaches Out to She Reaches Out to She, Wolfe’s seventh album and first for Loma Vista Recordings, likewise clears away dirt and empty bottles to find hope. With production from TV on the Radio founding member Dave Sitek, Wolfe zeroes in on the clearest message in her discography yet: surrender your heart to the unknown. Where most of Wolfe’s albums have shown anxious restraint, She Reaches Out yields to hair-in-the-wind havoc with distorted layers of guitar, drum pads, electronics, and piano, a more confident blend of Wolfe’s metal melancholy.Occasionally, the unknown is monstrous. Wolfe has always demonstrated a predilection for gross and terrible things, including on the particularly sludgy 2017 album Hiss Spun, which abounds in bloody angels, gashes, and groans. Outside of music, Wolfe’s dreams are full of heavy black shadows—nearly every night since childhood, she has been gnawed by sleep paralysis, which can freeze your body and fill your room with imaginary demons. Lyrics on She Reaches Out to She Reaches Out to She offer a guiding hand through this terror, promising that you can coexist with the monsters. “The Liminal”—sort of a dusty, creepy, eight-legged version of Succession—dares you to. As longtime collaborator and multi-instrumentalist Ben Chisholm plunks out a sorry piano melody, Wolfe hisses like a sorceress in the woods, watching you from 10 feet away: “All you ever wanted was the liminal/All you left behind was your exoskeleton.”Wolfe is good at pointing you closer to strangeness; its pull lies in the all-consuming guitar/synth torrential downpour that soaks the entire album. Sometimes, She Reaches Out drowns in it: Songs like the Lorn-ish dark synth track “Tunnel Lights” feel like they’re marching awkwardly, not forebodingly, wearing all those soggy, indistinguishable layers. More often, though, Wolfe likes indulging in half-seconds of silence, a blink of sunlight before guitarist Bryan Tulao comes in to blow a bullet hole through the mirror. This approach, another way Wolfe honors intangible, in-between space, is most potent on groaning closer “Dusk.” Everything except a misty drum pad drops out for Wolfe to sing a vow—“I would go through the fire/To get to you”—and then, one breath later, Tulao delivers a deliciously simple, traffic-stopping solo.",Rock,7.6
471,"Celebrating its 50th anniversary, a new expanded edition revisits the album that burnished McCartney’s critical reputation after the Beatles’ breakup, reestablishing as a force to contend with. Band on the Run turned 50 at the end of last year, and a new expanded edition—its fourth—celebrates the anniversary. As the proliferation of reissues over the years suggests, it’s Paul McCartney’s most consequential post-Beatles record, if not necessarily his best: the album that revived his critical fortunes and established him as a powerhouse outside his former band.McCartney’s career was hardly languishing when Band on the Run appeared at the end of 1973. Earlier that year, Red Rose Speedway became his second album to reach No. 1 in the U.S., with the dreamy ballad “My Love” topping the Billboard charts and his James Bond theme “Live and Let Die” coming close. Yet his critical reputation was at a nadir, lacking the countercultural cachet of either John Lennon or George Harrison, ex-bandmates whose early-’70s successes hit the sweet spot where the underground and mainstream met. Cast as the primary culprit in the Beatles’ demise, McCartney was portrayed as a careerist control freak who specialized in featherweight pop.But following the Fab Four’s breakup, McCartney hardly had a master plan. Newly married to the former Linda Eastman, he moved to a farm in Scotland and then revived an idea he had for the Beatles in their waning days: to get back out and play rock’n’roll as part of a group. As he recently told Mojo, he realized his path forward was “to get a band that isn’t massively famous, to not worry if we don’t know what we’re doing because we would form our character by learning along the way.”An essential part of that fledgling band was Linda McCartney, who previously hadn’t played music. Paul recalled, “I wasn’t motivated by having a fabulous group. I was motivated by not wanting to leave my wife behind. We had only just married. What was I going to do, run off on the road? The Beatles weren’t very good when they started out either.” He had the pick of prime studio players, recruiting New York drummer Denny Seiwell after he played on Ram, the 1971 album credited to Paul and Linda McCartney, but he found his true lieutenant in Denny Laine, a guitarist who sang lead on the Moody Blues’ breakthrough hit, “Go Now,” in 1964 but spent the subsequent decade struggling to maintain a living as a working musician.Laine shared a history with McCartney and also recognized his subordinate role. He later said, “Let’s be honest—[McCartney] wanted to be in a band in a sense, but he would still have the final call.” McCartney overshadowed the rest of Wings to the extent that their records were essentially treated as Paul’s creation: Jon Landau’s Rolling Stone rave of Band on the Run didn’t mention Denny Laine’s name once.",Rock,9.0
472,"The latest album from the Washington, D.C.-based band led by songwriter and critic Elizabeth Nelson is smart, sturdy, reference-rich rock. The Interrogator is an ideal title for an album by Elizabeth Nelson’s hyper-literate band, the Paranoid Style.

474,"The Brazilian guitarist and L.A. saxophonist’s collaboration is charming and intimate. The pair coils themselves around these songs, prioritizing rhythmic complexity and sheer prettiness over far-out exploration. Like Billy Corgan with a Big Muff or Jimi Hendrix with a Crybaby, L.A. saxophonist Sam Gendel long ago figured out how to turn a commercial piece of hardware into something personal and immediate. In his case, it’s a battery of reverb, synth emulators, and effects pedals that, when he’s at his most dialed-in, can make his horn sound like both Rahsaan Roland Kirk on “The Inflated Tear” and Tom Morello on “Killing in the Name.” It’s a discombobulating sound that’s become ubiquitous in the L.A. jazz and experimental scenes over the past decade. Listen to a handful of songs he’s been on and you’ll know it instantly: Like backmasked speech, it feels both inside-out and strangely familiar.It’s simply strange, then, to hear a Sam Gendel record in which the saxophone sounds familiar. There are no effects on The Room, his new duo album with seven-string guitarist Fabiano do Nascimento. There’s no percussion, either—save for a bit of breath-scatting Gendel puffs through his horn in the lovely “Astral Flowers”—or any of the bleary production effects that can make Gendel’s records sound like they were recorded by the light of an old desktop monitor. Nascimento’s recent albums—2023’s Das Nuvens and Mundo Solo—is dotted with drum machines and bushy synths, but he’s long taken his cues from the crisp and tidy jazz of ECM and the close-mic’d sambas of João Gilberto. This can make his music feel a touch formal at times, almost uncannily precise, but just as it does on 2017’s Tempo dos Mestres, that production style gives The Room a clarity that allows the listener to focus on how deftly both musicians move across the album. Like a World Cup telecast, even the slowest moments of these performances deserve to be seen in the highest possible definition.Nascimento and Gendel’s rapport was obvious on the five Tempo dos Mestres songs they recorded together, and they bonded further over a shared love of Brazilian guitarist Baden Powell and the 1964 Stan Getz and João Gilberto smash Getz/Gilberto. While that album also brought together an American saxophonist and a Brazilian guitarist, it’s Gendel whose playing more closely recalls that of Gilberto. In a reedy tone that sounds nearly as much like a flute as it does a sax, he flies close to the ground, sometimes barely blowing above a whisper; when the end of “Foi Boto” calls for greater intensity, he gets it by playing quieter. Gendel can write a gorgeous, aching melody—that’s him at the tender core of Sam Wilkes’ “Run,” for one—but hearing him play it straight across an entire album is a very welcome reminder of the depth and delicacy that’s sometimes obscured by his effects.",Jazz,7.7

477,"On what is billed as his final studio album, the late reggae legend is treated as an afterthought, buried in the mix beneath an incongruous blend of electronic styles. Late dub reggae godhead Lee “Scratch” Perry flung his creative moon dust so far and wide over six decades of music-making that pinning him down is impossible. King Perry, a posthumous entry in a discography that numbers hundreds of recordings, and apparently his final work, does little to untangle the thorny knot of Perry’s genius as producer, songwriter, singer, and musical mystic. But it does serve as a reminder—albeit a rather muted one—of Perry’s late popularity as a guest vocalist, a position he embraced on records by everyone from the Beastie Boys to the Orb.King Perry is, in name, a Lee “Scratch” Perry solo record. But the album’s brash electronic instrumentation, from Grammy-nominated producer Daniel Boyle and Bristol maverick Tricky, have the unfortunate effect of making Perry feel like a guest on his own record, his voice often buried low in the mix, where it battles in vain against ear-rinsing sonics.Perry was always open to new music, be it punk in the 1970s or ambient house in the 2000s. But King Perry’s experiments in blending reggae with electronica, breakbeats, and pumping 4/4 beats ring a little false. On “Jesus Life,” Perry’s gentle chitchat sounds lost and unloved amid an ominous electronic bass line, drum machine thud and (uncredited) Tricky guest vocal, a strand of saffron thrown into an unforgivingly thick musical stew.“Green Banana” takes a further step backward, making both Perry and Happy Mondays’ Shaun Ryder—a potentially inspired vocal pairing—sound like they’ve wandered into the wrong studio, where some young punk is laying down acidic breakbeats. A lot of the album’s production, for all its genre-bending, is dull, and it doesn’t help that Perry’s vocals are borderline unintelligible, his gentle croak unable to compete against the studio noise.This, more than anything, is King Perry’s downfall. Scratch may be best known as a producer—for Bob Marley, the Congos and the Clash, to name but three. But he was also an enchanting vocalist, his magical tone imparting a wistful melancholy on later albums like 2019’s Rainford. This, perhaps, could have been the case here. Perry’s vocal on “Goodbye,” apparently the last song he recorded, should be an emotional shoo-in. But its impact is deadened when overlaid with a prominent drum beat and humming synth line. There’s a fond farewell in there somewhere, but you have to strain like hell to hear it.King Perry rings with the call of missed opportunity. Boyle did a decent retrogressive production job on Perry’s 2014 album Back on the Controls, and King Perry contains the germ of what could have been achieved by surrounding Scratch with modern production and guest vocalists. “100lbs of Summer” is a green shoot of summer-blushed pop reggae, thanks to a mournful horn line, rolling bass, and what sounds like genuine chemistry between Perry and London singer GreenTea Peng. That congenial feeling extends to Peng’s other appearance on the album, “Jah People in Blue Sky,” a sprawling, but very charming, digi-dub number with an ear-worm chorus and genuine momentum, while the guest-free “King of the Animals” locks into a satisfyingly hypnotic reggae groove that actually leaves some space for Perry to freestyle over.",Experimental,5.9
478,"The New Zealand band’s debut is heavy but nimble, with the tight interplay of an old-fashioned indie rock power trio. When the New Zealand singer-songwriter Kane Strang got tired of going it alone as a solo artist, he started an old-fashioned indie rock power trio called Office Dog. Backing him up are two friends from different iterations of his touring band: bassist Rassani Tolovaa and drummer Mitchell Innes. Like Dinosaur Jr., Sebadoh, and Built to Spill, this threesome emphasizes the personality of each player as it wrings maximum drama from a minimum of instruments. Tolovaa interjects unexpectedly melodic counterparts, Innes drags the songs in odd directions, and Strang favors low, dissonant guitar notes that often sound like an animal scurrying through underbrush. Rather than abrupt or violent, their quiet-loud dynamics are measured, even eloquent, such that Spiel, their debut, sounds like an album about the joy of playing together.Recorded in Auckland with producer De Stevens (best known from the Dunedin band Marlin’s Dreaming), Spiel wanders some of the same terrain Strang has mapped in his solo work. Too young to have experienced the initial wave of New Zealand indie pop firsthand, he always sounded a little more self-consciously clever, a little less enamored with earworms than the other Flying Nun bands to which he was constantly compared. (Spiel was released on that label last year before getting an international release via New West this year.) But he’s still interested in the way a grinding, slightly dissonant guitar can kick up some dust and how a monotone delivery can make even slightly melodic passages sound almost ecstatic by contrast.With Office Dog, however, Strang is more than willing to cede control to his bandmates. Spiel is heavy but nimble, more direct in its arrangements and sentiments, but also moodier, more melancholy; it sounds like shoulders shrugged against a cold wind. While he does craft some intriguingly askew hooks—slicing the word “shade” into multiple syllables, clipping his words into a staccato rhythm on “Tightropes”—Strang pares his songwriting back considerably, deploying just a few words to gesture toward feelings that resist specific labels. Just as the music toggles between quiet and loud, these songs move from alienation to contentment, from unease to “something like an antidote.” That tight interplay between the three musicians sounds so disarmingly poignant because at heart this album is about recognizing and savoring even the smallest moments of joy.It’s odd, then, to hear Strang close out the album with an apology. “Sorry for the spiel,” he sings as the trio’s dense rumble fades and some tentative guitar licks emerge. “I just wanna feel real.” It’s a meta moment that might have sounded too clever for what precedes it—like a wink at the notion of the indie rock album as a therapy session. But what comes through isn’t self-absorption but something much closer to gratitude. These are songs that catalog small moments and simple pleasures, like a friend’s smile that “feels like heaven to me” or the warmth of “sunshine on your face.” Or maybe it’s just the modest pleasure of bass, drums, and guitar each clicking into place.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

479,"The jazz trio’s follow-up to 2021’s Uneasy is irresistibly listenable, an immersive 66 minutes that exhales a particular aesthetic history even as it pulls on the pain and anxiety of our present. Few pianists vary a theme better than Vijay Iyer, whose new album Compassion, with bassist Linda May Han Oh and drummer Tyshawn Sorey, flows with the smooth, pathfinding quality of shallow water in a rocky stream. The 52-year-old’s fingers worry over melody: He reconsiders, restates, and repeats phrases as though he hasn’t quite made himself clear. What does Iyer need to tell us so urgently? Motion itself is the message, how life barrels forth during periods of unimaginable struggle.Iyer’s overpowering voice on the piano means that he takes center stage even when he tries not to—such as on his searing, topical post-9/11 collaboration with experimental rapper Mike Ladd, In What Language? The gravitational pull of his keys sometimes evokes Keith Jarrett, who similarly occupies the spotlight while sharing billing with fellow musical titans. And both pianists have track records with ECM, a long-time hub for jazz and contemporary classical marked by a fluid, pristine, often fusion-friendly aesthetic. Compassion is Iyer’s most characteristic release since he started recording for the German label more than a decade ago: The album is irresistibly listenable, an immersive 66 minutes that exhales a particular aesthetic history even as it pulls on the pain and anxiety of our present.The album eschews the electronics of his phenomenal ECM debut as leader, 2013’s Mutations, and the tabla that lifted the deft interplay of 20ll’s Tirtha beyond blinkered American custom. Working with just three instruments, Compassion feels like the most sweeping outing of his oeuvre, stretching the hookier moments of this combo’s much-lauded 2021 inauguration Uneasy into extended meditations and relentless workouts. The trio’s take on Geri Allen’s “Drummer’s Song” reappears here as not only a fantastic closer, but also a barometer for their ongoing growth. Uneasy stripped the cheeky maximalism of the late pianist’s initial arrangement to essentials, while Compassion blurs the song at its edges, letting it bleed into the band’s take on a composition by beloved saxophonist John Stubblefield. Compassion is widescreen in both emotion and concept. Uneasy poked at news stories of the day, notably the Flint water crisis. The group’s latest paints its thematic tableau in broad strokes of sanguinity: “It Goes,” “Overjoyed,” and “Panegyric” suggest expansive, resilient sentiments that burn on in spite of the claustrophobia of moment-to-moment fear.The songs on Compassion had different genesises, but they’re in conversation, like answers to questions that Iyer has posed since his career’s start. Several of the numbers were written for an event honoring COVID victims, while others took shape as part of a project saluting poet and scholar Eve Ewing, whose nonfiction has most famously explored the bigoted legacy of school closures in Chicago. “It Goes,” a ballad with a dreamy, singular cadence that raises a potentially slow stretch to profundity, was originally penned as a setting for lyrics that imagined Emmett Till had lived a long life—instead of being kidnapped, tortured, and lynched by Mississippi racists at the age of 14.",Jazz,8.1
480,"The North Carolina band once sounded tethered to the past. Now, more than 20 years into its career, it trades retro Americana for more expansive cinematic atmospheres. Age suits Chatham County Line, who have been anxious to act older than their years from the moment they picked up stringed instruments. Founded in Raleigh, North Carolina, in 1999, they once sounded like they might have been emissaries of a much earlier era, but with the passage of time, they’ve become less tethered to the past while expanding their vision of what Americana could be. After feinting toward heartland rock on 2020’s Strange Fascination, Chatham County Line turn moodier on Hiyo.CCL vocalist/guitarist Dave Wilson co-produced the album with producer and music supervisor Rachel Moore, who in 2022 enlisted the group to serve as backing musicians on the set of George & Tammy, a Showtime series dramatizing the legacy of country icons George Jones and Tammy Wynette. Once filming was complete, Wilson returned the favor by convincing Moore to join the group in the studio. The album they created together feels appropriately cinematic, drifting from bluegrass picking and plaintive harmonies into territory where such distinctions cease to matter.Chatham County Line still emphasize harmony, both vocal and instrumental, yet they appear newly eager to discover what lies beyond the borders of bluegrass. They place their emphasis neither on songs or fingerpicking, two cornerstones of the genre, but on atmosphere. Moore’s subtle use of studio effects gives Hiyo an almost painterly grain. The players ride meditative, melancholy chords that ebb and flow, reaching a pinnacle on the soft pulse of “Heaven,” which spends as much time receding as it does creeping ashore.The desire to experiment occasionally leads them astray; Wilson’s writing on “Lone Ranger” gets bogged down in bedroom power dynamics. They’re better served by a lighter touch, like when they preserve the gendered lyrics in a haunted version of Patsy Cline’s “She’s Got You.” The Cline cover is one of a handful of retro accents on Hiyo—the closing “Summerline” features Wilson crooning into a phased old-timey microphone—but Chatham County Line have never seemed less burdened by the past. They embrace electronics and melodies sweet enough to be classified as pop—on “Magic,” they do so simultaneously—and discover new spectral microtones lying within their combined voices. These impressionistic textures place the album in a netherworld that’s untethered from any specific time or place. There’s an unquantifiable restlessness at the heart of Hiyo that keeps the record just out of reach, hinting at territories both alien yet oddly comforting.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

481,"The Nashville singer-songwriter’s second album is a deft and subtly surprising inquiry into romantic illusion. Nashville native Katy Kirby initiated her second album as a songwriting experiment—directing swooningly lovely country songs to an imagined female lover. Funny the things music can tell us about ourselves. Shortly after writing Blue Raspberry’s title track, Kirby entered her first queer relationship. The finished album is a thoroughly lived-in document of a complicated romance: no longer genre exercise in yearning but a philosophical inquiry into it.On Blue Raspberry—which takes its name from an artificially flavored gas-station drink—Kirby positions her songs in between artifice and reality, dissecting the ruses, contrivances, and willful hallucinations that sustain romantic fantasy. She studs the album with suitably unsubtle metaphors: fake diamonds, glitter, candy. At first, the songs sound as unthinkingly lovely as anything within the “sapphic yearning” strain of indie pop (think Clairo or girl in red). Repeat listens reveal a more jagged and complex version of intimacy, one replete with well-navigated confusion and contradictions.As a lyricist, Kirby is inventive and exhilarating, though she occasionally overwrites. Though each line on Blue Raspberry overflows with excellent, original ideas, she tends to pile them high rather than give them the breathing room they deserve. “You’re the prettiest mermaid in the souvenir shop/But if you’re coming home this late, you know you’d better be drunk,” she sings on “Cubic Zirconia,” allowing what should have been a hard-hitting rejoinder to fall flat.The songs themselves are soft and sauntering, built around close-mic’d guitar and piano and occasionally offset with strange, barely perceptible flourishes that evoke subtle unease. On “Hand to Hand,” a high, quiet chirp rings out like a fire alarm in heaven. On “Fences,” Kirby plays guitar as though she’s gently chucking it for wood. Throughout, she sustains a near-whisper, like she’s singing to a lover underneath a quilt. Her light-as-air melodicism helps take the weight off the more verbose lyrics.Kirby’s best writing shows off her talent for contracting abstract ideas into the kinds of pithy lines that inspire furious underlining. She describes romance as “diminutive contrition”; falling in love “a carpet bomb of estrogen.” Her ability to give clarity to chaotic, contradictory forces sets her apart. She holds a poetic fascination with metaphorical fences, for instance; the ways in which they both excite and evade intimacy. “Good neighbors make good fences,” she sings on “Wait Listen.” It’s a heady reversal, rendered so tersely as to obscure the brainwork behind it. Blue Raspberry proves that Kirby is particularly dialed in on these vicissitudes of intimacy. With a little fine-tuning, she could transcend.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

482,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit a groundbreaking 1996 mix from Detroit techno icon Jeff Mills, a brazen and electric performance that enshrined his reputation as the most ambitious DJ in the world. Getting onto the dancefloor of Liquidroom was always a mission. You first needed to venture to Kabukicho, the seedy edge of Shinjuku whose claustrophobic alleys and clutter of neon signage are what many think of when they picture Tokyo nightlife. From there, you’d line up around the block, trek a seven-floor staircase, pass security, elbow your way through the typically rammed 1000-cap venue, and hope whoever was playing that night was worth the cover charge. The club had hosted its fair share of notables by October 28th, 1995, but nothing on the scale of what went down that Saturday night. Because whether you were pressed against the stage or posted up at the bar, as soon as the clock struck 3 a.m. and Detroit’s Jeff Mills cued up his first record, you bore witness to the future.Sixty-eight minutes and 38 songs chiseled out of that three-hour DJ set became Mills’ first commercially accessible mix, Live at the Liquid Room, Tokyo. No real-time video of the performance exists, nor can you access the audio on any streaming service, but scan the comment sections under dozens of unofficial uploads or spend enough time in the danker corners of club smoking areas, and you’ll crash headlong into a wall of consensus that this is a mix without equal, the Techno Bible, unequivocally The One. You can ask ChatGPT right now what the greatest DJ mix of all time is, and it’ll hedge on the amorphous nature of subjectivity, then list Liquid Room top anyway.Released in spring 1996, Liquid Room was a mix of such molten intensity that it warped the idea of what DJing could be. The received wisdom of how to construct a club set—one song after another; build-up, breakdown—was obliterated by this lean, striking man mixing like a Spirograph, executing a blur of hip-hop battle techniques over waves of crushing pressure. Records were piped in hot with phased doubles, scratches, stabs, rewinds, inverted frequencies, and hard stops, then torn from the platter without warning and discarded onto the floor, until you couldn’t be certain if this was dance music or a new frontier in free jazz.A detail still broadly unknown is that Mills wasn’t even using his preferred setup of three turntables: In order to demo unreleased cuts within the mix, he was operating on two turntables and two reel-to-reel tape machines, which upped the difficulty level appreciably. It didn’t hurt that one of those quarter-inch tapes was built around a four-note call-and-response between a higher and lower rung of bells, a quirky splash of chiaroscuro in otherwise total darkness. Bouncing around like a hacky sack off the steel-capped toes of two established Midwest bangers, Mills’ “Life Cycle” and DJ Funk’s “Work That Body,” the track was listed only in the liner notes as “Untitled A.” We know it today as “The Bells,” a stone-cold anthem.",Electronic,10
483,"The Baltimore band’s latest is another emotional tour de force that tests the limits of their long-running sound. By the time Future Islands scored their first hit, they were already four albums into their career. It’s been nearly a decade to the day since their viral performance of “Seasons (Waiting on You)” on The David Letterman Show, a milestone that was hardly a starting point for the band: “I was actually holding back,” singer and lyricist Samuel T. Herring has said of his rousing stage demeanor during the show. “That’s what was going on in my head—don’t go too far.” The implication there is that some part of him knew he’d have the chance to go further.“If I said too much, please let me know,” Herring sings on “The Thief,” a sparkling highlight from Future Islands’ new album People Who Aren’t There Anymore. It’s a jarring sentiment to hear from someone who proudly dances like everyone’s watching, who usually has so much to say that he moonlights as a rapper. And though the Baltimore band has hardly drifted from their new wave-filtered synth-pop in the past decade, People makes it clear that things have changed.The album largely revolves around Herring’s breakup with a long-term, long-distance partner, with whom he used to spend the bulk of his time in her native Sweden. Travel restrictions during the height of the pandemic meant the pair were often apart for months at a time, though it wasn’t until after Herring began writing People that they decided to split for good, meaning these 12 tracks follow Herring’s heartbreak in real time. During the album’s first half, he ponders sending messages in bottles across the ocean, counts the days until he gets to board his next plane to Sweden, and mulls over the agony of having to text his partner “good morning” just before he falls asleep—a seemingly innocuous interaction that only amplifies the physical distance between them.Herring has sung about grief, heartbreak, and disappointment several albums over now, and though the events that underscore People have surely impacted him—“Regret and fear have an appetite,” he laments on the up-tempo dance number “Give Me the Ghost Back”—it feels at times that he’s running out of ways to evoke his strifes, his passionate yowls lessened by his clichés. His imagery on the punchy album opener “King of Sweden” is hampered by weak rhymes like “I’m always flyin’/So I’m always cryin’” and sentiments of feeling 15 years old again. The funky, bass-thumping “Say Goodbye” harps on the logistical difficulties of connection across time zones, as Herring measures past time by how many cigarettes he’s smoked.",Rock,6.6
484,"On his fourth studio album, the Louisiana rapper chills out, finds some inner peace, and sticks to the middle of the road. Picture it: Kevin Gates cuddles a miniature bulldog before strolling past an exotic car collection and stepping into an elevator. Two floors up, the doors open to a Beyoncé concert, and Gates has a ticket. As Adderall meets alcohol, the Baton Rouge rapper leans into the giddy delirium, tearing off his shirt and singing with the crowd, lyrics be damned. The vivid celebration scene Gates conjures on “Yonce Freestyle,” a single from his new album The Ceremony, hovers as high as his most infamous performance photo. So why does the record sound so firmly rooted to the ground?The different failures to launch across these 17 songs are, in part, an unfortunate consequence of an even keel. Anguish has been a key force stringing together Gates’ weathered bleeding-heart blend of Dirty South beats and unflinching “up-North” lyrics. But grizzled street raps aren’t standard on The Ceremony. Before the lyre-textured album opener unfurls, Gates ad-libs “Real medicine music.” The theme here is indeed healing: through reflection, redemption, and plenty of makeup sex. Phone calls from old off-the-porch contacts ring in his ears as a symphony of birdsong (“Birds Calling”). Sometimes, things get a little hokey. On the cut actually titled “Healing,” Gates is proudly “doing yoga and attracting my twin flame through meditation.” Elsewhere, he cleanses his Mercedes Benz with sage (“God Slippers”).Well-documented goofiness aside, Gates never aspired to be a meme rapper, and he’s spoken about developing a signature poring over Tupac, Nas, and JAY-Z. Fellow Louisiana gentleman Lil Wayne eventually plucked Gates from a prolific mixtape run to be a bubble player on Wayne’s YMCMB roster, but Gates never popped. After he cultivated an underground following on his label Bread Winners’ Association, Atlantic caught up. Gates had already been mining Taylor Swift melodies for needle drops. His mainstream crossover felt destined, despite the turbulence of his early career.But over a decade since inking a big-time deal that almost immediately lost momentum due to a devastatingly timed prison sentence, which he addresses on “Letter 2 My Fans,” Gates sounds weary of radio rap. He’s a hall-of-famer as far as major-label debuts go—2016’s Islah exemplifies the spoils of corporatization with minimal compromise in every belted hook. But where a more polished, pop-minded sound was jet fuel for Gates there, it’s quicksand on The Ceremony. The writing is all about moving forward, but the sonics keep Gates frozen in time, fused to an outdated Hot 100 sound that’s incongruous with his matured, quieter stylings.",Rap,6.7
485,"Performing with her jazz ensemble, the New York guitarist makes music that hangs in the balance between composition and improvisation, structure and dissolution. Mary Halvorson’s guitar tone contains within it a microcosm of her entire practice as a composer and bandleader. She gives the impression, through her ingenious use of a particular delay pedal, that her instrument is inhabiting two states of matter at once, or making an imperceptibly slow transit between them: now dry and unadorned, definitively guitarlike, almost uncanny in its naturalism; now liquidy and unstable, with digital processing freeing every static pitch from whatever invisible forces are holding it in place. Sometimes, you get one state or the other, but mostly you get both. Each note takes on the character of an ice cube left out a little too long, glistening solidly in the material of its own dissolution.Cloudward, the MacArthur-winning New York jazz musician’s latest album, is also like a document of edges melting away. Halvorson composed the music for Amaryllis, the ensemble she first assembled for her 2022 album of the same name: Patricia Brennan on vibraphone, Nick Dunston on bass, Tomas Fujiwara on drums, Jacob Garchik on trombone, and Adam O’Farrill on trumpet. (Laurie Anderson also appears for a scraped-violin cameo on the clamorous “Incarnadine.”) In “The Tower,” dramatic chord changes give way to atonal free improvisation so gradually as to obscure the differences between the two modes. And from pools of amorphous improv arise moments of surprising order: Two instruments might converge suddenly in a shared melodic line, or slyly imitate each other’s articulation, then nonchalantly diverge again. Of course, nearly all jazz carries some tension between compositional rigor and expressive freedom. But Halvorson is unusually attuned to the porousness of these putative borders. Though I can’t help but wonder whether certain fragments of structure were outlined in advance or created spontaneously by the players, such questions of category may be the wrong ones to ask of music so preoccupied with the liminal moment of becoming.Halvorson puts her idiosyncratic instrumentation to good use on Cloudward. Brennan’s vibraphone and Garchick’s trombone are particularly well suited to the album’s dissolving sensibility: the former with its pointed percussive attack and flickering sustained resonance; the latter with its sliding articulations of each note. For a jazz guitar album, it contains few guitar solos, a dynamic that only serves to emphasize the holism of Halvorson’s playing and composing. The sonorities of her collaborators’ entwined voices so thoroughly reflect her own that she can recede to the background for extended stretches without compromising the music’s identity.One notable exception is “Desiderata,” the album’s most rock-oriented piece, across whose middle section Halvorson explodes with a solo that begins like a buzzsaw and ends like a supercomputer going haywire. On a record whose every moment is so delicately balanced, it is a rare and exhilarating passage in which wild abandon decidedly wins out over careful control. Likewise, “Unscrolling” reaches its climax with an arco bass solo that nearly abandons pitch entirely in favor of the tactile sound of bow on strings. Dunston’s playing is powerful, but the solo’s impact owes as much to Halvorson’s instinct for the deliberate arrangement of passages that other out-jazz bandleaders might leave to the intuition of the moment. Just as Dunston is reaching a peak of feverish intensity, rather than rise to meet him as many improvisers would, the accompanists abruptly drop out, leaving him to howl alone.",Jazz,7.8
486,"With regal harp strings, droning synths, and kinked guitar lines, the Los Angeles multi-instrumentalist’s full-length debut establishes her as a loose but imaginative composer. Nailah Hunter angles her compositions toward the spiritual realm. A pastor’s daughter, she once said that her upbringing left her with a “​​residue of Christian faith,” but her music draws more upon the tenets of astrology and mysticism. The Los Angeles-based artist was singing in choir when a harpist joined their performance one year; she was transfixed by the instrument’s ethereal tones and regal beauty (“Even in the way that it looks, the crown is pointed to the heavens,” she said in an interview with KEXP). As a harpist for sound baths and meditation sessions, Hunter’s relationship with the instrument has not only shaped the way she composes, but how she approaches the tedium of daily life; she is a firm believer that the frequencies emanating from the harp have healing properties.Hunter’s six-song EP Spells, released in 2020, was written to conjure reflection and tranquility, twisting elements of ambient, experimental, and new age into gilded strands. For her debut full-length Lovegaze, the musician sketched out songs on a borrowed Celtic harp in a small city on the southern coast of England, later enlisting London producer Cicely Goulder to sharpen and shine their edges. Across the 40-minute album, Hunter emerges as a dexterous player and loose but imaginative composer. Rather than succumbing to the often corny tropes of new age music—mawkish melodies, pan flutes, chimes—she cleverly incorporates elements of contemporary R&B, pop, and jazz.“Through the Din,” with its looped and layered vocals, circular beat, and icy synth tremors, recalls early Portishead, while Hunter’s falsetto glimmers through its moody ambiance, like headlights cutting through fog. Goulder fleshes out the song, supplying strangeness and complexity with a cascade of piano keys that ground Hunter’s skyward harp. Hunter could easily play it safe, swaddling the listener in major scales and good vibes, but Lovegaze suggests she’s interested in augmenting form and genre.Hunter’s compositions are spacious and dynamic, fine-tuned with Goulder’s meticulous production choices. She handles every plucked harp string, every silken filament of Hunter’s voice, with the utmost delicacy. On the title track, Hunter and Goulder fuse baroque balladry with abstract jazz, smearing Hunter’s harp chords and stacked harmonies with reverb and letting crisp snare rhythms snap at the surface. The off-kilter details—kinked guitar lines, askew trills of alto flute—contrast Hunter’s willowy voice, accenting its elegance without overwhelming it.Hunter is even more restrained on the album’s second half, which includes “Cloudbreath,” an iridescent, rippling instrumental of harp, flute, and synthesizer. The pared-back arrangement and production on pieces like “Bleed” and “Adorned” draws the ear to Hunter’s subtle yet evocative lyrics. On the latter, Hunter drapes her voice over droning, organ-like synths and sleek ribbons of saxophone. “Far from remorse/It’s the pain you adorn,” she sings. Her efficient phrasing positions psychic wounds as medals, or all-new limbs to tend to. Singing the line “pain you adorn” repeatedly, Hunter gestures at our compulsion to feed personal suffering with constant, damaging attention.Dark little crevices, tucked into the calming expanses of Lovegaze, add a lyrical complexity that’s missing from the album’s first half. The finest example is the spare and intriguing “Into the Sun.” Part medieval dirge, part demented nursery rhyme, the song is stretched across a scaffolding of harp plucks and Hunter’s earthiest register. “I dream of beheadings/And goose feather bedding on fire,” she sings, climbing from a crackling low to a gauzy falsetto. “A sword through the eye/For an endless supply of beginnings.” The arcane, violent imagery bristles against Hunter’s sparkling strings, forging instant tension and intrigue. In these vivid passages, Hunter endures the pangs of change in order to transcend her pain, luminous and unburdened.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

487,"Like its 2018 predecessor, J Mascis’ fourth solo album plays a little like Dinosaur Jr. Jr., another softer guitar-focused outing with acoustic touches and electric sparks. These days, the most surprising thing about J Mascis’ solo albums is how regular they’ve become. When Mascis released Several Shades of Why in 2011, a quarter-century into his career, it was an anomaly—his first solo record of original material and an acoustic showcase for some of his most vulnerable songwriting. Ever since, he’s made it a regular habit, chasing each new Dinosaur Jr. album with a mellower, more leisurely solo record a couple of years later, as if part of some creative detox ritual. Since the original Dino Jr. lineup launched its improbably long, drama-free reunion, they’ve committed to, if not a healthier diet of communication and compromise, at least a shared understanding of their strengths, with Mascis writing to the terse sensibilities of his bandmates Lou Barlow and Murph. That’s led to some excellent records—five of them in a row, an incredible streak—but it’s also limited most of the shaggy exploration that Mascis brought to the band when he ran it as a de facto solo project in the ’90s and freely granted himself the right to indulge in gaudy funk or throw in a trumpet. Like 2018 predecessor Elastic Days, Mascis’ fourth solo album, What Do We Do Now, plays like a traditional band album, albeit in a decibel range considerably lower than Dinosaur Jr.’s skyscraper amp towers. Acoustic rhythm guitars ground the record with a bright shimmer, and Mascis accompanies them with a full drum kit, keyboards from Ken Maiuri (a fellow Massachusetts native and current member of the B-52’s), and, most unmistakably, the searing electric guitar solos that he pointedly left off of his first couple of solo records. Those wailing, emotive guitars remain one of the most expressive instruments in indie rock, but their impact is dulled when they’re unrooted from Dinosaur Jr.’s default volume and propulsion. The first time they torpedo through opener “Can’t Believe We’re Here,” jolting the track to life, the effect is undeniable. When they repeat the maneuver on every song, almost always at the midway point, the thrill wears off. Mascis’ best solos exude spontaneity. These feel more like muscle memory.To the extent What Do We Do Now is less satisfying than Mascis’ previous solo releases, it’s because it has less to reveal. Mascis has written so many songs about the same needs and frustrations—his failures to communicate, to be understood, and ultimately accepted—that they can’t help but bleed together. Still, the album’s light touch and content disposition make it a very easy listen, especially when Mascis leans into tenderness. On the title track, he sings about longing to kiss and squeeze you, a line that might scan as barbed amid the tension and murk of a Dinosaur Jr. song. Here it’s just another pleasant thought on an album whose instincts are always for familiar comforts.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

488,"Numero Group’s deluxe 5xLP box set looks back on a cult band that forged an unconventional blend of math rock and post-hardcore in the early 2000s. Career retrospectives tend to coincide with a period in which their subjects have become newly influential or relevant, or a moment when shifting tastes have made them ripe for rediscovery. That’s not the case with 90 Day Men, the Chicago art rockers whose three albums drew from turn-of-the-century underground rock’s most obscure corners, and sound even more arcane two decades later. Nothing in the air suggests the time is right for a 90 Day Men reappraisal; you’d be hard pressed to find a contemporary band that cites them as an inspiration. Perhaps the best argument for Numero Group releasing a career box set now is that there might never be a right time.Numero’s 5xLP set We Blame Chicago compiles all the group’s studio albums, along with singles, EPs, and unreleased material, chronicling 90 Day Men’s evolution from a math-rock band straining for originality into a jazzier, more cryptic outfit that eventually found it. For all its promise, their 2000 debut album (Is (It) Is) Critical Band couldn’t quite crack the puzzle of finding coherent common ground between math rock, modernist post-hardcore, and jagged post-punk. The band’s most avant hallmarks were there from the beginning—long, digressive songs; whiplash turns; almost free-form instrumental interplay—but the presentation was off. An air of artifice hangs over the record, especially the performances of singer Brian Case, who sang mostly in either a hectoring torrent of exclamations (“This is from one primadonna to another!”) or in droll spoken monologues. Even by the standards of music that never cared much about likability, he could be a gratingly confrontational frontman, either so overbearing he was barely tolerable or so checked out he was barely there. It didn’t help, either, that the album’s central pairing of sardonic post-punk a la Gang of Four and the Fall and stern, serious Louisville-style math rock clashed on a conceptual level. Even on a song that grappled with the dichotomies of seeking and knowing, faith and uncertainty, “Exploration vs. Solution, Baby,” the glibness is right there in the title, like a shrug emoji saying, “Take this seriously, or don’t.” You’d imagine Slint’s Spiderland would lose something, too, if that album broke its unflinching intensity every couple of minutes to tell you it was just pulling your leg.To 90 Day Men’s credit, they course-corrected quickly. By their 2002 follow-up, To Everybody, their first album written entirely after their relocation from St. Louis to Chicago, they’d landed on a far richer, much more singular muse. The instrumental “We Blame Chicago” nods to the influence of their new home city on their sound, with the kind of mosaic of post-rock, jazz, and dub most commonly found on a Tortoise record. Meanwhile, keyboardist Andy Lansangan, a late addition to the group, had stepped up as a creative engine, and his stately pianos emerged as a go-to lead instrument for the group. With those pianos easing some of the demands on their frontman to command attention, Case relaxed into himself, and his vocals grew more assured, more subdued, more vulnerable.Other circumstances conspired to lend a crucial element of fragility to their sound. The group recorded in the days immediately after 9/11, when rescue crews were still scouring the wreckage for survivors, and horror and confusion remained thick in the air. In the extensive oral history that accompanies the box set, producer John Congelton recalls, “That strange nihilism everyone was feeling at the time made us like, ‘Fuck it. Let’s make a strange record.’” Congleton’s twitchy fingerprints are all over the album, most prominently in the crude, percussive tape manipulations of “Last Night a DJ Saved My Life,” the mesh of pianos and electronics that most exemplifies the album’s mournful, haunted air. It’s fascinating how a band with no apparent debt to Radiohead independently arrived at so many of the same moods and ideas as Amnesiac. The group’s final album, 2004’s Panda Park, was even more of a showcase for Congleton’s adventurous production—outside of Congleton’s own records with the Paper Chase, none of his other work from the era showcases his use of the studio quite as fearlessly. Some of the confidence and grace of To Everybody carries over, especially in the wintery ivories and beautiful despair of single “Too Late or Too Dead,” but to the extent the record isn’t as successful as its predecessor, it’s because it tries to do so much more. It’s a brief record, just 35 minutes, but with its vast busyness it feels longer. Closer “Night Birds” throws down eight and a half disorienting minutes of prog and skronk, never settling on a throughline to make its many moving parts cohere. The box set’s rare material underscores just how far this band had to climb to find its voice. A bonus cassette of the group’s earliest recordings plays like the kind of demo Dischord must have received in the mail all the time, a spirited but very raw stab at the arty post-hardcore that proliferated on the label in the late ’90s. By a 2001 John Peel session, they’d switched from an inherited language to one they seemed to be inventing on the fly, opening up their songs to breathe and highlighting the intricate dialogue between their instruments over any driving component. It’s a glimpse at what an exceptional live band they must have been at their peak. By a few years later, they were burned out. The warm reception to Panda Park opened up bigger touring opportunities, but the pressures of trying to make ends meet on the road took a toll. In the oral history, Case recalls thinking, “The only way we can live is if we’re in this fucking van all the time?” Revisiting 90 Day Men’s records with the benefit of hindsight, you can hear long-shot opportunities for them to grow their audience, if they’d wanted to compromise a bit. They could have easily leaned more into dance punk, for instance, and owned some of the Rapture/Liars market. With a little restraint and polish they could have positioned themselves as a better Cold War Kids. They also would have made an absolutely killer jam band. But in truth they never had the instincts of a group that was destined for big things. 90 Day Men were one of those bittersweet cases where their most fulfilling path was always the one with the lowest ceiling.\All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

489,"Having found unexpected happiness in her personal life, Mackenzie Scott approaches self-reflection with cautious optimism on her latest album, tentatively teasing the edges of her playful sound. What is there to mine, as a songwriter, when you’ve gotten everything you ever wanted? That’s been a central occupation of Mackenzie Scott, who performs as Torres, since her 2020 album Silver Tongue. The struggle to settle into settling down comes to the forefront on her latest record, What an Enormous Room. She approaches self-reflection with cautious optimism, the mark of someone who knows who they can fall back on when times inevitably get tough. “The dread doesn’t pay any rent money,” she observes on “I got the fear.” “But as long as it doesn’t get ahold of my honey/Think I’ll be alright.”As she’s entered her thirties, Scott has taken on a second creative life as the muse and subject of her partner, the painter Jenna Gribbon, who she married in 2022. Gribbon, whose portraits of Scott graced the covers of Silver Tongue and 2021’s Thirstier, often depicts her in scenes of domestic bliss mid-action: pulling on a robe, reading a book while slouched on a camping chair, flipping channels on the TV with no pants on. That same desire to find beauty in banality—a collection of mundane moments that build up to the larger picture—permeates the songs on What an Enormous Room. Between “months of Sundays” and morning coffee, Scott can perceive loneliness, grief, and anxiety all lurking in the wings, but none of them feel quite as vivid as “the way you hold me way too tight when we sleep.”From the glitching marching-band rhythm on Sprinter’s “Cowboy Guilt” to the lopsided ’80s pop-rock of Thirstier’s “Don’t Go Puttin Wishes in My Head,” Scott has excelled at adding a jagged, oddball edge to familiar rock structures. At its best, this album pushes further into the weird. “Life as we don’t know it,” describing a near-death experience where Scott and her stepson almost drowned, features a descending keyboard line reminiscent of the B-52’s, or a “game over” sound effect—a darkly funny representation of getting pulled underwater. (The evocative flair extends to one of Scott’s best lines to date: “Each time I looked for God, I drank a wave down every time.”) Forceful lead single “Collect” is classic Torres, pairing fuzzed-out guitar with a steadfast beat that commands attention, while opener “Happy man’s shoes” adds groovy bass and sparkling effects that turn menace into triumph. “I do not accept your shame,” Scott sings, determined as ever, now setting her sights on comfort and self-love rather than revenge.",Rock,7.0
490,"The Detroit siblings dial down the intensity of their underworld street sagas, but their latest mixtape is still packed with drama. Every Los and Nutty mixtape ascribes to the logic of Dick Wolf-produced television procedurals: You pretty much know what you’re getting every time you click play, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. The more familiar you are with the Detroit siblings’ stories of dope deals and brotherly love, the more oddly comforting their underworld sagas are. Often, their hustling chronicles are centered around the less glamorous details, the ones they usually blow by in the movies. You know, the backbreaking work necessary to make the drudgery pay off. Sleepless nights on the highway. Opening up shop in a new town and then closing it in search of greener pastures.The difference between their new project LOS X NUTTY and mixtapes of the past is the intensity. On 2020’s Panagnl4e, Vol. 2, for instance, their hellish tales of wiretaps and pit stops at motels were so vivid, it felt as if they were happening in real time. Meanwhile, LOS X NUTTY is a bit more removed; you can picture the brothers sitting on the couch in their childhood home, exchanging anecdotes and reliving the old days.The beats are a big element of the trips down memory lane; this time around, many of them are softer and smoother. They are tailor-made for jolts of nostalgia, like the gruff-voiced Los reminiscing about the rush of a high-speed chase on “Won’t Get It,” while the vocal sample gently blooms in the background. An understated funk groove is the foundation of “I Thought 10 Was Enough”; over it, Nutty, the feistier of the two, recounts memories of snapping photos with stacks of money with the wistfulness of a former high school football star looking back at the state championship game. When it’s less evocative, the lighter touch is a drag. Nutty loses some of his punchiness on “Washin My Hands,” so much so that I zoned out by the time featured guest Samuel Shabazz jumped in. “The Reason” is replete with life lessons that aren’t really that special, though they probably would have been more compelling if the dewy-eyed instrumental didn’t sound like it came from the camp of Complex.But Los and Nutty don’t stray that far from the formula that works for them; a handful of the tracks do end up capturing the grueling spirit of the Panagnl4e trilogy. None reach the heights of those mixtapes, but they’re still reliably dramatic. Take “Extorted,” which has the duo trading nerve-wracking verses over wailing sirens and barking police dogs. The pair pull out some cool tricks to give the tape extra juice; for one, Nutty sounds real inspired by the N.W.A. homage on the intro. And Los doesn’t typically rap on a beat as breezy as “Los 2 Hot,” yet the tongue-in-cheek particulars he includes in his bars only sound right coming from him: “White people even at the truck stops love me.” He also revives Lil Onion—a cartoonishly high-pitched, high-strung character he introduced on his 2021 tape G, Shit Vol. 2. It’s unexpected and a little funny, the kind of idea that cleverly redraws the blueprint they hold so close.",Rap,7.1
491,"At 87, the legendary avant-garde composer revisits some of his most famous compositions with the air of a master craftsman looking back on his life’s work. In 1969, Philip Glass was performing the European premiere of a daring new piece, Two Pages, when he realized that someone from the audience had joined him at the keys and was banging away beside him, in an obvious parody of the American composer’s ultra-repetitive music. Glass, who had toughened his knuckles as a boy in Baltimore, socked the interloper in the jaw—in some accounts of the oft-told story, he kept time with the other hand—and resumed playing. It wasn’t the last time an irate audience member would try to throw a wrench in Glass’ precision-tooled musical machinery. He’s had enough eggs lobbed at him to develop opinions on which projectile is worse—raw or hard-boiled.But what a difference half a century makes. Once an enfant terrible of contemporary music, Glass, now 87, is among the most celebrated of the avant-garde’s elder statesmen, and age has clearly put him in a reflective mood. Following a spate of 75th-birthday events in 2012, he released a titanic retrospective box set in 2016 and published a smart, revealing memoir, looking back on a most unusual life in the arts: studying with the fêted French pianist Nadia Boulanger; trekking to Tibet in search of Buddhist gurus; pouring lead with sculptor Richard Serra; driving a cab until he finally made it as a composer, age 41.Glass’ new album Philip Glass Solo is similarly contemplative. It revisits some of his most famous works for keyboard, which he recorded at home—on the same piano on which he wrote many of the pieces—in 2021, while concerts were still on hold, as part of his daily practice. (Even Philip Glass apparently finds it hard to resist the seductive pull of the quarantine album.) Dozens, perhaps scores, of pianists and organists have tackled this repertoire in the studio; Glass himself has recorded all these pieces before. What stands out here is the clear impression of a master craftsman looking back on his life’s work.The album begins with “Opening,” the introduction to Glass’ 1982 album Glassworks. His debut full-length for CBS attempted to reach audiences beyond the art-world demimonde that had been coming to see his ensemble perform in downtown loft spaces; there was even a specially mixed cassette edition designed to sound better on the Sony Walkman, which had been introduced just three years before. “Opening” is not nearly as reduced or piston-like as earlier works like Two Pages or Music in Twelve Parts. To contemporary ears, its wistful modulations may sound more sentimental than minimalist. Where Glass once wrote with motorik intensity, his treatment of the polyrhythms—eighth notes in the left hand, triplets in right—ebbs and flows here, moving more fluidly than on the Glassworks recording.",Experimental,8.0
492,"After breakout beats for Kendrick and Earl, the New York producer flexes his range on a new mixtape stacked with lesser-known talent. Before Evilgiane ever made music, he was a skater. It’s how the producer’s New York-based collective Surf Gang got started: linking up under the Manhattan Bridge and sharing trick videos set to vaporwave. Since 2018, the crew has fractured and morphed, and their profile soared when Giane scored beat placements for Earl Sweatshirt and Kendrick Lamar that represented both rappers’ best releases of last year. But on his new mixtape, #HEAVENSGATE VOL. 1, he still flourishes within a posse, inviting hyper-regional talent to slide over a collection of exquisitely fine-tuned beats that position him as a superproducer in the making.Giane is used to staying focused with plenty of producers in the studio. Surf Gang’s 2021 release SGV1 packed a more robust iteration of the group onto a tape bursting with ideas while remaining loyal to a discernible vision—pattering polyrhythms held down by 808s so sleek they hit like a high diver entering the water, no splash. But he hasn’t yet tested himself on this scale, recalibrating his signature technique to a features roster the size of a summer camp soccer team. It’s a lofty task and he mostly nails it.None of the vocalists here have the name recognition of a Kendrick or an Earl, so Giane’s delicate touch is a vote of confidence. When it’s Massachusetts singer-songwriter Lucy on the track, clipped synth flares and a racing hi-hat match his chatty delivery. Atlanta’s K$upreme tests Young Thug-style ad-libs over what must be a Twilight Zone on “Lil Wayne”; Harto Falión’s dreamy laments on “Ugly Pretty” float over synth melodies that could’ve come out on Leaving Records. “Informants” casts Georgia shape-shifter and character aficionado Slimesito in a rainy nighttime neo-noir via trilling drill snares and an undulating synth like a string section bowing a mile underwater.Sometimes, Giane makes these brief, poised compositions out of extremely raw material. When Atlanta’s Bear1Boss—recognizable, in some circles, as the young man who shouted out God for booking him in the same jail as Playboi Carti in a viral clip—takes the mic on “IDK Nun,” it’s not a standout verse. But Giane’s gossamer net of chimes catches him every time he falters, draping around Bear’s yelps and whispers and bringing to mind the exquisite open space that closes another early Giane production highlight, Babyxsosa’s “Who You Love.” He doesn’t steamroll Bear’s point of view, but he doesn’t leave him out to dry among more experienced stylists either. As lovely as they get, Giane beats make good armor too.",Rap,7.3
493,"The lifelong Bohemian rubbed elbows with Salvador Dalí, Gertrude Stein, and the Rolling Stones. His 1985 avant-disco LP, featuring Lizzy Mercier Descloux and Don Cherry, finally gets reissued. By 1985, Brion Gysin had been around. Born in 1916, he ditched his native Britain for Paris in the 1930s to make it as an artist. He hung out with Dalí and the Surrealist set, whose quasi-leader André Breton kicked him out of a major group show for being friends with the likes of queer hero Gertrude Stein; as the story goes, it was Gysin who developed the marijuana fudge Stein popularized as the Alice B. Toklas Brownie in her notorious cookbook. By the 1950s, he was in Tangier with good friend William S. Burroughs. There, as another story goes, he booked the Master Musicians of Joujouka to play at his café, the 1001 Nights, and introduced them to the Rolling Stones, kickstarting pop psychedelia. Later, back in Paris with Burroughs at the notorious Beat Hotel, he systematized a new randomizing literary technique, the cut-up, and with it made sound poetry recordings that used turns of phrases like samples, a tool Bowie would utilize in his Berlin trilogy. Gysin also invented, with some help from math wiz Ian Sommerville, a device called the Dreamachine, whose patterns of flickering, stroboscopic light—produced by a perforated shade spinning around a light source—are designed, when viewed through closed eyes, to stimulate the brain’s alpha waves. It casts shadows across lighting and set designs (and stoned student dorm rooms) to this day. By the early 1980s, Gysin had traveled the world, performing and recording his hypnotic poetry on stage and on record, making paintings based on studies of Japanese and Arabic calligraphy, and generally living the cult hero life. What else could he do?Make a disco record! Gysin had taken as an assistant a high school student named Ramuntcho Matta, whose brother was the influential New York artist Gordon Matta-Clark; when Gordon died suddenly in 1978, Ramuntcho returned and spent time working in Laurie Anderson’s studio. Back in Paris by 1980, Matta culled from the city’s famed club Le Palace a who’s-who of underground disco-not-disco luminaries, including Ze records chanteuse Lizzy Mercier Descloux, along with global figures like Senegalese drummer Abdoulaye Prosper Niang and jazz legend Don Cherry. Meanwhile, years of performing his demanding, loopy poetry had turned Gysin into a kind of ideal frontperson for this kind of jittery rhythm. They all got together and made Junk, first released in 1985 on the French label Mosquito, put out on CD in 1991 by Crammed, and now reissued in all its freaky, funky glory by Wewantsounds.",Rock,8.0
494,"The Chicago industrial rap duo tears into the horrors of contemporary America over dark, glitchy beats that convey an omnipresent sense of menace. Halfway through The Legend of ABM, the new album from Chicago industrial rap duo Angry Blackmen, Quentin Branch stares down Azrael, the Angel of Death. He opens “Dead Men Tell No Lies” by growling, “Death is all around me, smell the scent in my nostrils/Grim Reaper glaring in my eyes looking hostile,” his gravelly voice cutting against a sandpapery bassline. On every song, Branch and bandmate Brian Warren confront what feels like their imminent destruction. The ambient stress of being alive in America, especially for Black men, stems from recognizing that potential harm is omnipresent: Cops have bloodshot eyes and itchy trigger fingers, drugs and alcohol course through veins and cloud vision, the weight of a rigged economy keeps us all under the thumb of the invisible hand. Angry Blackmen’s music is the sound of the unfolding apocalypse rendered in stunning 4K.Issued by stalwart Philadelphia experimental label Deathbomb Arc, The Legend of ABM shares its chaotic DNA with labelmates like clipping. and JPEGMAFIA. Derek Allen, who records dark, glitchy electronic music under the alias Formants, produced the record in its entirety, giving the songs a distorted, metallic palette. Snares sound like blades being sharpened, field recordings become smoldering drones, and kick drums hit like meteors cratering the earth. It’s brutal and harsh but always controlled. Warren and Branch first linked with Allen in 2020 after meeting at a basement show in Elmwood Park, Illinois. Allen worked with ABM on their 2020 album HEADSHOTS! and 2021 EP REALITY!, but The Legend of ABM is a full realization of their collaborative potential. Allen’s production is stripped of melody in favor of a constant oppressive atmosphere, inspiring Branch and Warren to lean further into the horrors of life under late capitalism.There’s a blunt edge to their writing, as if the lyrics were scratched into stone with a Bowie knife. They’re both unflinchingly frank, detailing their demons with disarming honesty. Self-harm and destructive behavior are constant motifs. On Branch’s solo cut, “Suicidal Tendencies,” he describes the contours of a slow-moving mental breakdown, a collapse fueled by severe alcoholism, bleak living conditions, and an unshakeable feeling that he wouldn’t make it past 27. He’s on the other side of it, having gotten sober and moved to New Mexico, but a car crash in Santa Fe that nearly killed him and his girlfriend still repeats in his mind. Warren’s solo turn on “Amor Propio” (Spanish for “self-esteem”) is equally harrowing, a journey through the day-to-day frustrations snowballing since he was a child. It culminates with a withering admission: “Kinda hard to love myself/All these years in my skin.”",Rap,7.4
495,"The garage rock auteur’s latest is a mid-career standout full of gunky riffs and tender love. The video for Ty Segall’s recent single, “Eggman,” is just a static shot of Segall, sitting at a table, eating hard-boiled eggs for four minutes straight. Around the time Segall scarfs down his eighth egg, he starts showing visible signs of fatigue, a shift reflected in the music: What starts out sounding like a pissed-off John Lennon ad-libbing a sequel to “I Am the Walrus” with Plastic Ono Band devolves into a queasy, uncomfortable dirge that feels like a blocked digestive system. By the time the song disintegrates into a murky pool of distortion, you’ll never want to eat another egg again. But Segall and wife/co-director Denée’s “Eggman” video is more than just a high-concept visualization. It’s also a spot-on advertisement for Segall’s own approach to classic-rock revisionism: He takes something that’s supposed to be a source of comfort and makes it seem kinda disgusting. And with his 15th studio album, Three Bells, he delivers some of his most immaculately constructed grotesquerie to date.While no two Ty Segall albums are totally alike, his first decade’s worth of records at least felt like they were positioned along the same psych/punk spectrum. But since dropping his definitive double-album statement, Freedom’s Goblin, in 2018, Segall has entered an exploratory phase not unlike Neil Young’s notorious 1980s period, approaching each record as a premeditated genre exercise to further dismantle his long-standing reputation as the impulsive garage rocker who can bash out three albums before breakfast. There was the anti-guitar exotica of First Taste, the synth-shocked treatments of Harmonizer, the no-frills folk of “Hello, Hi”—all illuminating additions to his multifaceted discography, but also insular, low-stakes affairs from an artist who didn’t seem all that interested in capitalizing on the momentum that Freedom’s Goblin generated. With Three Bells, however, Segall once again gives himself license to embrace randomness and surrender to sprawl. More than a status update on Segall’s ever-changing whims, it’s an ambitious, uncanny, joyously unpredictable album that invites you to get lost within its house-of-mirrors design.Three Bells’ vitality is all the more remarkable considering how easy it is to mistake it for the sort of temperate album a once-unruly rocker inevitably makes as they approach middle age. This is a record that relies on acoustic guitar as much as electric. There’s another song about his dog that’s way more chill than the last one. And when he’s not singing about life at home, he’s dropping copious references to bells and vibrations and mirrors and metaphysics, suggesting the Ty Segall of 2024 is more likely found in an occult bookshop than a basement dive. But Segall avoids slipping into the dad-rock zone because he’s still a mischievous punk at heart. He’s not pretending to be the Beatles in ’68 or Led Zeppelin in ’70—he’s imagining the music they’d make today if they were California surfer bums and skate rats just like him: “I Hear” is Bowie’s “Fashion” on a DIY budget, its disco-club bounce replaced by a grimy acoustic groove and the Frippian guitar squeals pushed into the red; “Wait” starts off on Side 1 on The White Album and ends up on Side 2 of Master of Reality.",Rock,7.8
496,"The Berlin-based musician reworks audio from vintage pornography into unrecognizable forms, queering the lineage of ambient music and subverting stereotypical representations of gay sex. Gay cruising is 90 percent patience. In bathhouses, clubs, parks, lavatories, and subway tunnels, the promiscuous loiter longer than they fuck. People swarm when activity breaks out; sometimes erotic energy spreads through these tenebrous spaces. But after a few minutes, everyone wanders around or waits, posting up against the walls while they stare at each other with an obscure mixture of indifference and excitement.The music of this ritual, heartbeat kick drums and climactic synths, is commonly associated with copulation, not minutes or hours of longing and boredom. Jake Muir captures the latter, slower reality by removing electronic music’s thumping pulse altogether. An ambient artist and field recorder, Muir grew up in Los Angeles and established his music practice in Seattle, and the sounds of water and nature that predominate in his work feel inspired by the Pacific coast and its lush, pleasant environs. Since he moved to frigid Berlin—surely a world capital of public sex—human life began to leave footprints in his glacially shifting soundscapes. His 2020 album the hum of your veiled voice delved into a night-lit queer demimonde, albeit one in which everything lascivious happens off camera. The LP animates the contemplation, shared silences, and quiet walks from DJ set to backroom bar that punctuate wee hours out on the town.Muir’s new album, Bathhouse Blues, incorporates highly processed audio clips from vintage gay pornography. This raw material offers tremendous potential for sexual explicitness. Yet Bathhouse Blues is powerful because it immerses us further in yearning and ennui, not consummation. Voices appear like the ghosts of past hookup scene habitués—a sinister image considering the title of the first track, “Cruisin’ 87,” which takes up a whole vinyl side and evokes AIDS’ deadliest years. These voices feel overheard, reverberating from across a room. Muir disfigures his audio enough that it sounds at once empty and existential, like lurking in a gay club’s maze just before sunrise, hoping for some ideal partner to round the corner.The introspective public-sex enthusiast is an underexposed cultural archetype, and Muir draws us with a librarian’s soft touch into queer history, showing how pensive figures have always flitted along the crowd’s fringes. His project focuses on a particular period, the 1970s and ’80s, in which gay directors were largely barred from telling stories about their sexual orientation in both mainstream and arthouse fare, and used the funding of the adult movie industry to bankroll cinema that was both titillating and moving, even profound. A number of the era’s gay skin flicks are considered classics today, including Arthur Bressan Jr.’s Passing Strangers (1974), much of the corpus of Wakefield Poole, and Dietrich de Velsa and Frantz Salieri’s Equation to an Unknown (1980). Others have achieved cult status among porn enthusiasts, or have yet to be uncovered in the VHS bins of the past.",Electronic,8.0
497,"Hip-hop video entrepreneur Cole Bennett directs an inevitable, overstuffed album with a lot of big-name features and little curatorial vision. You can spot a Lyrical Lemonade video before you see the bright cartoon carton in the corner. Over the past decade, 27-year-old Cole Bennett has wedged his way into the hip-hop landscape—first as a high schooler hungry for the latest releases and then, quickly, as a director who could anoint a new artist, or at least a new single, with a propulsive, technicolor video. Watch enough of his work and you’ll recognize his go-to moves: the swirl of neon as a sneaker streaks across tile, the animated jolt that brings a chain wiggling to life, the isolated words that twitch dramatically into the foreground. Bennett knows how to zero in on what’s working in a song, how to amplify the mood or emotional register that makes it compelling. With this, he’s built an empire; he reportedly turned down a $30 million offer to retain control of Lyrical Lemonade as the video production house expanded to include merch, a festival, and now, inevitably, an album: All Is Yellow.Bennett has an undeniable gift for recognizing nascent talent—his videos provided early signal boosts to rappers like Juice WRLD and Ski Mask the Slump God. In theory, he could harness that skill to power an album, to curate a dynamic tracklist that captures some distinct point of view about the sound of rap today. Instead, he stuffs 35 artists into 14 tracks, most of which feel like half-baked thought experiments. Gus Dapperton and Lil Yachty? Why not! Jack Harlow and Dave? They have zero chemistry, but hey, maybe! Sheck Wes hurls ad-libs in the background of “Fly Away” before JID shows up to rattle off melodramatic mixed metaphors: “The journey is a battle/The travel is evil/Let’s spread our wings/Fly like an eagle.” Gothboiclique’s Lil Tracy clumsily interpolates Blink-182. The total effect is cramped and frenetic and unrelenting, like a Jenga tower that collapses over and over and just keeps adding pieces to the pile.After a while, chaos becomes its own kind of consistency. But it’s hard to discern a purpose in the album’s thicket of lukewarm beats and sporadic bursts of melody. “Hummingbird” comes out of nowhere, with UMI cooing a treacly verse (“It’s been a while since I was 17 again”). Juicy J’s lecture at the end of “First Night,” a convoluted diatribe against one night stands, is even more confusing. Lil Durk’s melodic flow gets boiled down to a spangly punchline: “I’m trying to prove that I’m a star!” All Is Yellow mostly seems like an attempt to justify its own existence, as if enough high-profile features can amount to a spectacle. Sometimes it almost works; there’s a thrill in hearing Eminem’s voice right after Cordae and Juice WRLD finish rapping over his “Role Model” beat, or in the way Lil Yachty commands attention as he glides through “Fallout.” What’s conspicuously missing is Bennett’s ability to highlight these moments that make a given artist feel unique and worthy of your time; he flattens the lot, then stacks them all together.",Rap,5.1
498,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit an overlooked 1995 record from the experimental New Zealand guitarist, a psychedelic invocation of drone, noise, and the spiritual beyond. It’s a common misconception that the cult New Zealand indie label Flying Nun launched with the Clean’s 1981 single “Tally Ho!.” The Dunedin band’s debut would make sense as a shot across the bow: a jaunty, bratty organ choogle declaring “yesterday’s another day” to shake off the gray drudgery of the nation’s ’70s—of rugby, racing, and pubs teeming with cover bands. In fact, FN001 was that year’s “Ambivalence” by Christchurch trio the Pin Group, a flinty post-punk rumble about two would-be lovers each baffled by the other’s inscrutability.Unlike the Clean, the Pin Group would have made terrible ambassadors for Flying Nun, their attitude fairly summed up by the title of that first single. They refused to be photographed and struggled to convey their sound in the recording studio, even going so far as attempting to prevent copies of “Ambivalence” from getting to local reviewers, and apologizing for their sonic limitations in the sleeve to the follow-up single. By the time they released their third and final 7"", “Go to Town,” their mercurial frontman and guitarist Roy Montgomery had left to go traveling. He didn’t hear the finished product until Flying Nun sent a copy to England, where Montgomery, then in his early 20s, had sent himself on an “anti-sabbatical” to see in the flesh the acts he had only previously read about in expensively imported copies of NME.Today, we’re in the midst of a gentle Roy-naissance: Grouper has long led the charge, citing him as a key influence and releasing splits and reissues on her label. Dry Cleaning guitarist Tom Dowse cited his playing as an inspiration on the London band’s second album, and they invited him to open for them in New Zealand. He appears on harpist Mary Lattimore’s new album and is working on a collaboration with London songwriter Martha Skye Murphy. In March, his masterpiece, 1996’s Temple IV, is getting its first vinyl pressing. It was one of two solo albums recorded simultaneously and released in quick succession that would establish the wordless, pummeling thicket of sound that would become the Montgomery trademark.Back in the early ’80s, Montgomery was still trying to work out his “relationship with the ‘rock’ medium,” as he would later tell the Wire. His disaffected baritone had earned him sufficient comparisons to Ian Curtis that someone graffitied the words “ROY DIVISION” on the front of the EMI record shop where he worked, a jibe he found both funny (it lives on as his Instagram handle) and fair comment. On that trip to the UK in 1982, he became comrades with the Cure (even witnessing the recording sessions for Pornography), Echo and the Bunnymen, and the Fall, who he described as “very hospitable, even when I told [Mark E. Smith] that his favorite brew tasted like used sump oil from a Morris Minor.”",Rock,8.5
499,"In the latest soundtrack from his long partnership with director Hayao Miyazaki, the composer pares down to a minimalist palette that reflects the film’s nostalgic mood. It’s impossible to consider composer Joe Hisaishi without also thinking of his lifelong collaborator, filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki. Their creative partnership began with 1984’s Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, the film that would lead to the inception of the legendary Studio Ghibli, and they have gone on to make nearly a dozen films together. Miyazaki is known for magical realist narratives that effortlessly blend the fantastical with the everyday, and Hisaishi has created a diverse body of work to evoke the filmmaker’s imagined worlds. He complements the fast-paced thrills of Princess Mononoke with booming war anthems and conjures the sleepy seaside feeling of Kiki’s Delivery Service with gentle, breezy waltzes.For nearly 30 years, Miyazaki turned out films at a steady pace, working intensely for two years at a time and taking the next two to recuperate. Then, following 2013’s The Wind Rises, he announced his retirement—something he’d done in the past, but this time it seemed like he meant it. Inevitably, several years later, he announced that he’d begun work on a new film, The Boy and the Heron. The longer gap between productions brought changes to Miyazaki’s workflow. Where the director was once deeply involved in the process of creating music for his films, energetically pointing to storyboards as Hishaishi composed, this time he summoned his friend to the studio only once the film was almost done. After viewing the nearly completed feature, sans dialogue, Hisaishi received no instruction from the director. “I just leave it up to you,” Miyazaki said.Hisaishi chose restraint. He had done everything for Ghibli from the otherworldly electronics of Nausicaä to the triumphant symphonic sweeps of My Neighbor Totoro, but he had never explored his first musical love: classical minimalism. Inspired by artists like Steve Reich and Philip Glass, he abandoned past productions’ grandiose orchestrations in favor of piano and spare accompaniment. This intimate change, Hisaishi said recently, “would be a chance for me to move myself close to what Miyazaki had intended.”Heron is structured as two distinct chapters, and Hisaishi’s score mirrors its narrative arc. The film’s first hour, which depicts post-World War II Japan as Miyazaki remembers it, is primarily backed by Hisaishi’s piano and sparse arrangements. He plays with a stately grace on “White Wall” as the opening scenes unfold, bringing to mind the gentle lilt of Erik Satie’s Gymnopédies. When tension builds between the young boy and the titular gray heron, strings build to a sudden crest and fall away just as quickly. “A Feather in the Dusk” conveys mounting anxiety and temporary relief as man and beast lock in a standoff. The plucky strings of “Feather Fletching” bring a moment of levity before the oppressive threnody “A Trap” propels the action to its climactic turning point.",Experimental,7.8
500,"The Danish experimentalist turns toward singer-songwriter introspection, finding drama and yearning in melancholy, understated arrangements. Astrid Sonne wastes no time getting to the heavy stuff on her third album, Great Doubt. After a vanishingly brief introduction—a 61-second prelude for flute and viola that starts off sweetly and turns unsettling in its closing seconds—she cuts to the chase on “Do you wanna,” the album’s first real song. “Do you wanna have a baby?” she asks, her voice cool and affectless over lumbering piano and a plodding, rickety drum beat. Then she twists the knife: “I really don’t know.”Singing from a position of vulnerability is a shift for the Danish musician. For most of her career, Sonne avoided lyrics entirely. “I’m so awful at writing them, I would do anything to avoid it,” she told an interviewer in 2019. Instead, on her first few releases she struck an unusual balance between ambient electronics, trance arpeggios, 20th-century minimalism, and the stark, unadorned sound of her viola. On the rare occasion that she did include voices, they were just another layer of tone color. On 2018’s Human Lines, her debut, she smeared choral samples like daubs of oil paint; she closed 2019’s otherwise resolutely electronic Cliodynamics with a piece of chamber music that recalled Renaissance polyphony. On largely a cappella tracks like “Fields of Grass”—partially recorded in a parking garage—and “How Far,” the words were secondary to the songs’ whorled textures.But Great Doubt is, in many ways, a singer-songwriter record, swapping electroacoustic abstraction for plainspoken intimacy. Second-person address bleeds into first-person introspection; Sonne can be unnervingly direct. On “Do you wanna,” her great doubt turns out to be trepidation about civilization itself, her interlocutor not a lover but herself: “I think to myself/Do you wanna have a baby/Do you wanna bring people into this world?” she muses, before repeating the word “people,” rolling it around in her mouth like a foreign object.Tirzah’s hermetic brand of R&B is a clear influence on Sonne’s skeletal arrangements and carefully shaded portraits of ambivalence. On “Give my all,” the slow-moving drum programming is an uphill trudge, the strings sour and dirge-like, yet her voice—singing words borrowed from Mariah Carey—is radiant with longing, capturing lovelorn dejection with a songbird’s grace. “Almost” is similarly conflicted, filling in the outline of a breakup with a series of stark, simple images: “A woman passing by/Clouds moving across the sky/Warm rain on my face.” Her smoky alto resembles Sade Adu’s; for all the song’s inherent sadness, it’s weightless, a bittersweet nothing rendered in little more than voice and plucked strings, with a fadeout that seems to say, this too shall pass.",Electronic,7.7
501,"On the pair’s second collaborative album, the stakes of their street sagas intensify as the Detroit rapper contends with the aftermath of a traumatic car accident. In January of last year, the Detroit rapper Boldy James was involved in a car accident that left him in critical condition, with broken vertebrae in his neck and various other orthopedic injuries. When he was eventually released from the hospital, he was paralyzed from the neck down. “Screws and rods all in my shit, I couldn’t do nothin,’” he says on the outro to “Brand New Chanel Kicks,” the lead single for Penalty of Leadership, his haunting second full-length with Montreal producer Nicholas Craven. He recorded that song at his home while in a wheelchair and neck brace, barely a week after he left a physical rehabilitation center. You can hear the strain—his smooth upper baritone, usually fluid and nonchalant, sounds sleepy and stiff. But that doesn’t stop the somber magic of Boldy’s writing and the psychedelic charm of Craven’s sampled chimes; here, their morbid fairy tales are as poignant as ever.It takes a lot to humble a rapper like Boldy: The vast majority of his songs feature more close calls and dead ends than many people will see in a lifetime, but the crash seems to have jostled something loose in him. What made last year’s Fair Exchange No Robbery so special was Craven’s unvarnished loops and Boldy’s rhymes; the samples unfurled naturally before folding back into themselves like origami, while the bars—blunt and elegant as a fat pinky ring—found the sweet spot between bitter wins and triumphant losses. On Penalty of Leadership, the duo takes another step in this direction, using the grief of Boldy’s accident as a springboard for stories that are variably uplifting and unsettling.Contending with mortality always plays a crucial role in Boldy’s songs, but here, the paranoia and scars from friendships snuffed out too soon linger more than usual. Take “Evil Genius,” where he weighs the consequences of his “thug livin’” against the memories of his departed friends and his future as an artist: “Shit that they gon’ hold against me when I’m Grammy-nominated/I just wish the bro was with me; look at all the time we wasted.” The swelling accordion and raspy drums are streaked with digital echoes; the effect is as melancholy as the references to powder white enough to make snow angels. His cutthroat chronicles of his hometown—punctuated by vivid details like specific street names—are usually delivered in a cocksure monotone. Stacked alongside the trauma Boldy recently survived, his words feel even more dire.There is still plenty of business-as-usual storytelling. True to form, Boldy’s imagery is effortlessly sharp, but the unease over what he risks losing puts an asterisk on everything he does. On “Murderous Tendencies,” robberies are sandwiched between harrowing odes to lost comrades and dead perps with tongues hanging out of their mouths like Michael Jordan. Stories of moving drugs and sipping lean hit different when you have to think about how that money can get your son suspended from school (as on “No Pun Intended”) or how your daughter’s “Straight As” could be cut short by being “caught slippin’ where you don’t belong.” He’s still proud of his status among the rabble-rousers of his city, but he’s also more cautious and willing to consider how his remaining family and friends fit into the equation.",Rap,7.9
502,"The ambient power trio condenses a hard drive’s worth of marathon jam sessions into a succinct hour of cosmic minimalism and wooly post-rock. Selected Jambient Works Vol. 1 opens with the slow grace of a sunrise. A low drone shimmers into view, joined moments later by the reedy hum of a Farfisa. Synth chords billow, tinged with rich delay, pushing glittering harmonics to the edges of the stereo field. After four delicate minutes, the elements dissipate like clouds and you realize that vast expanse of tone has captured your attention without overtly commanding it. Over the next nine songs, the trio of David Moore (Bing & Ruth), Peter Silberman (The Antlers), and Nicholas Principe (Port St. Willow) repeat and refine that slow-blooming approach, composing enormous, enveloping ambient panoramas that take up the entire screen.The journey to Selected Jambient Works began in 2011, when a mutual friend introduced Moore to fellow Brooklyn musicians Silberman and Principe. All three trafficked in similar territory, occupying various overlapping points of the ambient, drone, and pop Venn diagram. They began to develop a shared musical vocabulary, recording marathon jam sessions on a handheld recorder. By 2017, all three had decamped to upstate New York, trading their cramped outer-borough neighborhoods for the wilderness of the Catskill Mountains. With Principe at the helm, the trio took the 20-plus hours of recordings they’d made between 2017 and 2021 and whittled them into a succinct 58 minutes of cosmic minimalism and wooly post-rock.These songs are huge, to be sure—Principe and Silberman’s synthesizers stretch into infinity and Moore’s transistor organs shudder like tuning forks in a silo—but the spaciousness comes from the deft restraint each musician exhibits. The band makes ample use of reverb and echo but never relies on them as a crutch to create its expansive sound. “Billings, MT” builds into a velvety groove with Principe's brushed drums galloping next to Moore’s cyclical Rhodes figure, a gauzy hum wafting in the background. Two thirds of the way through, Silberman introduces a sparse baritone guitar line, suddenly giving the track new depth. “Ten Paces” has a similar blueprint, with Silberman’s spare guitar and Moore’s Rhodes drifting through a foggy synth chord, dancing around Principe’s steady but unpredictable drum hits.Cowboy Sadness’ songs can initially feel airy and languid; their unhurried tempos and hazy atmosphere have a calm, almost heavy-lidded vibe. Yet lurking beneath the bucolic air is a slightly ominous quality, a shadow that doesn’t move with the sun. Synthetic strings slowly cocoon around the distorted melody at the center of “Full Mammoth” but allow spiky textures to peek out from the silken webbing. An anxious tremolo runs through “Starcharger,” speeding as the song presses on, gathering up blistering noise like a blade running over gravel. The band describes Selected Jambient Works as “the sound of the desert,” and the press materials mention patches of succulents, towering plateaus, and red-orange sunlight—all suitable reference points for the sweeping music found on the record. What makes Selected Jambient Works so remarkable, however, isn’t its ability to conjure images of the endless West, but rather the existential melancholy it conveys. The musicians of Cowboy Sadness understand that to grasp enormity, you must first acknowledge the smallest details; the farther you can see, they seem to suggest, the smaller you’ll feel.",Experimental,7.6
503,"Channeling jazz, kosmische, and prog, the Radiohead offshoot’s second album burrows deeper into their strangely enchanting appeal. As far back as 2009, Jonny Greenwood was fed up with the faff of the world’s most studious stadium band. “He can’t stand it anymore, the pace of the way we work,” Thom Yorke said that year. Despite the guitarist and composer’s impatience, he was prone to obsessing over what Yorke called the “extra things”: the sly strings and choked squeals that thread razor wire into Radiohead’s pillowed luxury. “‘Come on, we need some wrong notes,’ he’s always saying. OK, you got ’em,” Yorke joked.But never have we heard Greenwood quite like this. On Wall of Eyes, the second album from the Smile, his hostile harmonies and expediency in the studio nudge the trio somewhere new; it is his most exciting and volatile performance since In Rainbows. No time for their usual effortful cohesion: Producer Sam Petts-Davies resolves to stress, not conceal, the eclecticism of Yorke and Greenwood’s songs, while drummer Tom Skinner squirrels around making nests in their inhospitable time signatures. After the debut’s big bang, Wall of Eyes connects the particles into somewhere you, and perhaps these restless musicians, might like to make a home.More than anything on A Light for Attracting Attention, the Beatlesy “Friend of a Friend” and riotous “Bending Hectic” present contrasting spectacles of the Smile’s allure. The former draws inspiration from lockdown footage of Italians uniting in song on their balconies; the coda juxtaposes that pandemic solidarity against the elites’ response. “All of that money, where did it go?/In somebody’s pocket, a friend of a friend,” Yorke laments, invoking the COVID cronyism of Britain’s Conservative Party. But the tune is divine, even hummable—his deftest lunge for your heartstrings since unshelving “True Love Waits.”At the other extreme, “Bending Hectic” indulges Yorke’s time-honored passion for calamitous automobile events—in this case the last moments of a public figure, apparently disgraced, who vows to drive off the Italian mountainside. The band plays the car-crash suicide ballad as a brilliantly twisted love song: Such is the narrator’s hubris that, when an orchestral crescendo signals the plunge, and Greenwood’s lustrous string bends transmute into tire squeals, we hear the infernal crusade as a valorous final act.Across the album, Greenwood’s haywire guitars and arrangements veer between Can’s warehouse expressionism and Robert Wyatt’s alien-abducted folk fusion, conspiring with the live production and convulsive rhythms to save his bandmate from his more ponderous impulses. Yorke’s ethereal vocal register has long been his calling card and his crutch, tested to dizzying effect on the verses of “Climbing Up the Walls” before taking root on The King of Limbs. These days, he is split between warring impulses to command a song or spritz it with ghostly vapor. But even his weaker spells enchant, and Wall of Eyes opens with two irresistible slow burners: the wintry bossa nova title track, where he murmurs about digital surveillance and sedation (“You will go behind a wall of eyes/Of your own device/Is that still you with the hollow eyes?”), and “Teleharmonic,” from the “All I Need” school of fraught narrators caught in whirlpool synths, clinging to love like a life preserver.",Rock,8.5
504,"The 21-year-old singer-songwriter’s new album dilutes jangly reverb and pop-punk energy into a sound that’s chemically weather-treated for commercial appeal. Browse some of the recent profiles of 21-year-old singer-songwriter Ekkstacy, and two details appear over and over: First, his biggest song, the airy “i walk this earth all by myself,” has a lot of streams. Second, although he began his career in high school making SoundCloud emo rap, he’s now proudly an indie rocker. Neither genre translates well on his new self-titled album, one of the most assertively generic releases in recent memory. These thickly shellacked songs lack the disaffected-but-exciting undercurrent that Ekkstacy’s influences share; they also ignore the elegance of his higher vocal register, which resonated on his early self-releases. The result is a clinically impersonal record that reveals nearly nothing about the artist for which it’s named.Initially, Ekkstacy modeled his sound after the misty, arpeggiated ennui of late-2010s grunge rappers like XXXTentacion. His early releases—“the sadness in my smile” and “uncomparable”—achieve a tidy, if derivative, style reminiscent of the late Florida rapper’s 2017 album 17, while “broken/feelings 2” played with the drawn-out syllables and big hooks of predecessors like Juice WRLD and Chief Keef. A comment on one of Ekkstacy’s first SoundCloud tracks sums up the lovelorn resentment of that era of his sound: “showed him this now he play it for other bitches.”When Ekkstacy took a familiar turn from emo rap towards rock, he did some homework, dutifully embracing a Misfits-lite sound and naming a bright, uncharacteristically energetic track on his 2022 album misery after ’80s goth rock pioneers Christian Death. His latest album is a set of underpowered, faintly grungy power-pop that washes up alongside mid-aughties beach bands like Wavves or Beach Fossils. Those tentpole inspirations stand on either side of a project that seems to exist at the expense of Ekkstacy himself, a young musician whose interests have been chemically weather-treated for commercial success.At barely over 30 minutes long, EKKSTACY feels like a slog. The mood is one of vague sadness that drowns out his delicate voice both literally and figuratively. Cliché lyrics (“I don’t wanna smile/I just want to cry”) run together unconvincingly over foamy production from Deb Never collaborator Apob and the Contra Gang producer Manget$u. Their smooth touches only soften an environment that’s already desperate for some thrown elbows, out-of-nowhere synth breaks, or full-throated guitar solos.Instead, every riff is dulled down until the details bleed together like a blurred Zoom meeting background. A Trippie Redd feature on the pretty earworm “problems” barely registers. The Kid Laroi, whose polished vocals provide a minor jolt to the otherwise forgettable “alright,” fares better. But it’s nearly impossible to pinpoint specific moments of interest before they’re quelled by the anonymous room tone of the album. A song about a nondescript but beautiful girl titled “bella” is not the antidote.Ekkstacy does eke out some breathing room amid the suffocating same-old. The crashing two-part climax on “the headless horseman lost his way” achieves some gratifying catharsis on either side of its muted, bedroom-pop vocal loop. “fuck” is fun in a dopey way, probably because it involves a lot of yelling “fuck” with the occasional “yeah!” But these flashes of raw energy are swallowed by the surrounding chaff, and a jerky riff that thrilled for 20 seconds on TikTok fades into tedious wallpaper punk. EKKSTACY winds up feeling as diaristic as a cue card.",Rock,4.6
505,"Wielding the moody beats and unflinching honesty of drill music, the Brooklyn rapper takes an intimate look into the oft-unseen realities of sex work and trans survival. Voguing—at least, the style now called “old way”—was popularized through performances by gay men, like those immortalized in Madonna’s 1990 video. Vogue fem, the style predominant today, could only have been created by trans women (known as “fem queens” in ballroom, the primarily Black and Latino scene where voguing emerged). This style of dance blends fastidiously feminine gestures with dramatic storytelling and bold, athletic feats. Ms. Boogie, an Afro-Latina rapper from Brooklyn who came up in the ballroom scene, similarly fuses softness with drama on The Breakdown, wielding the unflinching honesty of Brooklyn drill to depict a life that’s uniquely her own, yet intimately familiar to other trans women.Ms. Boogie performed for years under a different name, releasing a debut album in 2014 and rising from the U.S. warehouse circuit to European tours. After publicly announcing her transition in 2018, she began brazenly breaking down her new reality on 2020 single “Fem Queen” featuring Trannilish (“Niggas love chicks with a dick/DMs just to prove it”) and rapping about the medicinal power of getting railed on 2021’s “Dickscipline.” Since then, she’s leveled up her operation—the new album launched with a slickly choreographed video—while the themes of her work have grown more complex. On The Breakdown, she meditates on success with a mixture of pride and ambivalence, backed by moody, muted production that lets her storytelling shine.Most Brooklyn drill rappers are men, often recounting stories about dope dealing and violence. Ms. Boogie instead divulges the oft-unseen realities of sex work and dating DL (“down-low”) trans-attracted men. “I’m the plug and the drug,” she raps. “Streets is watching,” so she sends her man a black car and asks him to sign an NDA. Such tight-lipped business leaves little room for play: “I don’t need new friends/It’s a cold world, I need new Timbs,” go the bars on “Come Again,” a song whose braggadocious hook (like early-aughts Eve filtered through a codeine blunt) makes one long for more such catchy moments. But Ms. Boogie’s tale calls for a different sound.Most of the album was produced by Minneapolis’s Boo Boo, aka M Jamison, who leverages her experience scoring films. The Breakdown’s melancholy synths and dreamy strings sound like rolling through dark city streets in the rain, somewhere between Blade Runner and the symphonic grit of Mos Def’s “Auditorium.” Producer El Joven leaves metallic fingerprints on “H20” and “Build Me Up,” whose funky beats echo the confrontational sound of New York’s queer underground. Ahya Simone’s harp weaves airy grace throughout the album, most gloriously on the closing track. (Jamison and Simone are also Black trans women; nearly every hand that touched the record, including its mixing engineer, belongs to a queer or trans person of color.)",Rap,7.4
506,"Xaviersobased comes for the stoner party-rap crown on a mixtape that’s improvisatory, totally zooted, and New York through and through. Once you hear Xaviersobased, you’ll want to argue about Xaviersobased. Indifference is not an option because his music turns casual rap convos into First Take. Possibly it’s because you think his glazed vocals—sometimes pitch-shifted, sometimes layered so thick that they’re mystically fused together—absolutely suck. In some cases it may turn you into the kind of hip-hop conservative you used to make fun of.Alternatively, maybe, you’ll see the light, and go on and on, like I do, about how it’s a borderline spiritual experience, one that will have you standing around with crowds of teenagers and skaters after midnight, below underpasses, at warehouse shows with unpronounceable names on the bill, or at more standard venues (where maybe you’ll get caught in a riot, or end up posted up next to a furry), just to listen to this babyface Upper West Side 20 year old’s blur of blown-out, totally zooted dance rap.Two years ago, I was initiated into Xavier’s prolific and overwhelming churn of mixtapes and SoundCloud loosies with the self-produced “Crisp Dubs,” a lagging, rebooting single that spices up a sample from the soundtrack of an online porno gaming series. It’s so boundless that it had me convinced that I had just stumbled into the coolest shit and instantly bonded with anyone who felt the same, which is what underground rap is all about in a way. Hardly anything else in his catalog is quite like “Crisp Dubs” but it set the precedent for a style that pulls from so many different corners of popular and underground rap and online and regional cultures that pretty much nothing feels off limits. He can rap “Slap the shit out of a old nigga if he classist,” or a zillion iterations of “Two bad hoes in the trap tryna’ fuck me.” He can reimagine lost subgenres of New York or make a beat that feels like he hacked into Soulja Boy’s old GarageBand account. All for the purpose of making party rap that is infused with the DNA of party rap that came before it.Xavier’s first (and surely not last) mixtape of the year, Keep It Goin Xav, is a bottle-popping celebration. Sprinkled with clips from his interview with the tape’s host DJ Rennessy—which are mostly annoying because Rennessy lacks the identifiable charisma of memorable mixtape hosts—it’s essentially a look-at-how-far-I’ve-come project. It’s nowhere near as humorless as that sounds, though, because the music is vibrant, improvisatory, and fun as hell. In a way, it’s of a lineage with so much of the 21st century’s great hangout rap made by those below legal drinking age, from the skater’s anthems to the bedroom-made rapalongs to the Magic City soundtracks.",Rap,8.2
507,"The Toronto lo-fi rockers deliver indelible hooks with slacker nonchalance. Like many frustrated twentysomethings, Madeline Link fled the city and moved back in with her parents in early 2020. Enduring lockdown in the Ottawa suburbs where she grew up, she spent that torturous April writing and recording songs nonstop to ward off the anxiety. A year later, the arrival of PACKS’ full-length debut, the terse, 24-minute Take the Cake, solidified her talent.A few years later, Link’s solo project, PACKS, has grown into a four-piece band, and she still seems to be riding that prolific wave. Inspired by the warped popcraft of Micachu and the Shapes and the voluminous output of Guided by Voices, Link squeezes out lazily hooky, lo-fi bangers as likely to draw lyrical inspiration from 19th-century literary arcana as from her personal life. She works fast and favors crude, brittle guitar tones that repel virtuosity; “I’m not a perfectionist,” Link NME. Melt the Honey, an unshowily eclectic record warmed by the glow of new love, is the group’s third and strongest album since signing to Fire Talk in 2021.Self-recorded with minimal equipment in an eccentric communal house near Xalapa, Mexico, the album buzzes with the spirit of a weirdo songwriter carving out a creative oasis. Songs vibrate with ideas, opening with snatches of band chatter (“HFCS”) and wildlife clamor (“Missy,” a bilingual ode to a stray cat hanging around the premises). Yet Link, who fell in love shortly before making this album, injects these scuzzy creations with a certain sweetness. With its sprightly organ and pleasantly dazed melody, “Honey” milks the confusing euphoria of a new relationship that feels like “seriously what I wanted all this time.” The titular refrain—“Come on, baby/Melt the honey,” Link croons suggestively—refers to the actual honey Link ate while living with her partner in a Chilean beach town. “HFCS,” inspired by high-fructose corn syrup, is a garage-pop sugar rush, while the languid, delicately layered “Take Care” seems to be about treating a partner with more tenderness than you can extend to yourself.PACKS’ best songs deliver indelible hooks with the nonchalance of a slacker who couldn’t care less. It’s there in the downtuned psychedelia of “Trippin,” which evokes the lethargic haze of Mellow Gold-era Beck, and in the way Link exaggerates the coarse, sloppy qualities of her voice in that charmingly ’90s way on “Pearly Whites.” It’s also there in the way Link likes to repeat vocal refrains until they sound like nonsense syllables: “Fucked up, now you gotta restart/Gotta restart/Gotta restart,” she taunts on “Paige Machine.” The song refers to the fascinating saga of the Paige Compositor, a failed 1800s printing device whose creator, James W. Paige, received financial backing from Mark Twain but doomed his invention with an overcomplicated design and obsessive perfectionism. For PACKS, this seems to be a cautionary tale and guiding philosophy: overthink things and you risk winding up creatively obsolete.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

508,"On a short but charming four-song EP, the Los Angeles singer-songwriter expands on the laid-back R&B of her 2022 breakout album, finding new frames for easygoing songs about love’s ups and downs. On UMI’s 2022 debut, Forest in the City, the Seattle-born singer-songwriter’s vibey keys, soothing guitars, and layered harmonies cast a warm glow. Her lyrics, whether about failed relationships or fresh infatuations, have a charming, relatable ease; her laid-back neo-soul feels as soft and refreshing as grass coated in early-morning dew. To tee up her forthcoming sophomore album—and following “wherever u r,” a lovestruck ballad featuring BTS member V last month—UMI put together talking to the wind, a mellow stopgap EP that recalls Forest in the City’s highlights while occasionally branching out into new territory.UMI balances both bravado and vulnerability in these four succinct love songs. It’s a short EP, with no track stretching past three minutes, but that’s all the time she needs to tease out conflicting emotions. On the seductive highlight “not necessarily,” she turns her attention to a lover lacking in commitment but rich in tempting lust. “She said, ‘Am I in the mood?’” UMI sings in a chatty cadence over new-age pads and a hopscotching triplet beat, playfully capturing the ambivalence of intimacy: “‘Nope, not necessarily/But I could do it for you.’” By the time she beckons to “come here so we can act like a fool,” she sounds more wistful than the come-on might suggest, tapping into the dissonance of wanting someone who’s bad for you. She continues to explore contradictory feelings on the closer “SHOW ME OUT,” a more conventional R&B song that pinpoints a head-spinning moment of reckless love over crisp hi-hats and heavy bass. Its singsong chorus—“Baby, can you show me out?/Buy me things to brag about?”—offers a vision of moneyed romance that her lilting delivery makes sound altogether dreamy.One of the breezier tracks isn’t as successful. The jaunty, low-key disco strut of opener “why dont we go” grows monotonous even in its brief runtime; for a song about letting go and living your best life, it’s flat and curiously anonymous. UMI sounds better on the fluttering ballad “happy im,” where a fingerpicked guitar line, whistles, and loping drums guide verses sung in both English and Japanese into a free fall toward romance. Though a few lines verge upon being platitudes (“Happy I’m growing with you/Happier knowing it’s you”), she elevates the material with buoyant vocal delivery that recalls Tinashe at her tenderest. When she reaches up to her falsetto in the song’s yearning chorus, it easily replicates the head rush she’s describing.The EP is over almost as soon as it gets going, yet in little more than 10 minutes, UMI offers plenty of beguiling vocal switch-ups and intriguing wrinkles to her easy-going sound. She’s carving out her own subdued lane, wistful and carefree at once.",Pop,6.8
509,"Attempting to cement their title as a legacy rock act, Green Day absorb the kind of lazy regression they once rallied against. Billie Joe Armstrong says that he listens to punk rock every day. He wants you to know that Green Day recorded their 14th album, Saviors, while all three members were physically present in the same room because—and this part is important—that’s what real rock bands do. According to its creators, Saviors is the final installment in a trilogy that began with 1994’s breakout Dookie and 2004’s mainstream-conquering American Idiot. It’s been touted as a revival of the real Green Day: the dyed-in-the-wool East Bay punks who don’t shy away from politics, as they did on 2020’s Father of All Motherfuckers, or lean into bloated theatrics, as on 2009’s 21st Century Breakdown. It’s not the first time the band has trotted out its bona fides: 2016’s Revolution Radio was similarly promoted as a “back to basics” rock record. Saviors isn’t a return to form so much as another overcorrection, professional rebels trying to live up to their status as Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductees.“You wanna make rock’n’roll history again together?” That’s how megaproducer Rob Cavallo, who did some of his most famous studio work with the band on American Idiot, pitched frontman Billie Joe Armstrong on the creation of this album. Here’s what that sounds like: The guitars are overdriven to the point of parody, like a rock preset on GarageBand. There’s the dense opening solo on “One Eyed Bastard” that sounds strikingly similar to P!nk’s “So What,” the palm-muted downstrokes on “Coma City,” and the Blur-indebted riff that opens “Living in the ’20s.” The band is eager to honor its influences—Saviors, recorded in London, has a cover that might recall a famous UK punk group. But it often feels like Green Day are pantomiming some other band rather than embracing the three-piece rapport that made their early records so maddeningly catchy. Bassist Mike Dirnt is barely audible in the mix and Tré Cool’s drumming remains perfectly proficient, keeping time and nothing more.Green Day used to be kind of transgressive: proud stoners when weed was still anti-establishment, self-aware pranksters in a scene that took itself deadly seriously. On Saviors, their politics are milquetoast at best and dubiously reactionary at worst. Armstrong wrote opener “The American Dream Is Killing Me” around the time the band was recording Father of All Motherfuckers, but thought the song might be too much of a lightning rod in an already polarized country. Who can say if things would have gone differently had the world heard “Don’t want no huddled masses/TikTok and taxes” back in the Trump era? Within the contemporary political moment, his observations are quaint and overly broad: “People on the street/Unemployed and obsolete,” he laments on Saviors’ first song. Elsewhere, it’s hard to tell if he’s for or against enhanced policing (“Coma City”) or anti-racism (“Strange Days Are Here to Stay”). It’s a blessing that in 46 minutes Armstrong never sings the word “woke.”",Rock,5.1
510,"Swervedriver’s Adam Franklin reintroduces his solo project’s backing band as an amorphous collective; their largely instrumental album pairs psychedelic instincts with cinematic aims. Seventeen years separated the end of Swervedriver’s first run and their 2015 comeback effort, I Wasn’t Born to Lose You, but it’s not as if fans of the Oxford shoegaze pioneers were lacking for cosmic-pop thrills in the interim. After the group disbanded at the end of 1998, singer-guitarist Adam Franklin barely give his amps a chance to cool down before resurfacing with Toshack Highway, which represented both a more experimental and chilled-out antidote to his former band’s sense-obliterating squall. Once that project dissolved, he returned to his comfort zone on his 2007 solo debut, Bolts of Melody, which effectively reimagined Swervedriver with less flange and more jangle. That album title then became the name of his backing band: from 2010 onward, he released albums as Adam Franklin & the Bolts of Melody. Now, with Swervedriver’s second act seemingly on pause after 2019’s Future Ruins, Franklin is embracing the Bolts branding once again—but in this case, he’s reviving an old name to signal a new direction.On Film Noir, the Bolts of Melody moniker stands on its own. If Franklin’s name is no longer at the top of the marquee, it might be because he’s not really playing the role of frontman here. While Film Noir features several recurring players (including Locksley Taylor of Southern Ontario shoegaze faves Sianspheric, Swervedriver drummer Mikey Jones, and the late Josh Stoddard, who contributed to the record prior to his death in 2021), the album reintroduces Bolts of Melody as an amorphous recording collective. Its ranks have expanded to include Franklin’s heroes (J Mascis), his spiritual progeny (Montreal space-rockers the Besnard Lakes), and even a former EastEnders cast member (UK actor/singer Sukie Smith), among others. While the aesthetic is still plenty psychedelic, this iteration of Bolts pulls from a broader palette of sounds and instrumentation—from vibraphones to electronics—to achieve the desired otherworldly effect.Across his many bands and projects, Franklin’s cool, melodious voice has always been the focal point, but on Film Noir, he greets us more or less to say goodbye. The opening “555” marks one of the few times you hear him sing on the album, and even here his minimal, mantric vocal is but another texture in a lushly layered cosmic fantasia that more readily conjures the magisterial psych rock of Dungen and Lonerism-era Tame Impala than Franklin’s fuzz-pedaled past. As the Film Noir title strongly suggests, these 12 (mostly) instrumental vignettes were envisioned more as cinematic scores than proper rock songs. But if the songs are meant to conjure soundtracks to ’70s Euro sci-fi flicks and spaghetti westerns that don’t exist, listening to the album feels a lot like channel-surfing through B-movies at 3 a.m., stopping just long enough to get a snapshot of a film’s vibe before flipping over to the next one: “The Village Sleeps” summons all the pomp and circumstance of a royal parade in 38 seconds flat; “Harpsiglass” takes little more to show you what Pet Sounds might have sounded like if were made for a Sergio Leone film.",Rock,7.0
511,"After a run of conceptually focused projects, the Italian musician gives free rein to his atmospheric instincts on an album of immersive ambient techno. Dance music is an outdoor thing for Donato Dozzy. You never get the sense that his music is taking place inside the club: This is a music of rivers, swamps, open ocean. The Italian producer’s 2012 masterpiece Voices From the Lake, with Neel, was conceived for a set at Japan’s mountainside Labyrinth festival, and the music seemed designed to burble from the very environment, as if created by the chirping of crickets and the rustling of birds in the underbrush. Everything has a rhythm, it seemed to say. Dozzy’s solo albums tend toward focused explorations of a single style, sound, or instrument. Hearing him coax the ghost of the club from a traditional Mediterranean mouth harp or the voice of collaborator Anna Caragnano, one suspects he’d be perfectly happy as a hunter-gatherer, bashing out a rhythm on a skin drum and calling it techno.Dozzy’s new album Magda is less constrained than most of his work, and if these six long tracks stick to a fairly consistent palette of sequencer patterns surrounded by suggestive whispers and peaty squishings, there is tremendous variation within those core elements. Behemoths like “Le Chaser” and “Santa Cunegonda” coexist naturally with more ambient cuts like “Franca,” each one teasing the other. On “Le Chaser,” which sprawls over the entirety of Side B, his machines seem to have been left in the sun too long; Dozzy subtly detunes the signal so it sounds worn and faded, an ancient artifact from a time long before the invention of techno or even synthesizers. Basslines are a luxury, he’s as coy with his kick drums as ever, and when we hear a consistent 4/4 pulse it’s often startling to realize we haven’t heard a bass drum for a long time.Dozzy has a DJ’s knack for sequencing, always creating subtle setups and payoffs that proceed almost imperceptibly. Because the sequenced synths are mixed so loudly compared to everything else, it’s easy to miss what’s happening in the margins, and you may not notice the addition of a new element until it’s been going strong for two or three minutes. Things that feel almost like hooks emerge imperceptibly from the primordial soup, like the drone on opener “Velluto” that eventually yields to a graceful melody that arcs up and up, or the frantic synth pattern on “Le Chaser” that suggests Carl Craig’s hair-raising remix of Junior Boys’ “Like a Child.” The album requires a few listens to really sink in: first to take it all in, and then to blot out what’s happening in the foreground and pay attention to the details.",Electronic,7.3
512,"The Canadian producer laces glow-worm synths and house beats with vocal snippets culled from indie-folk gems and Billboard hits. Toronto-based producer Loukeman’s winsome dance tracks are an elevated take on the cheeky DJ edits and remixes that litter the annals of his longstanding SoundCloud account. He plucks vocal earworms out of folk, pop, and R&B songs, bending them into familiar yet malformed shapes that titter mysteriously at the margins of his booming house beats. As in the work of Todd Edwards, it’s not so much what Loukeman’s unwitting guest stars say as it is how they say it: the timbre of an errant syllable, the percussive musicality of a phrase repeated until it fractalizes. Since his 2021 debut, Sd-1, he’s earned cosigns from Vegyn and Jacques Greene. His latest album, Sd-2—the second of a planned trilogy—is more of an expansion pack than a sequel, a fresh suite of wistful trinkets that slot seamlessly alongside their predecessors.Loukeman’s identifiable samples offer an answer key to his inspirations. He regularly pulls from intimate, romantic performances, using their pleading registers to lend even his highest-energy tracks a bittersweet edge. Sd-1’s “Shadowww” is instructive in this regard, flipping the weary strums of Lomelda’s “Hannah Sun” into an easygoing, uptempo groove that belies torrents of feeling. Sd-2 is quick to draw from this same emotional playbook: Album opener “Baby You’re a Star” complements folkish acoustic riffs with the sonorous vocal runs of Mario’s “Let Me Love You,” chopping and stretching his libidinal cries into abstract warbles. “Winzzz” uses the distinctly robotic, chattering artifacts of stem separation to great effect as it strips PARTYNEXTDOOR’s “The News” down to a single echoing chorus—Do you deserve me? No way—illuminated by a glowing bassline.Part of Sd-2’s charm is the plasticity Loukeman wrings from his fairly defined style. While he clearly knows what he likes, he’s not afraid to introduce new, off-kilter elements, throwing well-adjusted ears into disarray. “Ride”’s strobing synth lines are supplemented with furious drum breaks and bed squeaks that override the track’s chipmunk vocal squeals with manic, indulgent irreverence. The same anything-goes spirit creeps into Loukeman’s erratic DJ sets, where you’ll catch him mixing synthwave instrumentals into Chief Keef or playing the Shins’ “New Slang” atop a thundering techno beat. When “Real Life Man” whirls together acid-house toplines, chalky guitars, and the plaintive lead of Bryson Tiller’s “Exchange,” the cocktail is both patently ridiculous and effortlessly cool.If Sd-2 has a fault, it’s that its general breeziness feeds into a subtle but pervasive reticence. Songs plateau rather than peak, lounging in moody states that conclude with little fanfare. Not every piece needs a defined rise and arc, especially in a dance context; Loukeman plays to this angle by emphasizing his production chops, embroidering subtle background details and stutters that jump out on repeat listens. But the unfocused compositions become a problem as the album slips into a comfortable, anodyne lull in its back half, splitting time between interludes and longer tracks that both invoke atmosphere without resolution. On a better-paced project, a small song like “Won’t U” might have a real purpose as a breather between set pieces; instead, its operatic, thrumming synthwave swells ebb into filler. Though the case for Loukeman’s raw talent is airtight, Sd-2 doesn’t quite transcend his worst habits. Even so, it remains a compelling, if occasionally insubstantial, document of an emerging artist with undeniable presence.",Electronic,7.0
513,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit a 1983 masterpiece whose sumptuous sonics and ecstatic approach to songwriting brought post-punk into a mysterious world beyond words. In the beginning, I didn’t get on at all with Cocteau Twins. When Head Over Heels came out in October 1983, BBC radio DJ John Peel played the entire album on his show. Listening that night in my student room, the wispiness and warbling rubbed me the wrong way.I decided to give the record another chance after reading a rave review in the NME. Suddenly, I had the key to the secret garden. What had first felt bombastic and hollow became cavernous, like stepping inside a grotto glistening with stalactites. The insubstantiality of the guitar sound, initially so frustrating, became intoxicating, like a heady fragrance. As for that wuthering voice: this was simply the sprite that would inhabit such a wonderland, singing in an alien tongue as impassioned as it was incomprehensible.Head Over Heels is the perfect title for this record. You’re not meant to cogitate or extract profound literal meaning from these sounds, as was the case with so much post-punk in the immediately prior years. You’re supposed to tumble into its cascading bliss.“Head over heels” also describes the state of mind of its makers, guitarist Robin Guthrie and singer Elizabeth Fraser. Guthrie has described it as an album of love songs. If so, they are veiled and opaque, hints glinting out now and then in a stray song title (“My Love Paramour”) or rare intelligible lyric (“There’s only a hair’s breadth between us”). Mostly, the feeling comes across non-verbally, as it does almost always with Fraser’s singing, through the swoony elation of her voice.The romance sparked at a discotheque. Robin Guthrie, budding guitarist and occasional DJ at The Hotel International in Grangemouth, Scotland, was spinning records by proto-goth groups like the Birthday Party, tunes that completely emptied the floor. Except for this one girl with startling hair and jewelry made of chicken bones. Guthrie reasoned that someone who could dance that expressively might be able to sing.For nearly all their career, Cocteau Twins have actually been triplets: Simon Raymonde took on the role of bassist shortly after the release of Head Over Heels, a role occupied in the early days by Guthrie’s friend Will Heggie. But Heggie had quit by the time it came to record Head Over Heels, so the lovey-dovey couple made the album alone together, which surely contributed to its atmosphere of almost stifling intimacy.“The Cocteau Twins just happened and the music just happens,” Guthrie informed ZigZag magazine. Maybe this remark was another evasion from a notoriously interview-averse group, but there’s an element of truth. They wrote Head Over Heels, like all of their subsequent records, in the studio, showing up with nothing: no tunes, no titles, no premeditated sonic intentions beyond trying to make an album.",Rock,9.6
514,"A new reissue of the ill-fated shoegazers’ 1998 album reminds us that even as their fortunes were fading, they remained undeterred in their pursuit of psychedelic bliss. The story of Swervedriver is the story of ’90s alternative rock as told in four acts. There was the buzz-building debut, 1991’s Raise, which put the Oxford band at the crest of the first shoegaze wave alongside Creation labelmates My Bloody Valentine and Ride. There was the flirtation with American major-label crossover success on 1993’s Mezcal Head, which saw them touring with Smashing Pumpkins at their Siamese Dream pinnacle. Then there was the big swing for Britpop glory on 1995’s Ejector Seat Reservation, which failed to impress the bean counters: A&M declined to release it in the U.S., prompting Creation to drop the band in the UK. As if that wasn’t dispiriting enough, in 1997 the band would get picked up by another American major, DGC, only to get dumped before they could release a record with them. So for their fourth album, 99th Dream, Swervedriver joined the ranks of former ’90s hopefuls who were forced to make a return trip to indieville. They self-released the record on their own Sonic Wave Discs imprint in the UK and through Zero Hour in the U.S.; a band that once called Oasis and Soundgarden labelmates was now rubbing shoulders with college-rock survivors like Steve Wynn and proggy misfits like Space Needle.By the time of 99th Dream’s release in 1998, Swervedriver were positioned outside not just the major-label ecosystem, but virtually every alt-rock movement. Most of their shoegazer peers from the dawn of the decade had broken up (or entered their eternal hibernation phase); grunge was dead and gone; the Britpop bubble had burst; and fans of left-field guitar bands were delving into post-rock or exploring electronic music. So on 99th Dream, Swervedriver committed to simply being the truest version of themselves: a band whose effects-pedal fetishism was matched by its affinity for sundazed melodies. And while they may not have envisioned 99th Dream as a swan song, the album’s wistfully nostalgic lyrics and comedown vibe made it the most existential in their catalog. “I’m not waiting for the world,” singer-guitarist Adam Franklin declared on the anthemic Beatles-’68 reverie “She Weaves a Tender Trap”; months later, Swervedriver broke up.When stacked against Swervedriver’s previous releases, 99th Dream largely abandons the artsy ambitions and widescreen production of Ejector Seat Reservation for a more back-to-basics approach, but retains the melodic finesse they had honed over the years. The opening track functions as a microcosm of their career up: The “Misirlou”-like intro provides a loud echo of the trash-Americana fascinations that fueled Swervedriver’s earliest work, but that frantic high-octane fanfare gives way to a rhapsodic, gently swaying sing-along bathed in waves of wah-wah. 99th Dream may have marked Swervedriver’s return to the underground, but in their heads, they were still playing a sundown set at Glastonbury.",Rock,8.0
515,"Grief clarifies the air in Sleater-Kinney’s taut 11th album, which processes loss and societal turmoil and finds strength in chosen family. In the process of digging oneself out, a little rope could help. By the fall of 2022, Carrie Brownstein required it. Sleater-Kinney had just begun recording their taut and cathartic 11th album, Little Rope, when Corin Tucker—her co-creator, 30 years ago now, of the genius post-riot grrrl band—received a phone call from the U.S. embassy in Italy attempting to notify Brownstein that her mother and stepfather had been killed in a car accident. Death clarified the air in the room of Little Rope, intensified its tenor, and distilled its priorities. All of the nascent songs—which amount to Sleater-Kinney’s sturdiest, catchiest rock record since 2015’s hiatus-breaking No Cities to Love and their most somber since 1999’s The Hot Rock—were immediately “dragged into the hellscape” of grief, Brownstein said in an interview, adding, “I needed to hear Corin’s voice.”Sleater-Kinney are synonymous with determinedly clawing out a sense of self and ripping up patriarchal models to restructure the rock’n’roll order. But their Great Feminist Songbook has always included mortality, sorrow, and dying: the guttural punk standard “Good Things,” the hospital-room plea “The Size of Our Love,” the picture of a Golden Gate suicide on “Jumpers,” the dread-laced drama of comeback single “Bury Our Friends.” Even so, Sleater-Kinney have rarely plumbed such autobiographical reservoirs of sadness as they do on Little Rope, responding not only to loss but also self-doubt, societal despair, and depression. Brownstein said, “Finishing this record was basically my way of praying every day,” and her brutally vulnerable lyrics evoke spectral communion. “I forgive you, I wish I told you so,” she sings on the anthemic “Hunt You Down.” “I send your ashes my love.”Little Rope is the fourth album of Sleater-Kinney’s second act, their second since drummer Janet Weiss left and subtracted an irreplaceable frequency. In the 1990s and 2000s, Sleater-Kinney seemed to contain their own secret language in the legendary criss-crossing interplay of Tucker and Brownstein’s dueling down-tuned guitars and counterpointed screams. “Living in Olympia, we had lost perspective on what a traditional group looked or sounded like,” Brownstein wrote of the origins of their entanglement in her 2015 memoir. “My entire style of playing was built around somebody else playing guitar with me, a story that on its own sounds unfinished, a sonic to-be-continued, designed to be completed by someone else.” Today that mysterious lexicon feels more transparent. The coordinates where Tucker and Brownstein once met—friction, unprettiness, imposing stakes, the shared consciousness of their work’s insurmountable consequence—have no doubt shifted. But still they meet. Togetherness remains Sleater-Kinney’s essence.",Rock,7.7
516,"On his ninth studio album, the Man on the Moon has never sounded more checked out. Near the middle of “Often, I Have These Dreamz,” the first track of INSANO, Kid Cudi recalls a dream of falling back to Earth. The song’s thundering drums fade into the background and guest DJ Drama barks an ad lib (“Cudi, talk to ’em!”) before Cudi proceeds to stumble through the most milquetoast fantasy imaginable. “I have these dreams of me falling through the sky, you know what I’m sayin’?/And uh, somehow, before I hit the ground, I start flyin’... I fly back up to the sky, you know, high as fuck/High as fuck, past the planets,” he says, practically mid-bong rip, before diving into a verse of empty product placement and cliché mythmaking.Cudi has attempted to sell himself as both an underdog and a superstar since the blog era, but the more he parlays his late-aughts musical clout into the worlds of film, television, and fashion, the harder this image has become to take seriously. His failure to meaningfully evolve as a musician isn’t the only reason INSANO is a bad record. The best Cudi songs have at least enough sense of direction and confidence to convince you to buy in. Even his much-maligned psych-rock album Speedin’ Bullet 2 Heaven had some passion coursing through it. Here, that yen is gone—he’s never sounded more checked out. Even Cudi doesn’t seem to believe his own hype anymore.To its credit, INSANO is trying to do something different—that different thing, however, is just having DJ Drama provide thin narrative window dressing to a spate of uninspired Kid Cudi songs. Classic Cudi moments where he grapples with his demons, like “Tortured” or the XXXTentacion-featuring “X & Cud,” are retreads of stories he’s told better and with more conviction elsewhere. What’s left are flex and rage raps that are somehow hollow and overwrought at the same time. On “Keep Bouncin’” and “Cud Life,” his staccato flow is undermined by his drawn-out slur, a vocal affect that doesn’t make the bland boasts about white Benzes or faceless groupies any more interesting. “A Tale of a Knight” is part autobiography and part anonymous bacchanalia, hampered by more annoying vocal tics and production I can only describe as Hans Zimmer trying to recreate the beat for Young Thug and Gunna’s four-year-old “Hot” after hearing it from a passing car at rush hour. The more Cudi tries to spin these songs as effortless and fun, the more labored and rote they sound.",Rap,4.6
517,"The Detroit rapper broke out in 2021 with an unmistakably funky style and jokes for days. Now he has to do it again. In wrestling, one of the most euphoric moments is the debut of a new character with a cool-ass look and a devastating move—think of Brock Lesnar teleporting into the ring in 2002 with muscles grown on his muscles, leaving nothing but carnage. The hard part is getting beyond that initial awe and turning into a weekly personality, the type of character that you want to latch onto. That’s sort of what Bruiser Wolf is going through on his second album, My Stories Got Stories.The Bruiser Brigade standout is one of those rappers that could make you pull over to the side of the road when you first hear them. Maybe for you it was one of his guest turns on early 2021 albums by fellow Bruiser Brigade MCs J.U.S or Fat Ray, where his flows sound like Willie Dynamite at 2x speed. Or maybe it was later that year, when he stole the limelight on the Detroit crew’s Alchemist-produced posse cut with a collage of doughboy memories and witty punchlines. Most likely it was his 2021 album Dope Game Stupid, where his conversational slick talk combined with Raphy beats that sounded like they should be blasting out of a Cadillac Eldorado. It holds up well over 13 joints. Now he has to do it again, and you can feel the pressure to adopt an incrementally more conventional style weighing on the album.For one, the raps on My Stories Got Stories are less funky than they were on Dope Game Stupid. There’s nothing as out-there as him getting in his Curtis Mayfield bag for the bleak yet sticky hook of “Momma Was a Dopefiend” or the hyperactive and dark chants of “the dope fiend my best friend” on “Middle Men” that come directly after Fat Ray’s hearty reinterpretation of 50 Cent’s timeless chorus. The closest Bruiser Wolf gets on this album is the end of “Let the Young Boys Eat,” where he puts his spin on the breezy sung melodies you could find all over 1990s Bay Area rap albums. Even the beats—there’s still plenty of Raphy, but also others like Harry Fraud and Dag—bring to mind Griselda’s hard-nosed soul samples rather than, say, Cotton Comes to Harlem.But he’s an eccentric enough rapper that even the streamlined version of his style is still a pretty fun ride. On “Looney Tunes,” he’s got his flow on a yo-yo as he changes speeds and stitches together details that add color to his dope-dealing flashbacks (“Just a Detroit hustler rocking the Fila brand”). His best bars are hilarious because of their specificity and randomness: “You sing like J.T. from The Five Heartbeats/My nigga, that’s a City Girl.” All of the dope analogies on “Holla at Ya Mans” are killer, including “had the white girl doing hot yoga” and “finessed the plug with Terms of Endearment.” Raphy’s beat on “G’z & Hustlaz” has that splash of opulence the others don’t and Wolf glides over it, though the flows could be quirkier. They are on “Crack Cocaine,” where he stretches his voice to a register higher than Money Talk.",Rap,6.1
518,"The Atlanta star’s third solo album balances a new level of celebrity and the icy realism that’s long been his signature. One of 21 Savage’s earliest forays into letter-writing came on the penultimate track of 2018’s i am > i was, where he penned an apologetic and appreciative tribute to his mother, Heather Carmillia Joseph, for dealing with his teenage mischief. It wasn’t the first time that he’d revealed such an interior window—all over the album he posited himself as a tormented agent of the macabre, unable to shake the traumatic memories while also enjoying the spoils of his riches—but it signified a unique willingness to go long on personal soliloquy. On his latest release, american dream, his mom returns the favor, opening the album with a spoken-word dedication that alludes to the countless sacrifices she undertook to help him achieve his wildest dreams. Instead of nestling the emotional weight away in the corner, 21 uses it as a battering ram, bursting through the door to begin to try to paint the full picture of who he has become.And it’s a tall task. 21’s profile has grown in recent years, with a collaborative album and tour with Drake, humanitarian initiatives that made him a community leader in Atlanta—hell, even the teaser “trailer” credits for american dream read like an Emmy after-party invite list. His third solo album attempts to balance reveling in his newfound elevated celebrity and retaining the tortured persona that relishes in recounting the gruesome details of his journey. This produces some missteps, but the 31 year old cuts through the glossy excess with clarity and lyrical self-assuredness, producing enough sterling moments to show that he’s still a star worthy of fanfare.The line between inventive use of samples and cynical nostalgia-bait is thin; maybe 21 learned from the disastrous hijacking of Daft Punk on Her Loss’ “Circo Loco.” The crack team of producers on american dream—including Metro Boomin, Cardo, Coupe, London on da Track, and OG Parker—attempt to string together more moments of harmony between 21’s reserved register and the production landscape, rather than taking big swings at grandiosity. Rose Royce lead singer Gwen Dickey’s lilting voice echoes in the background of “all of me,” creating a morose arena in which 21 dwells upon the violence and backstabbing he survived to reach this stage of his life. The album’s crate-digging finds (like Brazilian singer Elza Laranjeira’s angelic crooning from “Serenata do Adeus” on “redrum”) mesh better than the easily recognizable tributes (Faith Evans and K-Ci loops on “prove it” and “should’ve wore a bonnet”), but the overall cohesion of the production is a welcome sign.",Rap,6.8
519,"The Baltimore/Philadelphia duo builds on the harmonious folk-pop of its debut with proggy synths, maze-like arrangements, and a newfound sense of mischief. There’s a scene in Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret., the recent film adaptation of Judy Blume’s 1970 novel for middle schoolers, where four girls try an exercise that’s rumored to help breasts grow faster. In the privacy of one girl’s frilly bedroom, they thrust their elbows back and forth aggressively, like doing the backstroke with chicken wings, while chanting, “We must, we must, we must increase our bust!” That slice of adolescent desperation is ludicrous and awkward, both to viewers and the girls themselves. While Victoria Rose and Stone Filipczak are more than twice the age of those protagonists, the two musicians—known together as the duo @—revel in a similar mix of strange and endearing growing pains on the cheekily titled Are You There God? It’s Me, @, which contrasts the harmonious folk-pop of their debut album, Mind Palace Music, with an endless scrapbook of glitchy psychedelia. Across five new songs, that mixture produces a colorful spread that occasionally clashes.During the lockdown phases of the pandemic, Rose and Filipczak made their music from a distance, and they continued that approach on Are You There God? It’s Me, @, passing drafts back and forth between Philadelphia and Baltimore. However, they did change their production methods in order to challenge their writing. Software instrumentation and processed vocals push the humanness of @’s warm, acoustic sound in a more robotic, but equally stirring, direction. Songs like “Processional” and “Webcrawler” turn the duo’s hypnotic voices into trance-like screensavers over proggy keys, mutating rhythms, and hyperpop production touches. Sometimes, though, their enthusiasm gets the better of them; beholding the searing classic-rock guitar solo and coordinated rah rahs of “Webcrawler” are a little like watching a preteen trying on ill-advised outfits.Rose has always had a striking voice that’s pure and direct, both in @ and and her solo project Brittle Brian, and her soothing tones inject some welcome naturalism back into the fold. On the title track, she sings choral harmonies about struggling to touch a loved one who’s hiding, looping her vocals into fractured rounds. Filipczak begins weaving his own voice into the a cappella mix until, at the halfway mark, the audio abruptly stutters and the song snaps into a totally different shape. The band goes full twee—complete with flute, rock-steady drumming, and a thin, bouncy bassline—in a move that’s daring in its simplicity. Bookended with proggier songs, the title track feels doubly refreshing, making @’s knack for ’70s-indebted harmonies and warm hooks all the more obvious.",Rock,6.9
520,"The Virginia band takes the drama of screamo and black metal to grandiose new heights. What kind of music best suits an era of sociopolitical upheaval? While Obsidian Wreath is playing, blackened screamo seems like the only acceptable answer. Infant Island’s third album is yet another broad-gesturing statement about these times in an era overflowing with like-minded music, but Obsidian Wreath embodies the chaos more than it chastises about it. The sense of drama is sky-high, from the desperate-sounding clean strums and roll of rim clicks that open “Another Cycle” to the self-immolating coda that ignites just when closer “Vestygian” seems like it’s dying out. This isn’t the angriest skramz album, nor is it the prettiest, but there’s a good chance that it’s the most tempestuous.Infant Island already married black metal’s massive scale with screamo’s purple hues on 2020’s Ben and Sepulcher EP, but both feel icy and brittle in comparison to Obsidian Wreath’s warm, heaving textures. Alongside the baked-in Virginia skramz ancestry, the band singles out Panopticon and Deafheaven as chief influences: The former’s penchant for folk and bowed instruments and the latter’s lush guitar tones provide a roadmap for evolution. Even if you reduced Obsidian Wreath to a standard guitar-bass-drums setup, it would feel baroque and grandiose. Alexander Rudenshiold and Winston Givler’s guitars sound beyond multi-tracked; it’s as if there’s a few rows of players all shredding to sheet music. The tremolo-heavy style of picking in many songs almost replicates the buzz of a string section. Drummer Austin O’Rourke conducts the maelstrom both literally—he is additionally credited with piano, cello, accordion, mandolin, and orchestral arrangement—and figuratively, as his stickwork guides the music between unexpected movements that nevertheless hit all of the marks.The album opens with the furiously paced “Another Cycle” and “Fulfilled,” which both eventually deliver varied takes on the never-tired “bring back the nasty riff but slower” trope. From there, Infant Island begin to flex their extracurricular talents. “Found Hand” is an eerie noise piece akin to those on Beneath and Sepulcher. The mid-album suite of “Veil” and “Amaranthine” moves between uplifting, anthemic gang vocals, a delicate acoustic passage, and bookending peaks. “Kindling,” featuring ​​Harper Boyhtari and Logan Gaval of the doomgaze band Greet Death, spends its first half as a slowcore song. It’s not as if Infant Island need these deviations to freshen up their sound—their screamo base is already tempered by black metal, which is in turn undercut by a grindcore-esque rhythmic creativity that avoids the fatigue of constant blastbeats. But Obsidian Wreath’s softest moments add to its overall heft, the rising and falling actions lending more weight than an end-to-end sonic assault would.Written in 2020, Obsidian Wreath is, according to the press release, yet another “pandemic record.” The band cites the United States’ “apathy towards social health,” along with the ongoing crises of climate and capitalism, as the primary targets of Rudenshiold and lead vocalist Daniel Kost’s lyrics. Cut-and-dry sentiments like “How could you spare to inconvenience your comfort?” share space with characteristic screamo abstractions like “Eternity weaved over your lavender grave.” Of course, you’d need a lyric sheet to grasp Infant Island’s politics, but Obsidian Wreath’s visceral churn is a natural fit for the looming specters determining the fate of the planet. While their music has never seemed more suited for apocalypse, the future of Infant Island feels newly limitless.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

521,"After the Britpop gestures and electronic touches of her last two albums, the UK singer-songwriter explores a more pared-back mode that highlights her incisive lyrics. Across her last two albums, Marika Hackman has been wresting herself from the dusky, somber folk songs of her 2015 debut, We Slept at Last. On 2017’s I’m Not Your Man, the British singer-songwriter tweaked her palette with nods to ’90s Britpop and a mischievous punk spirit. Hackman’s third full-length, Any Human Friend, was moodier, but still felt like a pointed departure, swapping softly strummed dirges for an electro-pop-rock hybrid along the lines of London’s Field Music and Hot Chip. But then, it all stopped. In 2020, Hackman developed an acute case of writer’s block; it was so paralyzing that she feared she’d never press another track to vinyl. Her new album, Big Sigh, is the result of slowly piecing songs together over the last few years and finding the confidence to helm production for the first time.Likening the process to cracking into a block of ice, Hackman chipped away at writing Big Sigh with weary determination. Sometimes, the songs cleaved off easily in glistening hunks—but occasionally, you can hear the labor that went into all that chiseling. Acoustic closer “The Yellow Mile” is effortless and demure, its finespun fingerpicking reminiscent of Hackman’s earliest work. Little more than a mingling of guitar and her delicate register, “The Yellow Mile” is an uncluttered canvas where Hackman’s incisive lyrics glint like blades. Chronicling an unhealthy relationship, she likens her stasis within it to that of a wounded bug. “I left my body in your care,” she sings, teasing a happy ending. The hairpin turn that follows is jarring: “You plucked my wings off and I went slack/I was a beetle on my back.” Hackman has always been adept at spiking sweet melodies with venomous couplets, and “The Yellow Mile” is a lean and prickly fusion of those tendencies.Slow-burner “Vitamins” is from the same playbook, pairing hushed dynamics with gritty imagery. Here, Hackman meddles with the formula, coating her voice in metallic layers and sending the song out on a warped synth arpeggio. “Mum says I’m a waste of skin/A sack of shit and oxygen,” she sings. An electronic chirp cuts through her placid vocal, sounding almost like a dying heart monitor. There is something extremely vulnerable about Hackman’s plainspoken admissions of feeling worthless, a sentiment that’s somehow sharpened by her detached, steely voice.Big Sigh is notably less poppy than Hackman’s prior two albums, but the most energetic tracks on the record are also its best. “No Caffeine” and “Slime,” both of which were released as singles last year, merge her sober delivery with sly hooks. “Slime,” a callback to the randy songs on Any Human Friend, is an ode to sticky, unfettered sex. What starts as a moody ’90s alternative ballad cracks open to reveal a tart and chewy guitar-pop core. Opener “No Caffeine” shares more DNA with the dramatic Britpop of I’m Not Your Man, stacking strings atop palm-muted guitar and swelling horns. Hackman penned the lyrics as a litany of “cures” for her crushing anxiety—self-written prescriptions for herbal tea, wine, TV, and sleep. As the power chords surge in the chorus, catharsis sets in.",Folk,7.2
522,"The gravel-voiced Nashville rapper’s writing is all tension with just enough release to ensure he doesn’t explode. For over 20 years, Starlito has been rapping about how stressful it is to be a rapper. Years on the independent mixtape grind in his native Nashville put his slippery monotone within earshot of Cash Money in the mid-2000s, and the artist formerly known as All $tar used his growing platform to grapple with the increasingly high costs of fame. He can shit talk and flex with the best of them—he and Memphis rapper Don Trip’s Step Brothers series is a masterclass in affable and thoughtful bully rap—but he won’t pretend the strain of real life and the rap industry hasn’t put him on the verge of quitting altogether. Fearing his biggest hit, 2005’s oft-remixed “Grey Goose,” would box him into a corner as an alcohol rapper, he’s made sure to split time between partying and pain rap, channeling the tact and entrepreneurial savvy of a Young Dolph or Key Glock without the outsized persona.On Love Drug, his first solo project since 2020’s Paternity Leave, his raps still cut to the bone, but his outlook has metastasized into something even darker. Starlito’s knack for standing firm in the middle of the storm gives every story lethal urgency, whether it’s about a shootout or just a dead phone battery. But this time, there’s no lighthearted hijinks to dilute the soul-crushingly heavy thoughts. Opener “Writer’s Block” bleeds from various losses—dead friends he should be sharing oysters with, love affairs barely remembered through the haze of a Xanax addiction. Even brief moments of respite (“I celebrate breakin’ even”) are immediately followed by more strife (“I ain’t say it was easy”). Throughout Love Drug, Starlito’s writing is all tension with just enough release to ensure he doesn’t explode.That sorrow is the album’s lifeblood, the harrowing byproduct of systems that suck the profit and vitality out of the Black bodies not being set up to fail on street corners. On highlight “Put the Gun Down Craig,” a plot beat from the 1995 comedy classic Friday inspires intense reflections on the ripple effect of gun violence, from familial paranoia to snitch culture. “I hate we had to shoot guns, can’t lie; I don’t want no new smoke,” he says plainly, as producer DTdaKidd’s bass and drums pop like shots. Compare that to “iH8RAP,” the album’s only stumble, where good points about media literacy and false rapper personae are drowned out by preachy soapboxing and a guest appearance from YouTube shock jock Charleston White. Lito doesn’t need the help to make his messages any more powerful: “‘Feed your mind, starve your ego,’ I got that from Starlito/This part from Jermaine, align your heart with your brain.”Otherwise, his blunt thoughtfulness continues to carry his rumbling voice far. He stands tall next to guests like Alabama’s bluesy bard NoCap (“Don’t Cry,” “Pocket Full of Pain”) and punches through the beats, whether a somber groove from producer ZIPS (“Wanna Be There”) or an earthshaker by Memphis heavy hitter Tay Keith (“Bipolar Bear”). Lito stays 10 toes through it all, outwardly unmoored but desperately trying to maintain from within. His quiet devastation comes to a head on closer “Retire My Jersey,” which mixes in autobiography and lessons from Gucci Mane and former labelmate Lil Wayne with the bloodletting. “In the airport, they call me the GOAT/When I’m in the mirror, feel like I’m seeing ghosts,” he says, flow harsh and direct as a mug of black coffee. Starlito may never outrun his demons, but he’s more than content to let the work speak for itself.",Rap,7.4
523,"On its debut album, the Dublin-based post-punk band channels rage into communal uplift. Since forming in 2019, Sprints have released a series of short, ferocious singles and EPs. Songwriter and guitarist Karla Chubb’s dry, comical chants often give way to blistering screeds in a manner of seconds. Anger management worked to a point: On the 2022 single “Delia Smith,” she pondered taking the edge off her eccentricities: “Who wants to be special anyway?” Still, she couldn’t help but answer the question with a defiant scream: “Me, fucking me/And I’m not ashamed.”On its debut full-length, Letter to Self, the four-piece attempts to channel its rage into communal uplift. “Anger doesn’t mean bad,” Chubb told DIY. “Anger means you’re standing up for something; anger means you’re addressing an issue; anger also means collectiveness.” Letter to Self is a bracing, frantic record designed for both thrashing mosh pits and solo meltdowns, best heard with the volume turned up loud. The racing guitars and fuzzy distortion of “Ticking” and “Heavy” transform paralyzing fear into something that can be batted away with enough headbanging.Sprints operate like a fitness trainer giving you some tough love—sure, you could take a breather, but it won’t make you any stronger. Letter to Self was produced by Daniel Fox of Gilla Band, who have shaped the Ireland punk scene for almost a decade now. Sprints no doubt take much from Gilla Band, but their inspiration spans far and wide: “Adore Adore Adore,” Chubb’s tormenting screed on misogyny, is reminiscent of Rid of Me-era PJ Harvey. The band’s most manic songs, like the splintering Catholic-guilt noise rocker “Cathedral,” bring to mind the vicious feminist punk of Savages (whom Chubb often cites as inspiration).The album isn’t locked into just one emotional register, though. Chubb and guitarist Colm O’Reilly play searingly bright pop melodies that pierce through the heavy buzz of stacked amps, bringing a bit of levity to their righteousness. Bassist and vocalist Sam McCann adds a wistful tone when he echoes Chubb’s lyrics, as in the grungy “Shaking Their Hands.” Even when you expect a rush of power chords, Sprints have a knack for breaking tension some other way. On “A Wreck (A Mess),” a humorous dance-punk ode to hyperactivity and social anxiety, Chubb sings with a Matt Berninger-like lilt over just a guitar strum: “Can you hear that sound?/Can you hear that silence?/Can you hear it surround?” Quiet is no reprieve: “It invites violence on me!” she yells, corralling the band for a rollicking chorus.Occasionally Sprints spread the towering sound a little too thin, and the energy flags on “Shadow of a Doubt” and “Can’t Get Enough of It.” The upbeat tracks are more fun. “Literary Mind,” a re-recording of a 2023 single, remains a standout, capturing the jagged peaks of sapphic yearning with a flirty bassline and, of course, lovelorn screaming—“She Will” for the present decade. And on the sardonic “Up and Comer,” Chubb echos the voices of her critics—“They say she’s good for an up and comer”—before shattering through their doubts with noisy self-acceptance: “If you beat her like a drum/If you beat her like a heart/I bet she’ll fire for you still/I swear to God she’ll make a start,” she belts. Her rage builds toward a piercing climax that feels earned.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

524,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit a wild slice of ’70s Dylan, an album whose air of magic and misdirection remains utterly unique in his catalog. [Scene 1: West Village, New York City, 1975. A legendary songwriter, mid-30s, is surveying the neighborhood where he cut his teeth a decade before. A violinist, younger and without his star status, but striking, with long dark hair and mysterious poise, enters stage right.]The passerby was Scarlet Rivera, a previously unknown musician whose hypnotic violin became the signature sound of Bob Dylan’s newly minted touring group, the Rolling Thunder Revue, and his gestational new album, Desire. Naturally, Dylan—world historic genius, generational icon, and general weirdo—pulled over his car, resolved to ask her just exactly what her deal was. For an artist so concerned with myth, this chance encounter must have been irresistible. Was she phantom, muse, or curse? Was she really named Scarlet Rivera? “I meet witchy women. I wish they’d leave me alone,” he told Jonathan Cott, in a 1978 Rolling Stone, not stopping to consider the possibility that the feeling was mutual. Not long after the album came out, she vanished from his life and the public eye.As with so much Dylan lore—from the fabled teenage eye contact with Buddy Holly to the arrest in Springsteen’s childhood neighborhood—it seems too unlikely to be true, and too preposterously random to invent. It’s of a piece with the world of Desire, where what’s real and what’s weird are largely indistinguishable.Dylan’s previous record, the precision-controlled display of omniscient superego that was 1975’s Blood on the Tracks, had set an impossibly high standard for its follow-up. In response, Desire was a fantasia of grave injustices and grave robberies, exotic and dangerous locales, broiling days and fleeting gestures in the face of grim destiny. Its nine songs spread out over 56 minutes, co-mingling protest folk, travelogue tunes, throwback country, and sideways klezmer, all comprising one peculiar episode in the baffling sweep of his career. Blood on the Tracks was a document of personal and romantic trauma that traced an outline around a generation who prized individual freedoms to the point of self-annihilating alienation. Desire is about getting stoned and strange and trying to forget about all of that.Desire is not a subtle album, and it does not commence on a subtle note. “Hurricane”—an audacious eight-and-a-half minute recounting of the 1966 arrest and conviction of the middleweight boxer Rubin “Hurricane” Carter on charges of triple homicide—begins with the interweaving and insinuating strains of Dylan’s acoustic guitar and Rivera’s violin. One of seven songs on Desire co-authored with the playwright Jacques Levy, it employs stage directions to set its scenery: “Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night/Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall.” Intentional or not, the effect of the dramaturgy is to suggest a not-strictly-speaking-literal recounting of events, introducing the queasy sensation that we are being carried along by storytellers whose commitment to the facts is secondary to their impulse to thrill and desperation to deliver a higher truth.",Rock,9.0
525,"A new reissue of Lou Reed’s final solo album spotlights a side of the New York icon that few ever got to see: a quiet ambient composer. For all the chaos in his music—and despite his famously combative reputation—Lou Reed was a dedicated practitioner of yoga, meditation, and martial arts. He began studying tai chi as part of an effort to get off speed and booze and strengthen his wrecked body as the 1970s drew to a close. An early teacher recalls Reed’s hands shaking so hard he could barely hold the positions, but he stuck with it. When he toured, he brought along his swords and instructional VHS tapes, practicing in hotel gyms and conference rooms; upon returning home he was known to take the taxi straight from the airport to class. In the final six years of his life, he intensified his focus, doing six days of tai chi followed by one day of yoga, week in and week out. Laurie Anderson, his partner of 21 years, said he was “looking for magic.” He was doing breathwork when he died, in fact—eyes wide open and hands in a tai chi position, with Anderson’s arms around him.Newly remastered and reissued with extensive liner notes by Light in the Attic, Hudson River Wind Meditations was first released in 2007, on a small Louisville, Colorado, label specializing in self-help and spirituality. But in the beginning, it wasn’t meant for public consumption at all. According to Anderson, Reed made early versions of these pieces to accompany guided meditations recited by Shelley Peng, an herbalist and acupuncturist. The music eventually morphed into a soundtrack for his tai chi practice, although not all his classmates were on board. Some fellow students preferred the traditional Chinese music that their teacher, Master Ren GuangYi, typically played, and asked for Reed’s tape to be turned off. One student walked out the door and never came back. (Reed’s drone music always did have a polarizing effect on listeners.)But Reed and Ren kept playing the tape, and according to Anderson, anyway, some of his classmates eventually came around, saying that it was the best tai chi music they’d ever heard. One wonders to what extent Reed’s fame—or perhaps simply his legendary stubbornness—greased the wheels. In an amusing anecdote in the liner notes, yoga instructor Eddie Stern says that when he worked with Reed, “Whether we were doing yoga or meditating, the Hudson River Wind Meditations came on, and even though I am a silent meditator and don’t normally recommend listening to music when meditating, I would let it slide for Lou.”The bulk of the release is taken up by two long tracks offering markedly different visions of what ambient music could be. The opening “Move Your Heart” is the more minimal of the two. It consists of a single oscillating tone, or cluster of tones, that opens and closes, over and over, for nearly 29 minutes, with very little evident variation. Rooted in a bassy throb, it begins throwing off sparks as a growling, high-resonance filter combs through the frequencies; for a brief moment, it’s a softly reassuring major triad, and then the filter clamps down once again, grinding everything into the rumbling muck. The cycle moves like waves, or breathing, yet despite its seeming steadiness, the repetition is never quite exact, and that almost imperceptible sense of uncertainty heightens its power. You never know quite what the music is going to do next, even though it never really does anything. It’s calming yet never fully subdued: The piece seems to move with a life of its own, and its raw, unburnished sonics feel far away from the politeness of more placid relaxation music. At times, as the bass tones thicken and congeal, it feels downright unruly.",Rock,8.4
526,"With a lavish new album, the Colombian American singer serves up lush ballads about protecting your peace and sizzling reggaeton to disturb it. In the video for “Te Mata,” a highlight from her resplendent new album Orquídeas, Kali Uchis embodies the ritual cruelties and delights of life as a femme fatale. The visual is grainy and textured, unmistakably Almodóvarian with its vivid, saturated color palette, high drama, and vintage glam. She vamps in an ivory, crystal-encrusted mermaid gown. She throws a cordless phone handset through a window. She shoves glass bottles off a table in a fit of rage. She cries a single tear in a baby-blue robe and matching lace bra, her eyes framed by immaculately feathered lashes. She chuckles when an anonymous hand presses a revolver to her forehead.“Te Mata” is a supreme example of Uchis’ gift for crafting universes of revenge, infatuation, and sorrow. As she’s released more Spanish-language music in recent years, including her 2020 LP Sin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios) ∞, Uchis has sharpened that vision, securing chart hits along the way. On Orquídeas, she writes another instruction manual for baddie behavior, where women are encouraged to stuff toxic exes into the trunks of their cars and loaf the day away in red-glitter bustiers and platform heels. But the album is also a reflection of the capaciousness of diasporic music. Despite the overwhelming commercial success of bilingual artists of Latin American descent, our corporate music industry overlords still find it impossible to believe a major label singer might thrive making original music in both Spanish and English. Like Selena Quintanilla before her, Uchis proves them wrong.Much of Orquídeas reprises the shimmering daydreams Uchis is known for, luxuriating in background harmonies and synth arpeggios that feel like they’re enveloped in charmeuse fabrics. “Young, Rich & in Love,” “Diosa,” and “Perdiste” were designed to play in the background while you bathe in a clawfoot tub full of milk and rose petals. “Heladito” is a lovely return to form; longtime fans will recognize the doo-wop melodic sensibility and pure longing of Uchis’ 2015 Por Vida EP—though she nods to a new era, singing, “No soy pop star pero si soy internacional.”The first third of the record is so uniformly luxurious that the songs are almost hard to distinguish. But the synth-pop glitter bomb “Igual Que Un Ángel” is a beaming exception, its cherubic hook a sure shot for TikTok virality. Over a funky bassline and prismatic chimes, Uchis and the mulleted corrido prince Peso Pluma sing about a woman who never falls prey to superficial love. Pluma’s nasal vocal tones layer effortlessly over the groove, unlocking a new superpower. Uchis’ vocal performance across the record represents a leap forward too: 12 years ago, she possessed the more limited—but still soulful—range of a lounge singer; now she stretches her voice to a fluttering whistle register on “¿Cómo Así?”",Pop,8.4
527,"The Buffalo rapper sticks largely to hard-boiled genre conventions, while German beatmaker Wun Two leans toward the abstract and atmospheric. It’s tempting, in the aftermath of Westside Gunn’s purported swan song And Then You Pray for Me, to consider Griselda’s dissolution. Gunn is now, by his own account, more interested in fashion and moguldom than recording or performing—the Art Basel crowd, it happens, has little use for Trap-A-Holics tributes. His half-brother Conway the Machine, meanwhile, is still rapping like the rent’s due. The group’s most accomplished and pragmatic technician, Conway offsets sleek major-label outings with austere works for hire, his sprawling solo catalog eschewing a neat trajectory. He cuts hard-boiled tapes with neighbors, unsung DJs, and streetwear brands, a master sculptor insisting upon the bluntest of tools.Conway sticks largely to genre conventions on Palermo, although producer Wun Two makes a valiant effort to break the mold. A German beatmaker best known for his lo-fi instrumental projects, Wun Two conjures an assured, hypnotic mood reminiscent of DJ Muggs. Where past collaborators Big Ghost Limited and the Alchemist outfitted Conway with ornate samples, Wun Two foregrounds distinctive percussion, washing his drum patterns with isolated chords and hazy stereo effects. On “Carduni,” ambient cymbals approximate uncanny static; a delicate melody sneaks in around the halfway point of “Mind Tricks,” propelling the track forward while maintaining its creeping tension.A series of interludes embellishes the ambience with a transatlantic drug trafficking theme, but Wun Two’s cues are lost in translation. Conway stays close to home, his tales of ascendance—I used to do X, now I do Y—often confined to individual couplets. The anecdotes range from amusing (“Look, we was baggin’ all day to serve in the spot/We had shit jumpin’ like Shawn Kemp’s vertical hops”) to obligatory (“Used to bag ounces up in twenties, I would scrape the plate/Chop until the razor break, look, they say he great”), his rhyme patterns rigid and monosyllabic. The performance is buoyed by Conway’s instincts, which are, as ever, exceptional. He stretches his limbs in whitespace, lounging in the drawn-out chorus of “Carduni,” extending the outros of “Mind Tricks” and “Bianca” into ad-libbed monologues.There’s precious little rapping on Palermo—most tracks feature a single verse with padding on either side—and Wun Two relishes the lack of structure, his unhurried tempos blooming into roomy instrumental breaks. In lieu of quotables, he centers the performers’ expressive quirks: Conway’s Heath Ledger-as-Joker cackle does as much lifting as the sinewy rhymes. Fellow Buffalo native Goosebytheway is an invaluable supporting player, warbling raspy hooks like a grizzled 50 Cent. Still, the tasting-course format imposes a low ceiling. The diffuse jazz-club instrumentals on “Cold Dish” are among the album’s most evocative, yet Conway seems to lose interest midway through a sparse 16 bars. Goose bookends the verse with a loose chorus, but it plays like a reference track, more of a teaser than a song.",Rap,6.6
528,"On a disorienting and adventurous new album, the Mexico City hardcore band raises hell in pursuit of a better world. When Malcría scrawled “What the fuck do you want?” in Spanish across an early EP, the title was less an insult than an invitation: They raised the question with the goal of kindling listeners’ determination. Malcría come from a long line of hardcore bands that find bottomless energy within their anger, and since breaking onto Mexico City’s scene in 2014, the trio has scoffed and stomped and screamed in pursuit of a better world. Lately, their anger spawns from the recognition that the future their generation was promised no longer exists.On Fantas​í​as Hist​é​ricas, their second album, Malcría try to imagine a reality where misery and paranoia can be escaped, but they find the task impossible. Singer-bassist Baldo Crudo, guitarist Alan Di González, and singer-drummer GG Androide drop right in on opener “Una Vez Más,” warning that decadence and blind devotion have led us astray. A flurry of D-beat drumming and Crudo’s yelped vocals morph through tempo change-ups, a hair metal guitar solo, and excerpts from the Spanish dub of John Carpenter’s In the Mouth of Madness. On “El Monumento,” Androide admits his fight against the status quo is in vain: He’s growing older and more fragile each day, just like everyone else. By the time he acknowledges there’s a limit to his romanticism on “Utop​í​a y Fracaso”—“No tiene caso imaginar una sociedad donde no haya mal/El mundo ideal es irreal” (“There’s no point in imagining a society where there is no evil/The ideal world is unreal”)—he’s already scratched his throat trying to scream it into existence.Malcría write their lyrics as a group, and Crudo and Androide take turns singing them. Throughout Fantas​í​as Hist​é​ricas, their voices stab each word with the rhythmic motion of a tattoo machine. The two spit out warnings and twist vowels with a similarly charred tone; panic and fear have a way of reducing us to equals. The dynamic interplay between their ever-so-slightly different vocals only adds to the album’s disorienting rush. While they don’t adhere to nihilism per se, Malcría find little comfort in ideas like personal liberty or even work-life balance. If you don’t ignore these sources of false hope, the band warns, you’ll get sucked into a black hole. “Toda fantasía tiene su precio” (“Every fantasy has its price”), Crudo reminds on the title track, as Di González shreds with thunderous volume and the muddy, crunchy distortion of grunge. On closer “Todo Es Aquí,” Malcría barrel over the finish line with synchronized riffs that sound like Rudimentary Peni overlaid with Poison Idea. At a whopping three minutes, it’s by far the longest song on the record.",Rock,7.2
529,"After circulating underground for five years, the rapper’s new project recaptures the magic of his late 2010s glory. In July of 2018, 03 Greedo reported to a Texas prison to begin serving a 20-year sentence related to drug and firearm charges incurred during a 2016 traffic stop. The Watts, California rapper had always been prolific: From the start of 2016 through the beginning of his sentence, he released seven LPs, three of which clocked in around 90 minutes, while two more ran two hours apiece. But in the weeks leading up to his incarceration, he recorded at an even more astonishing pace, summoning collaborators from around Los Angeles to various studios at all hours of the day and night.Many of the songs written during this period have since been released, usually on projects helmed by a single producer. These records occasionally recall Greedo at his elastic best, folding and stretching into ridiculous shapes to accommodate the disparate sounds he loves to synthesize: bounce from Baton Rouge and New Orleans, warbled singing from Atlanta, scuttling claps from his city’s own strip clubs. Still, they all rest on a shelf below his pre-prison material, perhaps because it often feels like there are too many people in the room. Though he has turned in scorched-earth guest verses on other rappers’ songs, Greedo’s music is strongest when it hermetically seals you inside his psyche—when each interpolation or irrupting confession feels unmediated, unedited, and raw. Of all the music he’s released since he began serving his sentence, Project T-Pain comes closest to recapturing the sorcery of his 2016-18 run.Created during that period—and circulated subterraneously as a .zip file for more than five years now—the finally released album also pairs him with a single producer, this time LA’s Dnyc3. But whether it’s due to the more considered sequencing, more wrenching writing, or a less idiosyncratic collaborator (for better or worse, it is impossible to hear a Mustard beat and think of anyone else), the comparatively brief set feels like it flows directly from one man’s hyperactive brain.On the second song from 2017’s Purple Summer 03: Purple Hearted Soldier, Greedo noted his trips in and out of lockup with a sly joke. “I might freestyle this whole album,” he teases, “‘cause I hate the pen.” But Project T-Pain opens with a much starker vision of the incarceration he faced at the time he wrote it. “You ever rode inside a bucket van?” he asks on the sweeping “Stronger,” where he invites the listener to imagine being “shackled from your hands and your feet.” A few bars later—before Dnyc3’s drums have even kicked in—Greedo laments experiencing homelessness before finding success, only to realize that he won’t beat the case in front of him. It’s the sort of bloodletting that would usually be reserved for an album’s end; by slotting it at the very front, the stakes of every encounter with an enemy or squad car that follows feel impossibly high.",Rap,8.0
530,"The Minnesota rapper’s blurry, distorted tracks conceal downhearted emotion, half-told stories, and irreverent humor. In case you haven’t heard, things have been really noisy in rap’s underground lately. The beats are full of distortion and clipping 808s, the vocals submerged in gunk—it’s music that can often sound like you have the volume cranked up in multiple tabs at the same time. This isn’t anything new for Lerado Khalil. For a few years now—especially since dropping the deep-fried EP CDQ in 2020—the St. Paul, Minnesota artist has been experimenting with a bugged-out, trancey style that feels like being sucked down a wormhole in slow motion. It isn’t just chaos for chaos’ sake: All the fuzz and blurriness collides with a monotone delivery that falls somewhere between the exploratory ambling of Black Kray and the inner monologuing of IDLSIDGO Earl to create droopy mood pieces like his latest album, Dog Days.Dog Days sounds like one of those manga panels splattered with thwacks and cracks, though what’s actually happening inside the character’s head is a lot quieter. On the intro, Lerado and Virginia producer GAWD generate overpowering, blown-out rhythms that could shake stone, while his raps are buried underneath. Behind a bonkers 14 Golds beat on “Thats a Set,” Lerado doesn’t quite sound sad as he stitches together murky, pitched-down thoughts—just a little humdrum and gloomy. Even so, it’s not that serious. On the madhouse “Whatsapp,” he interpolates Kreayshawn’s time capsule “Gucci Gucci” and makes the anthemic “One big room full of bad bitches” sound so droll. I would listen to an entire mixtape of his dazed spins on nostalgic internet hits.Lerado’s own lyrics are intentionally difficult to decipher, when they’re possible to decipher at all. That’s not necessarily a problem, because his music is much more about the feeling than the words, but in some cases it’s not enough. “Mission” is heavily distorted but generic, missing that fine coat of dust that makes the rest of the songs feel like they’ve been ripped from a cassette. And “White Lie” loses touch with the album’s sense of internal soul-searching because it feels more like guest Harto Falión’s song than Lerado’s.When Dog Days works, more often than not it reminds me of listening to MIKE’s slice-of-life raps, or early, coming-of-age Lucki: rappers who make it feel like you know them better than people you speak to in real life. It’s just a lot noisier. Think of “Fine Line”: Lerado’s flow is bleary and muffled and Savedher and Jacob Rochester’s instrumental contains it like a lid over a pot of boiling water, yet the melancholy and regret feels clear. Midway through “Bandcamp,” the beat (by Osyris Israel) starts flickering like a dead lighter and it only heightens Lerado’s scatterbrained headspace. And every now and then, a bar will pierce through the mess, like the repetition of “Sent a text when I should’ve called” on “Can’t Come Back.” It’s only a few words, but set your imagination loose and it turns into an entire story.",Rap,7.4
531,"Using a canvas of cosmic synth arpeggios and hissing electronics, the Colombian artist treats folk music as a living entity imbued with liberatory potential. A Flor de Piel, the new album from Colombian artist Montañera, cultivates clarity from communion. You can hear blunted traces of the country’s folk music across the record, but “Como Una Rama” is one of the album’s clearest summonings. At first, only her elastic vocals hang in the air, stretching and sprawling into the thickness of the atmosphere. Her voice starts reverberating into echoes, as if a chorus of ancestral spirits have joined her. Here, Montañera sings in the tradition of bullerengue, a folk style of music and dance developed by maroon communities (enslaved Africans who escaped bondage and formed their own settlements) on the Caribbean coast of her homeland. Before long, her voice short-circuits, glitching into ripples of fuzz, like a spotty radio transmission. All that’s left in the haze is the steadfastness of her voice.A Flor de Piel transmits centuries of cultural memory, but the hissing electronics and serene synth arrangements transform the music into more than mere homage. The album chronicles stories of rebirth, transformation, and self-discovery, often via the purifying and regenerative motifs of water and flora. But even though María Mónica Gutiérrez’s journey is personal, her muted interpolations of folk styles suggest there is abundant knowledge in community-based traditions. A Flor de Piel is not just a sublime example of folkloric reinterpretation; it’s also a treatise on the liberatory gestures that are possible when you reimagine musical genealogy. In Montañera’s fluid chronal continuum, folk music isn’t an ancient artifact, but a living, breathing entity that was always meant to free us.Take “Santa Mar,” which features Cankita (from the group Bejuco) and Las Cantadoras de Yerba Buena, a group of traditional musicians from Colombia’s Pacific coast, led by women from Tumaco. The track is an offering to an aquatic deity whose holy water possesses cleansing and life-giving properties. On it, speckled marimbas de chonta and orotund vocals, sung in the style of currulao, are shepherds for cycles of life and death. A repeated chant renders the practice of singing as a conduit for renewal: “Listen to my song, which comes and goes from the water/Wetting the earth so that new life may grow.” While pursuing her master’s degree, Gutiérrez studied vocal traditions from the Colombian Pacific coast, investigating how singing can be a tool for peace-building in the aftermath of violent conflict. Though other songs on A Flor de Piel only gesture at this kind of healing, in its lyrics, “Santa Mar” is a literal declaration of folk music’s curative capacities.",Electronic,8.0
532,"On the follow-up to her 2020 debut, the Tunisian producer flips trap samples and lounge jazz into idiosyncratic, blissed-out footwork and club music. “Hammam Lif Footwork,” reads an underlined message on the back flap of Slime Patrol, Khadija Al Hanafi’s 2020 debut cassette release. The tagline refers to one of the northernmost towns in the producer’s native Tunisia, named for its historic baths and hot springs. The geotag is important. Though footwork and juke are intrinsically linked to their Chicago roots—even as the genres have spawned regional movements in Tokyo, Poland, and the United States’ coastal metropolitan areas—Al Hanafi belongs to a more recent wave of practitioners, like Pennsylvania’s Nondi_, who approach the genre from a headphone-oriented, autobiographical perspective.Bolstered by a collaborative cut with Teklife’s DJ Earl, the inaugural Slime Patrol tape was as relaxing and steamy as a sauna session, maintaining footwork’s bass-driven pulse while placing heightened importance on melody and texture. Tracks like “Mnaïch’alik” and “Moulaga” wove field recordings and trap a cappellas into dusty jazz chops that would feel at home on a Madlib beat tape, percolating for just over a minute before transitioning into the next cut for a continuous mix-like experience. Over its brief 20-minute runtime, the album established Al Hanafi’s uniquely poetic voice as a producer. Each song was as intimate and ephemeral as memory itself.Slime Patrol’s sequel, which arrived on January 1, 2024, is also a bricolage of cozy lounge loops, but its inspirations are more varied, and Al Hanfi has nixed the seamless segues in favor of quick fadeouts, allowing her to expand her rhythmic palette. She molds Jersey club in her own image on “Rounia,” stretching out a dreamy canvas of saxophone and electric keys that tastefully muffles her choice of percussion. The genre’s typical gun-cocking samples are pitched up and layered into flurries of cochlea-tickling clicks that sound excerpted from an Alva Noto record, and soft tufts of 808 bass create the sensation of floating. You can dance to the beat, but the song’s nebulous shape is even more conducive to blissful dissociation. Listening feels like being suspended in jelly, unsure which way is up. “Throwsom$,” on the other hand, is a study in footwork’s ghetto-house roots, emulating its gritty hedonism beneath impressionist piano glissando. Even at its rawest, Slime Patrol 2 is still dripping in elegance.The most thrilling moments of the first Slime Patrol stemmed from Al Hanafi’s extensive sampling of 2010s rap, particularly on “&iLovemyloot,” which fused Playboi Carti’s chorus from “Shoota” with a twangy standup bass riff and warped the final product into a psychedelic haze. The same is true for Slime Patrol 2, which opens with a celebration of Waka Flocka Flame’s trademark ad-libs. Though pairing Flocka’s manic imitations of gunfire with dainty jazz flute risks sounding gimmicky, Al Hanafi rearranges her source material so self-assuredly that it transcends novelty. Flocka’s voice flickers in and out of the mix, sometimes shuffled with a short, nicely contrasting R&B vocal run. “2TwinDracos” fast-forwards an excerpt from Lil Keed’s “Anybody” into near unintelligibility over skittering jungle breaks and what sounds like a vintage city-pop sample. It’s a pure sugar rush, punctuated by breakneck detours into trap production.",Electronic,7.5
533,"The Bolivian American artist formerly known as Elysia Crampton spins Andean music, digital effects, and overwhelming distortion into a binary-smashing collage with ecstatic overtones. Chuquimamani-Condori’s gloriously fractured music mashes the mundane with the divine, leaving every jagged seam lovingly exposed. As Elysia Crampton, E+E, and now using their Aymara name, the Bolivian American experimental producer has woven cumbia, tarqueada, huayño, and other Andean folk and dance styles into splintered collages pierced by white-noise blasts, electronic rhythms, and hyper-compressed digital bass. Beyond simply invoking these genres, they capture a sense of their passage through the world—as if their muffled rhythms were blasting out of an overdriven PA system in the park, or ripped from an online mix with the ads still intact. Chuquimamani-Condori treats these sounds as a breathing social organism, an animated embodiment of traditional music as it lives today.After a handful of releases like ORCORARA 2010 and Selected Demos & DJ Edits [2007-2019] that presented the disparate building blocks of Chuquimamani-Condori’s music at their rawest, DJ E dazzlingly rejoins the pieces. Dropped onto Bandcamp with little fanfare toward the end of last year, it feels like a full-circle moment for Chuquimamani-Condori; like 2018’s self-titled album or their mesmerizing 2015 debut, American Drift, it could never be mistaken for the work of another artist. It is simultaneously harrowing yet warm, deathly urgent yet defiantly playful. Though everything from the album’s low-key release to its proudly unmastered sound may seem to undercut its significance, Chuquimamani-Condori’s rejection of industry norms only serves to highlight the vitality of the music.The first thing you may notice about DJ E is just how busted it sounds. Chuquimamani-Condori stacks one ultra-compressed layer on top of another, their claustrophobic mixing only heightening the music’s intensity. “The older I get, the uglier I want my music to feel,” they told Tiny Mix Tapes in 2015, arguing that clean, self-consciously futuristic sound design is rooted in a colonialist “mode of educated whiteness.” By that metric, DJ E is Chuquimamani-Condori’s most violent rebellion yet: “Forastero Edit” skitters with sword-drawing stock effects and stop-start guitar from their brother Joshua Chuquimia Crampton (whose own ultra-minimal music has paralleled Chuquimamani-Condori’s over the last few years). “Return” buries its pleading siku panpipes in a blown-out fog of throbbing bass and crunched-up distortion, in what feels like trying to glimpse sunlight through a sandstorm. It’s not that far off from the disorientation caused by the weirder end of Brazilian funk, a kind of hypnosis only made possible by the sound of plug-in bass presets clipping out of control.",Experimental,8.0
534,"The Korean electronic duo’s music is a curious world of bright colors, aqueous burbles, and even one otherworldly pop song. Salamanda’s colorful, luminous electronic music started as a fantasy. Korean producers Sala (aka Uman Therma) and Manda (aka Yetsuby) told Crack in early 2022 that they hoped, through making songs, to retreat from the drudgery of modern life to the imaginary worlds they dreamed up when they were kids. It’s a feeling that their records over the last few years—playfully impressionistic, full of sunny synth melodies and an unrelenting spirit of curiosity—vividly evoke.Their latest, In Parallel, is a vibrant expansion of these themes. The title of the first track, “Nostalgia,” might feel obvious for a duo whose music has mined the feeling so thoroughly. But it fits this foggy composition, which opens with the distant chatter of children playing, eventually fading into lapping synthesizer melodies and featherlight percussion. Its familiar, golden-hour emotionality makes for the sort of song that feels like a warm memory the first time you hear it.Salamanda are most comfortable inhabiting this mode—In Parallel is bright and elaborate but unfolds at a contemplative pace. Their approach recalls the ornate records Jon Hassell was making toward the latter part of his career, or the intricate emotionality found on labels like West Mineral Ltd.; there is movement and momentum on In Parallel, but Salamanda always find space for stillness. Even on tracks that foreground percussion and rhythm, like the sleepwalking balearic murmurs of “Sun Tickles” or the aqueous burbles of “Purple Punch,” In Parallel’s movement is patient. It oozes slowly, shimmering like motor oil in rainwater.On 2022’s Ashbalkum, the duo found a lot of power in the playful potential of the human voice, splashing wordless coos across the record. They use vocals in similarly abstract ways on In Parallel, including the gasping title track, which smears ghostly syllables across gently pooling electronics—underscoring the yearning that pulses beneath the record’s more abstract moments. But In Parallel’s most striking moment takes a different approach. While still oozy, otherworldly, and surreal in its own right, “Homemade Jam” pushes the limits of Salamanda’s sound by offering up what’s effectively a pop song. The lyrics are simple, little more than a nursery rhyme—“Make a jam/By myself”—but the track is sticky and sweet. There’s nothing else like it among In Parallel’s pensive pieces, but roughly hewn as it is, it’s genuinely memorable—part schoolyard chant, part radio hit beamed in from Candy Land.Salamanda’s music is often broadly understood as ambient, but they’ve never been circumscribed by such borders. Peaceful moments abound in their catalog, but whenever things get too tranquil, a slithering rhythm or a surreal vocal melody stands ready to add a mischievous slipperiness. The freedom and genuine curiosity of their approach is what has made the group so exciting to follow across their recent productive years. Call them ambient if you must, but Salamanda aren’t drifting—they’re exploring, like wide-eyed wanderers turned loose on a brand new realm.",Electronic,7.1
535,"Where the South Korean singer, songwriter, and producer’s deep house is laid-back and breezy, her rapping is quietly, coolly defiant. South Korean songwriter, singer, and producer 박혜진 Park Hye Jin’s style might be described as “casual confrontation.” Despite the smoothness of her burnished deep house, she is aggressively matter-of-fact about who she is and what she stands for. One of her earliest singles was called “I DON’T CARE,” after all. But her self-released new album, Sail the Seven Seas, suggests that she’s had a rough time of late. Life on the road—years of touring combined with moves from Seoul to Melbourne, London, and Los Angeles—heightened her self-reliance and intensified her loneliness. Despite its summery vibes, Sail the Seven Seas is often stormy going, venturing into choppy emotional waters that occasionally leave her adrift in her feelings.Park’s best work has surfed between twinkling house melodies and ruthlessly intense drums. Her style is both distinctive and versatile, folding in disparate genre experiments while always highlighting her signature instrument: her voice. Park’s monotone can be inventive: singing, rapping, spitting, and sighing her lyrics to both dreamy and punishing effect. On a song like “Can you,” the interplay between the pulse of her infatuation and the undertow of her contempt felt panoramic, a portrait of a woman in deep romantic conflict.So far, though, she hasn’t quite been able to hold a song together with her voice alone. Park falls into this trap at several points on Sail the Seven Seas, where scaled-back production leaves her already shaky vocals painfully front and center. The title track’s lyrics are emotionally naked, but the wistful piano is musically inert, failing to transport her wish-in-a-bottle longing anywhere at all. Her voice is better served when it’s employed as a percussive tool. She tears into her verses with gusto on “Bklyn Babe” and “Sex on the Beach,” which feature some of her best rapping to date. But she undercuts that versatility by too often falling back on blunt-force repetition. The annoyance and desperation implied in the hook of “Tryna Get to over You” doesn’t come through in her disaffected chant, and though “N.Y.C.” features some cool sonic detailing, her mantra-like loop (“New York City… New York City…”) falls flat.After her previous forays into footwork, techno, and trap, Sail the Seven Seas folds chillwave into Park’s repertoire. Synths flare and fade like sunsets on “Foreigner,” while a dusky guitar riff opens up Park’s leapfrogging verses on “Bklyn Babe.” These tropical accents are a vehicle for some fraught emotions. Frustration is a major theme, and throughout the album, Park addresses a litany of slights and insults in funny, plainspoken language. On “Foreigner,” she recounts the indignities of the immigration process in a venomous deadpan: “Let me get a green card, I don’t want to marry you! I don’t need you for a green card! I’m fucking talented!” The stupidity of the hurdles that Park has to put up with calls for a sharp rebuke, and she delivers.As satisfying as it can be to hear Park light into rude employees, border stooges, clueless suits, and racist assholes, one longs for the artist to find some sense of safety and security so that she’s not constantly on the defensive. Her greatest work reconciles hardness and softness, strength and vulnerability. The penultimate track, “California,” fuses a rollicking drum break with breezy G-funk synths, making full use of her talents as a rapper, and ends with a call-and-response in Korean that she answers for herself: “Who’s the one? I’m the one.” Whether this self-produced, self-released album is meant as a career reset or a way of marking time between bigger projects, Sail the Seven Seas is a reminder that Park doesn’t take directions from anyone.",Electronic,6.6
536,"On her debut full-length, the Hanoi conceptualist sings of youthful heartache over glitched-out, sub-rattling beats. Aprxel (pronounced “april”) might be your favorite drainer’s favorite drainer. On her debut full-length tapetumlucidum<3, the Hanoi singer-songwriter’s voice bleeds into distorted, collage-like productions by Pilgrim Raid (aka Long Trần). Both are members of Mona Evie, a collective of young artists flourishing in the city’s underground music scene. The album is also a showcase of fellow Hanoian conceptualists, like noise wrangler Tran Uy Duc and sound artist Lý Trang, who produced Aprxel’s first EP AM, PM. While the sample-based, deep-fried maximalism of peers like Jane Remover and Rắn Cạp Đuôi often approaches hyperactivity, Trần’s productions saunter through glitched-out cyberspace as Aprxel’s smoky voice floats above the din. Amid the overstimulation and memey undertones of the current landscape, tapetumlucidum<3 is refreshingly heartfelt and grounded.While post-TikTok attention spans have encouraged many bedroom artists to shorten the runtime of their tracks, Aprxel sings over instrumentals that meander and unravel into oblivion. “va’ng9999” begins with a dreamy interpolation of Little River Band’s “Reminiscing” that gradually gets chopped and screwed, eventually surrendering to a wall of fuzz laid down by Lưu Thanh Duy of shoegaze outfit Nam Thế Giới. The noisy four-on-the-floor of “two” takes a left turn into swingy 2-step garage, while on “planet hollywood,” Aprxel sings over JPEGMAFIA-type beats that disintegrate into spiraling sax lines. When a minimalist dembow riddim edges its way in, you have to check whether you’re still listening to the same song.These experiments can be hit-or-miss, but the record’s more straightforward plugg’n’b middle section is a smooth synthesis of Raid’s low-bitrate SoundCloud beats and the midnight melancholy of Aprxel’s harmonies. “cbd” blends grim Memphis stylings with limpid synths, fusing a loop from Gimsim Family’s “Fear No Evil” with saccharine Vietnamese pop balladry. And while she’s rapped for Mona Evie before, Aprxel’s staccato bars on “inanna” feel more self-assured, cutting through Jersey-club bed squeaks.Between the harsh noise of “terrorizers” and the angelic strings of “escape 2 farewell,” only Aprxel’s vocal performance holds Raid’s concoctions together. At times, her voice battles a flood of samples that threaten to drown her out. “cbd” is discordant, akin to Kelela’s infamous detuned 808 on “Closure.” But on “never can say goodbye,” Aprxel’s voice pierces through with startling clarity; on the following track, she puts a little Björk in it, the strings swelling to a poignant peak. Her voice fractures into shard-like vocables in the final section of “escape 2 farewell,” flitting alongside an extended sample of a demo by Kyoto glitch artist sora. Alone in a digital cacophony, Aprxel sings to ease the pain, hoping someone out there is listening. With a knack for adapting to the musical chaos that characterizes her hometown, Aprxel’s voice carries beyond the city; it’s only a matter of time before it’s heard.",Pop,7.0
537,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit a 1978 ambient masterpiece that helped launch the genre through its technological savvy and its soft heart. By January 1975, Brian Eno worked like an electron. He bounded among projects and people, flitting into sessions only long enough to add what Peter Gabriel insisted upon calling “Enossification” to Genesis’ 1974 opus, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. A self-proclaimed non-musician, Eno would appear with his early EMS synthesizer in a briefcase, then wind others’ instruments through it or a panoply of tape recorders, augmenting their sounds with the excitement of the ineffable.Then a free agent just shy of 27, Eno had already become a rock star with Roxy Music. He was the alien razzle-dazzle beauty, sashaying among his electronics and upstaging singer Bryan Ferry until the resulting tension prompted Eno’s exit. Other opportunities abounded, anyway: As he labored over his first two solo albums—obtuse hybrids of high-art idealism and glam-rock strut—he daydreamed about outré ensembles he might start but never did. Luala and the Lizard Girls, for instance, was his plan to pair his catholic sexual enthusiasms with his artistic transgressions. Like many other Eno hypotheticals, it never happened.Though he couldn’t much play the clarinet, he lent his lack of skills (and budding imprimatur) to the Portsmouth Sinfonia, the amateur orchestra of composer Gavin Bryars that mutated the classical repertoire with uncanny allure. He even helped them secure an unlikely record deal. There were his foundational tape-and-guitar improvisations with Robert Fripp, sporadic dalliances with boyhood heroes Nico and John Cale, and his collaborative loyalty to the remaining members of Roxy Music not named Ferry.Around the middle of January 1975, Eno was leaving a session with Roxy guitarist Phil Manzanera, daydreaming about what he’d just played and the sudden uncertainty of his career when he slipped on a drizzly London street. He fell into the path of a speeding black cab. Eno bled from the head and was badly bruised, but he soon returned home from the hospital to convalesce, an electron momentarily at rest.What followed is now, nearly a half-century later, essentially the origin story of ambient music, as riddled with factual uncertainty as all good fables. On her way to visit Eno, Judy Nylon, his former roommate and confidant, bought a cheap album of antique harp tunes near the train station. As Eno lay in his living room, with the rain tinkling against the windows, Nylon put on the record and adjusted the sound to fit the ailing mood. Eno heard his new direction: He wanted to make music like this, sound that could enliven or enhance a space without overpowering it, like a faint stick of incense in the corner or a dim sconce glowing in the distance. Eno now wanted to render the antithesis of the preening rock’n’roll that had made him famous—no glory, only grace.",Electronic,10
538,"In the 1980s, the legendary Bay Area composer self-released her first three albums of roving, curious synthesis. Restored and remixed by master engineer Marta Salogni, they’re collected in a new box set. “My compositions grow as if on canvas,” Pauline Anna Strom once said of her labyrinthine, incandescent music. The San Francisco-based keyboardist was speaking in 1986, when her take on New Age music was still less known, despite three albums already to her name. Trans-Millenia Consort, Plot Zero, and Spectre, released in quick succession in the first half of the ’80s, were rich with undulating, immersive soundscapes inspired by modernists like Brian Eno and Tangerine Dream as much as classical composers like Bach. “I would say my music is virtually dominated by my imagination,” the blind-since-birth musician continued, giving voice to the wellspring of her spacious compositions: a boundless, searching curiosity that touches every part of her music.Why Your Favorite Artists Want Marta Salogni to Mix Their RecordsThe new 4xLP or 4xCD collection Echoes, Spaces, Lines shines a comprehensive spotlight on this period of Strom’s work with reissued versions of those three early albums, plus Oceans of Tears, a previously unreleased album also recorded in the ’80s. The box set follows Angel Tears in Sunlight, the artist’s first LP in over three decades, released posthumously in 2021. Since then, the producer and mixing engineer Marta Salogni, who worked with Strom in her last years, has beautifully restored and remixed Strom’s early work from the original reels. The new compendium, which also marks the release of Strom’s first three albums on streaming, is an essential look at an undersung experimental artist who made strides in the genre ahead of many of her contemporaries.Listening to Echoes, Spaces, Lines, Strom’s rich musical philosophy quickly comes to light. She used nature, spirituality, and legend as guideposts for her roaming music, transforming those themes into curling synthesizer curios and shadowy, abstract compositions. On her first record, 1982’s Trans-Millenia Consort, Strom was drawn to “the metals of the earth,” a poetic description of the album’s resonant, darkly enchanting glow: Highlight “Cult of Isis” opens gently with twinkling harp and eerie ambient whistles, rising and falling alongside a deep drum pattern that thumps like a heartbeat. “Energies” moves faster, building elusive, gliding ribbons of synth and a polyrhythmic beat into one of her liveliest songs. Strom’s music never shifts or peaks in a predictable manner; instead she takes her time, adding color through slight modulation or unanticipated accents, like the blips of 808 on “The Unveiling.” She created the gorgeous, subaqueous “Emerald Pool” by recording the reverberations of water in a ceramic bowl, then layering the sounds with impressionistic vocal and harp melodies. It’s one of her earliest recordings yet easily one of her most accomplished, establishing a wandering sense of play that typified her work.",Electronic,8.3
539,"This set from the Palestinian techno DJ and producer is sleek and rolling, fueled by driving rhythms and punctuated by moments of emotional release. When Sama’ Abdulhadi performs, a range of expressions plays across her face in quick succession: concentration, euphoria, mischief, grace, determination—and sometimes, fleetingly, something like a deep-seated weariness. If dance music is often regarded as a form of liberatory escapism—from drudgery, oppression, trauma—then Abdulhadi might be a spokesperson for escape itself. As the world’s foremost Palestinian techno DJ, a fixture in some of the world’s biggest nightclubs and festivals, she is proof that you can make it out of a system that wants to crush you.Born in Jordan to a family of Palestinian exiles forced out by Israeli authorities who objected to her grandmother’s political activities, Abdulhadi returned to Ramallah as a child and first soaked up local hip-hop (and played for the national soccer team). She then moved to Beirut, where she discovered techno, and then Cairo to study sound design, work as a sound engineer, and DJ throughout the region. Her global breakthrough came in 2018, performing a Boiler Room set from the heart of Ramallah—part of an extensive lineup drawn from the Palestinian underground, including the experimental DJ and producer Muqata’a and the Haifa-based Jazar Crew—that has been viewed more than 12 million times to date. Abdulhadi plays a thoroughly international style of big-room techno, and as a globe-trotting DJ she enjoys a freedom of movement denied to many of her compatriots. (Even on her home turf, however, Abdulhadi has encountered obstacles: In 2020, her performance at a Palestinian mosque triggered a conservative backlash that led her to spend more than a week in jail.) Still, she has always taken pains to center her identity as a Palestinian woman. “It’s a lot of pressure, because I want to represent Palestine perfectly,” she told The Guardian in 2023.Abdulhadi’s fabric presents mix showcases a hard-charging style behind the decks: 73 relentless minutes of throbbing ostinato basslines, sharply carved drums, and glinting synths. The mood is coiled and tense, evoking grinding teeth and clenched fists. She typically mixes in key, layering complementary synths and basslines in call-and-response-like counterpoints, and using syncopated patterns to break up endlessly tumbling four-on-the-floor grooves. Her single “Well Fee,” featuring Palestinian singer Walaa Sbeit, offers a potent distillation of her style: lumbering drums, rattling rhythmic accents, and hypnotic vocals. It’s a glowering, strutting, mean-mugging track that oozes intensity.Melodies rarely extend beyond sullen two-note sequences, and the similarity of Abdulhadi’s selections, combined with her layered style of mixing, means that there are few standout moments. Viennese psytrance producers Psycrain & C.A.T provide a brief moment of contrast with “Goosebombs,” in which the beat drops away to reveal pensive piano and saxophone; it’s a welcome respite from the rhythmic juggernaut. Palestinian-born, Berlin-based producer YA Z AN’s “NADA-R” is another highlight, thanks to its eerie, glistening high end, though it’s overshadowed by the ravier, more synth-heavy tracks that bookend it.",Electronic,7.2
540,"On her latest album, the South Korean singer-songwriter pairs warm, impressionistic lyrics with her most ambitious arrangements yet. Ten years ago, Minhwi Lee performed on South Korean public television with the freak-folk band Mukimukimanmansu, straining her voice as her bandmate Muki destroyed a traditional janggu drum with a hatchet and offered its pieces to a shocked studio audience. Since then, the songwriter and composer has channeled her creative fire into film scores, a jazz trio, and the sludge metal band Gawthrop, for which she occasionally plays bass. Her 2016 solo debut, Borrowed Tongue, combined chamber folk orchestration with a loose narrative around the limits of communication, winning the Korean Music Award for Best Folk Album. Inspired by the poet Theresa Hak Kyung Cha in “Dicteé,” she sang in Korean, “Father, I lost my tongue last night/I cannot even say those words because my mouth is empty.”Recorded after moving back to Seoul in 2019, Hometown to Come, meditates on a different kind of absence. Accompanied by fingerpicked guitar and orchestral sweeps, Lee’s lyrics resemble the poetry of Kim Hyesoon, refiguring emotions into impressionistic parables. Both artists ruminate on the theme of phantom pain: The hometown that Lee remembers feels like an amputated limb that retains sensation, at once a “place that disappeared long ago” and a place where she’s already arrived.Often the emotional payoff rests on lyrical ruptures which invert sadness to reveal warmth. Her language works in the space between opposites: “I find myself thinking of your smile, as you asked about grief/I find myself thinking of your grief, as you searched for a smile,” she sings in Korean, lying in her room alone at night. Resolving the tension—between keys and guitar, comfort and unease—she sends us off with a “goodbye” (“annyeong”). But every “goodbye” can also be a greeting: Lee uses the Korean language to complicate the binaries between escape and pursuit, meeting and separation, sadness and joy that condition our ideas of home.Lee’s arrangements here are some of her most ambitious. On some tracks, there’s a 19-person orchestra that brings her songwriting into the realm of French singers like Françoise Hardy; on others, her classical guitar arpeggios acquire a medieval quality amid Jeseok Jedol Kang’s flute melodies. On “Returning,” she’s accompanied by saxophonist Kim Oki, a prolific collaborator in Seoul’s music scene, who brings out the jazz sensibilities in her songwriting. Lee maintains the melancholy of her early strummy, campfire fare, but she uses the fuller instrumentation to tease out an emotional ambivalence. Listen to how the timbral and melodic claustrophobia of flute and guitar in “Blue Flower” unfolds to reveal a swell of strings at the bass’ gentle guidance, like a projector switching to a wide 16:9 at the beginning of a film screening. And the bass solo that ushers in “The Station” is pure noir, with rhythmic white noise that barely obscures the sound of a speeding train.",Folk,7.6
541,"On its second album, the Australian group strips its melancholy electronic pop down to a whisper, nodding simultaneously to 1980s ennui and 2020s anxiety. Acopia’s melancholy electronic pop is homespun, but it sounds luxurious. Melbourne musicians Kate Durman, Morgan Wright, and Lachlan McGeehan are all pedigreed electronic producers in their own right; their work in this band is minimalist but purposeful, prizing drive and atmosphere even when the music is at its sparsest. A solitary horn pierces the electronic gloom on “We Evolve,” the opener of their self-titled second album, and it evokes the image of vocalist Durman as the dame in a film noir, looking out onto a rainy street for some shred of hope amid the gloom.Acopia specialize in songs about loneliness and isolation. Throughout, Durman sings as if she were a ghost wandering among the living, her quiet, breathy voice often lying like a layer of mist between ominous post-punk guitars and icy programmed drums. “Acopia” is a medical term describing an inability to cope with daily life, and the lyrics here live up to that moniker. On “Be Enough,” Durman drifts through a party scene, her lyrics an endless stream of unanswered questions and pregnant pauses; on “Eyes Shut,” dissociation “feels like a drug” amid emotional strife. This is pop music for absentee friends and serial ghosters, where the lines, “I take you for granted/It’s just what I do, ooh” ring out like a singalong chorus.Although that may sound ponderous on paper, Acopia is charged with tension. The band builds on its 2022 debut, Chances, a record of catchy, fragile songs set to altogether bolder and more forceful production, by making everything a little more muted. Acopia are one of a handful of groups in Melbourne that clearly worships at the altar of HTRK, a band that looms large in Australia’s experimental scene; on this record, Acopia smartly follow their lead in stripping their sound down to a whisper. This subtler palette yields a record that’s more dynamic than Chances. “Eyes Shut,” the album’s centerpiece, breaks through the fugue state like a battering ram. Powered by unrelenting sub-bass and McGeehan’s thundering drumming, it feels like the onset of the anxiety attack that’s been slowly building over the course of the record, a slow suffocation.Acopia are hardly alone in specializing in feel-bad electronic pop, but they do feel especially 2020s in their outlook. Durman seemingly has every possible ultra-therapized line in her arsenal—“I need to zoom out,” “Maybe we could take it at my own pace,” “What is your intention?”—and still seems to feel totally horrible. Although songs like “Holding On” and “Intentions,” which recall classic 4AD bands, nod to romantic melodrama, their lyrical concerns are wan and banal: missed connections, miscommunications, listless interactions. Set against the band’s rich, nervy environments, this glazed-over, alienated tone makes for a record that’s both intimate and intense, dazed and direct—hardly a cure for modernity, but something that makes it easier to cope all the same.",Electronic,7.4
542,"In a Fluxus-inspired work for saxophone, drums, and string quartet, the New York-based musician strikes a boisterous balance between composition and free improv. “I always want my music to have that quality where things seem familiar but different,” New York saxophonist Darius Jones said recently. “Like when you remember something somewhat differently than how it has actually occurred.” Jones executes that plan triumphantly on fLuXkit Vancouver (its suite but sacred), a four-song suite with drummer Gerald Cleaver and four string players from Vancouver, British Columbia. The music echoes Jones’ past work as well as the avant-garde jazz that has informed his oeuvre. But there is always something new going on; sometimes it seems as if the music had changed since the last time you listened.fLuXkit Vancouver’s fascinatingly amorphous quality comes in part from Jones’ interest in Fluxus, an art movement from the 1960s and 1970s that emphasized event-based works where the process was as important as the outcome. Sometimes an individual Fluxus piece would include a “fluxkit,” a box containing a score, instructions, and everyday objects, all intended for use in performance. Jones considers the album’s cover art, liner notes, and score, which combines traditional and graphic notation, to be just such a fluxkit. His goal was to mix media into something, as he put it, “where art and music meet.”You don’t have to have access to his entire fluxkit to appreciate Jones’ vision. The four pieces here equitably combine composition and improvisation, placing the act of conception on the same plane as the act of performance. It’s all there in the opening track, “Fluxus V5T 1S1,” which starts with Jones in a prayerful mode, playing slow, heavy tones over Cleaver’s snare and the reverent sounds of violinists (and brothers) Jesse Zubot and Josh Zubot and cellist Peggy Lee. Soon, Cleaver inserts a beat that’s followed briskly by James Meger’s stair-climbing bass, and the ensemble coalesces around that structure. But Jones doesn’t join them, instead breaking out with a contrasting theme, delivering a multi-layered performance that’s both razor-sharp and unbounded.An aura of indeterminacy continues throughout fLuXkit Vancouver, but don’t mistake it for indecision. This is a fearless, even boisterous record, with Jones’ penetrative playing matched solidly by everyone on his team, especially Cleaver and Lee. “Zubot” is named for the two violinists, both of whom contribute mightily, but the drummer and cellist steer the ship, slapping and sawing a course for Jones to sail through. Cleaver’s tom-led rolls set the tone for “Rainbow,” an 18-minute journey that includes a strikingly minimalist bass solo from Meger, and a few rushes of all-together crescendo that evoke Charles Mingus’ most assertive ensemble works.",Jazz,7.7
543,"The Portland power-pop artist covers a set of previously unreleased Jon Brion recordings that showcases the producer/composer’s underrated songwriting chops. “Why finish a song when you can start a new one?” Jon Brion once quipped to the New York Times Magazine. It was 2003, and he was wrapping work on Fiona Apple’s as-yet unnamed third record. Once that was complete, he told the interviewer, he would focus on his own music. A couple years prior, he had self-released his solo debut, Meaningless. The album featured his unshowy mastery of vintage instruments and a compositional sense indebted to the legendary singer/songwriters of ’70s Los Angeles: the exact qualities that had made Brion an in-demand session player, writer, and producer. But his label declined to put it out. Some combination of that experience, his perfectionism, and a steady stream of outside work kept him from ever releasing a follow-up.But new Brion material did appear, in a sense. In 2006, a collection of his demos hit the blogopshere. They were purportedly recorded in 1991 and 1995, before and after he moved to Los Angeles. A loose and lo-fi set of earnest, harmonically sophisticated pop-rock, the demos were revelatory to devotees of what Brion himself termed “unpopular pop.” Portland musician Mo Troper—who first encountered Brion via his hired-gun guitar on Jellyfish’s 1993 cult LP Spilt Milk—is one of those devotees. His latest album, Troper Sings Brion, is a tribute with a twist: These are all songs that Brion never officially released. Troper’s recent output has tended toward deconstruction: 90-second doses of pitch-shifted and saturated power-pop. But here, he plays things mostly straight. Like Harry Nilsson did on the LP that this album’s title and Emma Parry’s cover art riff on, Troper puts his idiosyncrasies in service of the material. In doing so, he posits Jon Brion not as a composer or vibes merchant, but as an L.A. songwriter of the first order.Troper comes out swinging with “Into the Atlantic,” Brion’s sardonic tour of the recording-industry hellscape. There’s no demo recording of this song available, just a few stripped-down live bootlegs, so Troper weaves a pocket symphony around Brion’s quarter-note piano: Harp, Mellotron, and squeezebox dip in and out of the mix. The result would fit snugly on a record by Aimee Mann, who fought the same label battles as Brion in the ‘90s, sometimes alongside him. Here, the song’s ambivalence about its own fate makes it the ideal intro for a set of unreleased tunes: “And when it's time to baptize your own baby/Never mind that dorsal fin/And throw the little morsel in.”",Rock,7.4
544,"The long-running rap supergroup’s comic book-inspired boom-bap is formulaic fun. Whether you prefer the pulpy sci-fi yarns of Deltron 3030, the razor-sharp horrorcore of the Gravediggaz, the Atlanta stomp of Bankroll Mafia, or the moody indie-rap bliss of Madvillain, supergroups used to dominate many corners of rap. They aren’t exactly en vogue at the moment, but Czarface, made up of Wu-Tang Clan’s Inspectah Deck and the Massachusetts duo 7L & Esoteric, persists. Since 2013, the trio has defined itself through mutual loyalty to old-school hip-hop and Silver and Bronze Age comic books. Czarface make hard-nosed, slightly goofy boom-bap for people who can identify Cella Dwellaz deep cuts as readily as the difference between John Romita and Steve Ditko’s work on Spider-Man.Super What?, their 2021 collaboration with the late MF DOOM, was a high-water mark animated by the presence of rap’s greatest supervillain. Czarface’s latest, Czartificial Intelligence, plays out more like a Guardians of the Galaxy-style buddy action-dramedy. This is nerdy dad rap projected through a cel-shaded lens, a batch of average-to-pretty-good songs that don’t take many risks. Over 7L’s samples and dusty drums, Deck and Esoteric’s raps range from clever to lazy. Deck is known for his direct language, an approach that works best when he’s in storytelling mode: On the dark and heartfelt “Sirens,” he awakens to a tragic morning-after and “thugs crying.” That curt style doesn’t translate as well to his punchlines. Half-assed bars like “Taking ’em to class like I’m driving a school bus” (“You Know My Style”) or “It’s Ray’s pizzeria how I serve it to ’em pronto” (“Blast Off”) pale beside his once-earthshaking bars.Esoteric takes bigger lyrical swings and gets wilder results. His style is lighter and his references are more specific, using Golden State Warriors point guard Steph Curry’s mouthguard and motion-capture actor Andy Serkis to big up his rap skills—or shame others’. He isn’t immune to groaners—if I never hear another of his “czar” puns again, it’ll be too soon—but he at least doesn’t take himself too seriously. “Rivalries is short-lived, like dwarves is,” he says on “You Know My Style” before immediately hanging a lampshade on his words: “I take that line back/They couldn’t get it off the track with forklifts.”That keen wit comes in handy on “Mama’s Basement,” a solo track that examines the root of his comic book obsession. Over a steady drum loop and sparkling synths, Esoteric interpolates A Tribe Called Quest’s “I Left My Wallet In El Segundo” as he explains how his love of superheroes endured through a strained relationship with his mother. In the third verse, when he shows up at her place to collect his old back issues, she reminds him that he sold the books years ago and tells him to let go of the past. A Czarface album isn’t usually the place for unpacking trauma, but “Mama’s Basement” fleshes out Esoteric’s personal lore in a novel, even soulful, way.Fresh spins like this are the exception on Czartificial Intelligence: The trio’s routine is solid but formulaic. “Gatecrasher,” which dramatizes a fake beef with fellow rap dweeb Logic and his supervillain alter ego Doc D, feels like an interlude dragged laboriously to feature length. But even when one or both flounder on the mic, Esoteric and Deck complement each other well: an indie-rap mainstay bouncing off the stoicism of a true-school legend. Take “All That for a Drop of Blood,” one of a handful of tracks where every element locks in perfectly. 7L’s beat sounds like an amped-up version of the original PlayStation startup music, Deck reflects sagely on his come-up, and Esoteric fends off biters like he’s fighting his way through The Last of Us. Czarface may be a nostalgia camp with occasional modern flair, but it’s easy to get swept up in the heroics.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

545,"The debut album from the South Carolina producer and singer is a delicate, nourishing statement of ambient, operatic R&B. Janise Robinson spent the pandemic reading a sci-fi novel that encapsulated their feeling of disconnection and left them seeking the comfort of a separate plane of existence—“the permission to imagine leaving,” as a bio notes. Exit Simulation, her first full-length album under the name Niecy Blues, is a layered dream state of prismatic guitar and synths with her strong, floaty harmonies at its nucleus. In a nourishing statement of ambient, operatic R&B, Blues searches for deeper meaning as she stumbles gracefully towards enlightenment in a free-flowing yet focused album that opens up like night-blooming jasmine.The title track is soothing, layers wisping over each other with the delicacy of chiffon; when she sings “I get tired, I get tired,” it’s not a complaint but an observation of serene gentleness, as though she is granting herself leeway to lie down. She exhibits power in softness, small guitar melodies drifting into dub-style drums as she whispers, “It’s easier to lie.” That power resides within their voice and how carefully they can control it. It’s obvious she can sing with brawn when she wants, as she does on “U Care,” but on Exit Simulation she generally keeps her honey tones under an ambient shroud, a measure of restraint that keeps the album on an even keel. “U Care” ends with a sample of what sounds to be a church service, with a man backed by gospel harmonies belts powerfully; she has dedicated the song to her “grandaddy Willie Wrisper who has transitioned out of this earthly plane,” and describes the track as an “exploration of sorrow… of going under… then drowning… then hearing the faintest whisper. I just needed a whisper.”Exit Simulation’s gauzy nature mimics the liminal space of prayer, during which a person appeals to that which cannot be seen, but felt. It is meditative but has explosive moments of joy. “Soma” unfurls into an impressive bit of full-band jazz improv, including vocals and saxophone from the Chicago musician KeiyaA, and gorgeous flute and keyboard trills from Aisha Mars and Qur’an Shaheed, respectively. Through it, she sings a mantra in crescendo: “Easy come, easy go/I want it to flow,” perhaps invoking a Buddhistic songwriting process, and then, “If it’s not meant to be, I’ll allow it to leave and be at peace.”Robinson grew up in a religious home in Oklahoma, “sneaking around and listening to secular music,” and became a musician who has the range and temerity to have played Celie in the musical version of The Color Purple. Though they may have rejected organized religion, as documented in their 2021 track “Bones Become the Trees,” signs of the personally beatific are everywhere. On “Lament,” she crafts a two-minute cavern of echoing synths and then responds with a successive track, “Violently Rooted Reprise,” which shifts the earlier track “Violently Rooted” and presents her angelic voice as a cleansing moment. “I’m still around,” she sighs, then exhales into jubilance; her harmony arrangements sometimes recall those of Elizabeth Fraser (“Exit Simulation”) or Solange Knowles (“1111”), and her penchant for submerging her voice into opaque beats and barely-audible guitar strums is a great argument for gospel and R&B come into the realm of ambient (or ambient’s surer rise in the realm of R&B).It takes a courageous musician to pull off this kind of ambient album, an intimate work excavated from the artist’s interior. On “Analysis Paralysis,” the only song where her vocals are turned up louder in the mix, it’s like she’s letting her subconscious anxiety take over the silence, showing how a person’s doubtful voice can sometimes drown out a quiet confidence. Her voice rasps, and it’s like shooting back into your body after being adrift on the astral plane. By the final track, when she hews to slightly more traditional songwriting structure—verses, chorus, guitar—for what feels like the first time, it’s luxurious, elegant. It’s the sound of transformation—perhaps for Niecy Blues but definitely for the listener.",Experimental,7.9
546,"The moody debut album from the Chicago-born producer is a layered, lo-fi set that ripples with ambient terror. Honour’s sisters were frightened when they first heard his music. “They said it was dark,” the anonymous producer recalled in a recent interview with Crack Magazine. “But it could get a lot darker.” Throughout Àl​á​á​f​í​à, his moody debut album, the PAN-signee parses the loss of his grandmother as well as their shared cultural heritage and spirituality. At times sounding like a series of warbled and crackling FM dispatches, Àl​á​á​f​í​à dips and weaves between jazz, gospel, trip-hop, and subdued rap production. The inclusion of field recordings, burrowed deep into gritty and impressionistic electronic sequences, give a sense of memories smudged by grief.As he puts it, Honour didn’t just record Àl​á​á​f​í​à: He “built and destroyed” it via a time-consuming method that spanned three cities—London, Lagos, and New York. Using a demo version of Ableton, Honour was unable to revisit songs after he initially tracked them. “I’d have to screen-record it then take it back in,” he told Crack. Though arduous, the process yielded a layered, lo-fi effect that leaves the listener in a constant state of anticipation, as if these simmering tracks will boil over at any point.The fluctuating levels and grainy finish of Àl​á​á​f​í​à recall hypnotically dialing between radio stations, likely a nod to Honour’s grandmother, who had one of the first radio shows discussing Itsekiri culture on the Western Nigerian station WNTV. The static that ripples and swells across the album does so like the memory of lost loved ones. But aside from this familial homage, a sense of ambient terror creeps through the core. It manifests in the echoed cackle and motorcycle revs on “Hosanna (Greeting2MYPPL)...” and a loop of kids singing “Ring Around the Rosie” emerging in the middle of “First Born (Redeemed).”The latter song is disrupted by gunfire, a cue for a sudden U-turn; what begins as a shadowy collage of found sounds liquifies and warps into splattered drum fills and pitched-up vocal bursts. The payoff is sublime—if short-lived. A number of songs on Àl​á​á​f​í​à don’t make it past the two-minute mark, but considering their eerie and mournful melodies, it can feel like just the right dosage. “Pistol Poem (Lead Belly)” is a kind of grit-smeared rap that sounds as if it’s been submerged in earth and gravel for a decade. But curving around its rough edges are a weeping sax sample and falsetto coos that could trace their shape across a chapel ceiling.Tracks like “Whip Appeal V6 (PIPN8EZ)” and “U&Me (decemberseventeen),” both built on trappy, trip-hop loops of synth, samples, and percussion, have their own gut-clutching melody at the center. Honour has a knack for these gorgeous, liquid vocal passages, but he contrasts them with sharp, tinny percussion and distortion instead of playing them straight, striking a balance between impressions of beauty, violence, and decay. Àl​á​á​f​í​à is full of field recordings, snippets of sped-up conversations, and references to an artistic pantheon that includes bell hooks, Sun Ra, DMX, Robert Johnson, and Richard Pryor. In a way, Honour tries to examine these themes as an emotional archivist. Collecting life in great, messy heaps, he sifts through the debris and arranges new shapes with the few shining things that can be salvaged.",Electronic,7.6
547,"With tangled riffs and lyrics that read like fridge-magnet poetry, the Baton Rouge duo makes mischievous art punk with a gleefully absurdist spirit. Baton Rouge oddballs SPLLIT make records that clatter and bleep like an arcade crammed with rowdy kids. The duo’s members, known simply as Urq and Marance, approach their tunes like madcap chemists tinkering with acidic formulas. On their debut release, 2019’s XX_HANDLE // SOAR THROAT, Urq and Marance split their duties down the middle; each member penned half of the LP, writing and recording their respective batch of songs in less than a day. On that project, they spotlit their distinct styles—Marance’s skewed art punk, Urq’s scuzzy garage rock—but their music’s wattage only intensifies when their powers are combined. SPLLIT’s impish new LP Infinite Hatch is packed with abstract verses, angular guitars, and an arsenal of animated squeaks and skronks.In under 30 minutes, SPLLIT tear through 12 songs that range from heat-warped indie rock (“Bevy Slew”) to lippy new wave (“Growth Hacking”) to muted psychedelia (“Time Passing Dirge”). The band cites Captain Beefheart, the Fall, Deerhoof, and the Raincoats as inspirations, but you can also pick out traces of the Waitresses, Devo, and DRINKS, Cate Le Bon’s off-kilter duo with Tim Presley. On the wonky outlier “Curtain Lift,” they even recall Leisure-era Blur, slipping bent guitar riffs and hushed drumming under their most fluid vocal melody. But even with all of this input swirling around in their brains, SPLLIT shred and reassemble their influences rather than rubbing off carbon copies.Infinite Hatch’s songs are built like scrappy, neon-flecked collages; some edges are torn, others cut into crisp corners. Their lyrics also can feel snipped from magazine copy and rearranged like effortless fridge-magnet poetry. On “Growth Hacking,” the product of a 45-minute songwriting exercise, Marance blurts out a string of seemingly unrelated words over squiggles of synth and pin-pricking guitar. “Hunch hard shake… change hack rake,” they sing in staccato bursts. The sheer sound of the words outweighs their possible meanings; their harsh consonants land like a heavy chain clunking to the floor, link by link.While writing “Fast Acting Gel,” SPLLIT plucked random idiomatic phrases from the internet for lyrical inspiration. Marance rattles off clichés (“a dime a dozen,” “break a leg”) before decoding them (“something common,” “good luck”). The bluntness of Marance’s definitions makes everyday phrases feel like alien codes. “Shine Sheen” offers a less wordy look into the absurdity of language; amid high-pitched, cartoonish whizzes and digital crickets, SPLLIT refer to talking as a “speech reflex” that occurs despite a “mind body disconnect.” Lines like “Tip over a filing cabinet/Just to scatter all my regrets” only enhance the delightfully bizarre nature of SPLLIT’s dual braintrust. By inverting the mundane and poking around in its detritus, Urq and Marance create a strange haven of their own. It feels at once calculated and lovingly cobbled together.",Rock,7.7
548,"Led by Nicolás Jaar and featuring Angel Bat Dawid, Aho Ssan, Oren Ambarchi, and more, this 2021 performance of collective improvisation is by turns brooding, ecstatic, and surreal. Back in the thick of the pandemic’s first year, with concerts definitively off the table for the foreseeable future, Nicolás Jaar created Weavings as a way of fostering a sense of virtual togetherness. The piece brought together 13 artists from around the world to play together over the internet in real time. Commissioned by Krakow’s Unsound festival, Jaar’s collective improvisation took the form of a round-robin in which successive pairings of players performed overlapping duets. At the end of each segment, one player fell silent while another took their place until the next cue, when a new player joined and another dropped out, etc. Thus they went about “weaving” together their parts in an unbroken exchange of ideas that touched on drone, spiritual jazz, noise, and ambient. For technical reasons, the piece wasn’t streamed as it was played; Jaar recorded each track to disc on separate channels, then spent a feverish 24 hours mixing it down before the 92-minute set was broadcast from the Unsound website.One year later, with concerts back in action, Jaar brought an updated version of the piece to the stage at the 2021 Krakow edition of the festival, recruiting 11 artists—noise musician Aho Ssan, jazz polymath Angel Bat Dawid, experimental vocalist Antonina Nowacka, oud player Khyam Allami, guitarists Oren Ambarchi and Raphael Rogiński, multi-instrumentalist Pak Yan Lau, clarinetist Paweł Szamburski, cellist Resina, hydrophonist Tomoko Sauvage, and drummer Valentina Magaletti—to cycle through a series of seven-minute pairings, with Jaar mixing and dubbing their output while they played. Weavings 2 collects the entirety of that performance in an 84-minute recording that sprawls through a host of different modes and moods, by turns brooding, ecstatic, and surreal.Per its title, the piece unspools like a bolt of cloth being slowly unrolled. Tone is generally secondary to texture: On the rare occasion that melody makes a fleeting appearance, it’s swiftly swallowed by churning waves of rustle and drone. The players favor long sustained tones and slippery harmonizing; percussion, electronics, and noise are primarily vehicles for friction, like fabrics chosen less for their color or heft than for the ways in which they rub together. Even during the busiest moments—like the collective fanfare of the introduction, where five artists play off each other at once—they seem at pains to fuse their voices as one. There’s no showboating.The most exciting passages are those where contrast comes to the fore. In “Pt. 3,” Szamburski teases repeated riffs on his bass clarinet while Dawid sings a wordless, supplicating melody before mashing out dissonant, fist-and-forearm chords on her keyboard. In “Pt. 4,” Dawid alternates between short, tangled bursts of clarinet and vocals that sound like she’s speaking in tongues while Rogiński slashes sideways at his strings. Magaletti and Ambarchi perform an eerie pas de deux, Magaletti’s extended drum rolls and hammered cymbals mirrored in Ambarchi’s trembling streaks of feedback. The album’s most spellbinding moment comes toward the end, as Nowacka’s ghostly vibrato floats mournfully over the patient, melancholy tones of Allami’s oud.",Other,7.5
549,"Seven years after the original, the two rappers deliver a sequel that is unstuck in time, dotted with the vestiges of two bygone eras but imbued with few of those eras’ charms. Here’s something that doesn’t seem like it should be true: 2 Chainz is five years older than Lil Wayne. Of course, in the mid-’90s Wayne willed his way into the Cash Money Records offices as a quasi-intern—and then onto radio and television—before he was old enough to drive; of course, the arc of 2 Chainz’s early career more closely resembles an EKG readout, to the point where the first song on 2007’s long-delayed Playaz Circle debut was a paean to missed release dates called “Dear Mr. L.A. Reid.” And still, this little piece of biographical data seems wrong.When 2 Chainz finally became a star, in the early 2010s, it was in a distinctly post-Tha Carter III world. Mixtapes were still idiosyncratic and unmonetizable, but rap was in its brief flirtation with EDM, and the collapse of the CD sales economy meant only established megastars or exaggerated personas like his could cut through the din. Even the way the two close friends have processed, in their solo work, their relationships to the past are incongruent, with Wayne perpetually shadowboxing the greats of prior generations while 2 Chainz tinkers with prestige objects self-consciously positioned as modern successors to The Blueprint.Unfortunately, Welcome 2 Collegrove, the second album to pair these two MCs, is profoundly unstuck in time, dotted with the vestiges of two bygone eras but imbued with few of those eras’ charms. The liner notes recall an entire era including SARS, Perez Hilton, and Iraq war protests through the Obama campaigns: DJ Toomp and STREETRUNNER, Bangladesh and Big K.R.I.T., Usher and Marsha Ambrosious. But the LP is frustratingly polished, defaulting to pristine mixes and beats that are crisp, thin, and wholly anonymous. (This extends, sadly, to those from the most beloved contributors: Mannie Fresh’s crowded, directionless “Big Diamonds” and Havoc’s pair of middling tracks, including a stale 36 Chambers riff.) Combined with verses that frequently prioritize competency over invention, these tracks make for an album that only intermittently gestures toward either rapper’s signature styles.On Da Drought 3 or T.R.U. REALigion—even on the highlights from 2016’s superior Collegrove—there was an air of delirious impulsivity, the sense that Wayne or 2 Chainz might, in the next moment, conjure a flow or an image that no human being had ever before conceived of. There was a looseness of structure that allowed for hooks or high stakes but required neither. Welcome 2 Collegrove drags each artist into the middle of the road where even some inspired premises (the mutation, on “Crazy Thick,” of Wayne’s infamous deposition video into a strip club instrumental, or his tight little seesaw cadence on “Long Story Short”) are sanded down to their least memorable versions. This is true on the utterly rote “Millions From Now” and the practically narcotized “Transparency,” the schmaltzy “Can’t Believe You” and “Godzilla,” a song as “lukewarm” as 2 Chainz describes a particular woman’s mouth.",Rap,5.8
550,"Self-released in 1978, this gorgeous set of ancient songs and instrumental abstractions predicted the shape of folk to come. Soon after she crossed into her sixties, and just six years before she died, in New Orleans, in 2003, Dorothy Carter became an unlikely star. Her life had been a whirlwind: Born in New York but raised in Boston, she was a childhood piano whiz who forsook professional life for a vagabond existence scattered among convents in Mexico, stints as a steamboat deckhand on the Mississippi, and communal living and music-making in Maine. But in the mid ’90s, while Carter was sleeping on floors in Berlin, what already sounds like a fable took a stranger-than-Chaucer twist. On a lark, she proposed an all-women ensemble playing the very old music of Europe in modern settings. The result, Mediæval Bæbes, was an unexpected sensation, their extravagant anachronism selling hundreds of thousands of records and becoming popular enough to become an easy potshot for rock critics. Still, no less an éminence grise than John Cale produced their third album, not long before Carter left a group that even now remains a winkingly witchy European novelty.However unlikely the Mediæval Bæbes seemed, they were, for Carter, a logical outgrowth of the music she’d pursued for decades. After trading the piano for the harp, she immersed herself in Renaissance madrigals, French chanson, and European ballads and hymns that had made the trip across the Atlantic. When Carter encountered the struck-and-plucked psaltery in New York in the ’70s, her cross-century song stockpile finally clicked: “I felt something like a strange recognition,” Carter later wrote of the moment. “THIS was the instrument I wanted to play.”Her enthusiasm for the psaltery and its zither kin, the dulcimer, would last a lifetime. The imaginative music she made with them has long been hidden away on 1978’s Waillee Waillee, a private-press gem coveted by crate diggers and Discogs hounds that has at long last been reissued, salvaged from nearly five decades of obscurity. It is the start of a loving and stepwise quest to get her prescient records—and her compelling story, in book form—into public view at last. A seamless hybrid of clarion folk arrangements and coruscant drones, Waillee Waillee functions as a signal flare for that effort, its strange permutations articulating the shapes that acoustic and new-age music would take together in the coming years. A beautiful, sad, and bemused record, Carter’s opus is a joy to behold, as alive and vital now as it was then.Atavistic songs, some of which predated her by almost a millennium, anchored Carter’s work. The Frenchman Adam de la Halle had been dead for nearly 700 years when Carter recorded her jubilant instrumental take of his love song “Robin M’aime,” her sparkling strings radiating off big, hollow drums like glitter beneath a full moon. Her “Celtic Medley” on the psaltery weaves together traditional Irish and Scottish ballads and waltzes, leaving notes hanging so that the overtones fade like morning dew.",Folk,8.5
551,"Before the Asheville guitarist found his signature blend of deadpan humor and tight hooks, he cut his teeth on the more introspective songwriting highlighted on his newly reissued 2019 solo debut. It’s been a banner year and a half for the unassuming MJ Lenderman. Thanks to both his solo work and his role in modern Southern rock group Wednesday, the Asheville guitarist has become a genuine indie-rock star. His recent output has included his 2022 breakthrough Boat Songs, last month’s stellar live collection And the Wind (Live and Loose!), and Wednesday’s anthemic Rat Saw God, which showcased the communal side to Lenderman’s guitar playing. Another solo album is on the way, but in the meantime, a new reissue of Lenderman’s self-titled 2019 debut—including its first-ever vinyl edition—offers a fresh look at his fuzz-rock origins.For anyone who discovered Lenderman through bite-sized vignettes like “Someone Get the Grill Out of the Rain,” the droniness of MJ Lenderman may come as a surprise. These songs sprawl to six or eight minutes in length, filled out with molasses-slow drums from Owen Stone and circuitous guitar melodies from Lenderman and Lewis Dahm. (The band also includes frequent Lenderman collaborators Colin Miller and Xandy Chelmis on bass and lap steel, respectively, along with guest appearances from Wednesday’s Karly Hartzman, Indigo De Souza, and saxophonist Alex Brown.) Yet the album doesn’t feel plodding or dense; as the song “Space” would suggest, Lenderman gives these tracks room to breathe, letting a single strum or burst of reverb play out for a moment before the band comes back together like a long exhale.On his earlier work, Lenderman took inspiration from Jason Molina, and anyone familiar with the Songs: Ohia/Magnolia Electric Co. oeuvre will recognize some of its hallmarks here. You can hear Molina’s bleating inflection in Lenderman’s singing on “Heartbreak Blues,” his voice scraping the rafters of his tenor register, or in the multiple references to “the darkness” that punctuate the album’s musings on loneliness. But underneath the gravitas, Lenderman’s plainspoken style offsets the heaviness with candid observations. “Southern Birds” sounds like it was inspired by nothing more than what Lenderman saw outside his window one morning, and that simplicity brings levity and warmth to the whole record.Lenderman shines an ample spotlight on his collaborators, which also helps cut through any self-seriousness. The album’s centerpiece is “Left Your Smile,” a gorgeous song built around a guitar hook reminiscent of Drive-By Truckers in which Lenderman’s voice is completely absent from the chorus, replaced by De Souza’s low, ghostly howl. On “Grief,” Lenderman distills the feeling into its most elemental form—“There’s a part of you/I wanna hold in my hands/A part of you I want again”—while letting Alex Brown’s mournful saxophone take center stage.",Rock,7.8
552,"Produced by Mo Troper, the full-length debut from Brenden Ramirez’s power pop project surges with quiet confidence and an open heart. Brenden Ramirez is a power pop quick study. After playing in all manner of rock bands growing up, Ramirez studied jazz guitar at Willamette University, a pursuit that took him as far as Nepal, where he briefly taught at the Kathmandu Jazz Conservatory. His music degree had a focus on improvisation: the antithesis of power pop, a style that seeks to replicate the anarchic impact of the ’64 Beatles under strict lab conditions. But there are times on Who’s a Good Boy, Ramirez’s debut full-length as Bory, when he slips into power pop suddenly yet naturally, like a childhood friend appearing in a dream.Some of that familiarity can be chalked up to Ramirez’s post-grad employment. Soon after moving to Portland in 2018, he joined the backing band of local power pop omnivore Mo Troper, who produced and played on Who’s a Good Boy. “I don’t think I even knew what power pop was until I met Mo,” Ramirez admitted to Willamette Week earlier this month, “which I think is a common occurrence for people who meet Mo.” That experience is evident from gems like the lead single “We Both Won,” a jangling post-breakup anthem that beams its arpeggiation like a forced smile. “North Douglas” is a plea to visit a partner’s childhood home, outfitted with dual guitars. The chorus peals like church bells, melodies and countermelodies folding into each other.Just like another Troper-produced power pop record released this year, Diners’ Domino (to which Ramirez contributed additional guitar), there’s a naturalism to the lyrics that contrasts with the almost formalist arrangements. But where Domino felt like an internal monologue, Who’s a Good Boy has a second-person intimacy. Some tracks seem to open in the middle of an argument: “Don’t take this the wrong way.” “I’m sorry for being weird.” But Ramirez’s breathy tenor defuses tension. “To find the words in my head/It takes a while,” he confesses on the opening track, the dream-pop apologia “The Flake.” The desire to connect is palpable. His guitar yowls in parallel motion with his refrain; the production is so saturated, it laps at the speakers.Despite the measured chime and judicious use of handclaps, this is at heart a prototypical PNW indie-pop effort. Warm but guarded, intricate and muted, reminiscent of the Shins and David Bazan and especially Elliott Smith. The blown-out instrumental break on “Five-Course Meal” is Smith through and through: the choirboy coos, peaking guitars and Mellotron wash could have appeared on anything after XO. There’s a jolt whenever you spot a familiar chord change, or recognize the melodic contour of a closing word. It feels less like homage and more like Bory’s vocabulary.",Rock,7.3
553,"Cameron Mesirow’s third album as Glasser is lightly fanciful yet deeply felt, using subtle flourishes to consider the meaning of death and what comes after. Cameron Mesirow—better known as art pop auteur Glasser—has always done it herself. Ring, her 2010 debut, was entirely made with Garageband. Its follow-up, 2013’s Interiors, traded colorful ridges for sleek contemporary avant-garde pop yet retained an independent spirit. A decade later, for her third studio album, Mesirow has pivoted to something more complex and idiosyncratic. If Interiors looked to the future and Ring faced the past, crux is nestled in a baroque, nearly-medieval period—a sort of in-between-ness of things, befitting for the album’s narrative of life after the death of a close friend. Falling back on her Celtic and Scottish roots, Mesirow crafts a lightly fanciful yet deeply felt elegy, using subtle flourishes to consider the meaning of death and what comes after.In the olden days, a poet typically called upon a muse in the first few lines of a poem. Here, Mesirow echoes this technique with the opening song, “A Guide.” It’s a kind of invocation that fits neatly within the Vangelis-chic of the Weeknd’s After Hours, with neon-lit synths simmering in the wet dark and digitally androgynous backing vocals. On “Design,” from her last record, Mesirow wondered if there was a God. On crux, she seems to have surrendered if not to a specific deity then at least to a higher power—hope for the afterlife, perhaps.Undergirding Mesirow’s spirituality is the physical desire that runs through all her work. “As far as I’m concerned, all my records are horny records,” Mesirow said in a recent interview with Vogue. Describing him simply as her “first love” in the same interview, Mesirow lets the music tell us all we need to know about her relationship with the man she lost to an accidental overdose. crux lovingly addresses that absence. “Knave” and “Thick Waltz” turn with nonverbal and primordial feeling, reaching for something folkloric but also instinctual with slide guitar and alto sax, respectively. On “Clipt,” Mesirow centers her Celtic ancestry, leaving room for a sprightly violin breakdown in the song’s second half. “Drift” balances a buoyant beat and strings with existential musings. “What a good life/except for all those times/when you want to die,” Mesirow sings.If you’ll forgive a few lapses into the maudlin, where her songwriting lacks the words for grief’s indeterminable emotions, crux becomes a vibrant and altogether moving record. It relinquishes old frameworks for a deeper, more complicated approach to music than anything in Mesirow’s discography. It doesn’t just fill an empty space, it takes the shape of the void.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

554,"The Bradford boys make a bid for commercial glory on their fourth album, but they’re better off staying unhinged than appealing to the mainstream. Bad Boy Chiller Crew wants to be known for more than their silliness. Never mind the videos of them slugging Smirnoff from the bottle and retching in an alley, or cackling in the passenger seat as they churn through prank calls. Ignore the allegations that one member went to the hospital with a kidney infection after a fan hurled an ounce of ketamine on stage at a show. There they are showing up to the BRIT Awards in a horse and carriage, sharing their tips to avoid a hangover (“Get straight back on it”) and vowing to chop one of the boy’s mullets if their album tops the charts. The trio from Northern England makes frenetic tracks that slam through your skull; the songs explode like a shaken Coke bottle. In the Bad Boy Chiller Crew cinematic universe, every bender leaks into the next—“From the nightclub to the kitchen!” as the boys howl in one of their better new tracks. They make lifelong friends in urinals. They get high, get into hijinks, and get home just in time to hit up an endless blur of clubs. It’s because, not in spite of, this central goofiness that the Bradford boys have found such a broad audience. “People automatically wanna be our friends because we make the world look like a fucking joke,” one of the boys told British GQ; it’s also a large part of why so many listen.Influential, the group’s latest release, is a bloated bridge between their frenzied bangers and a bid for the mainstream. “We’re going for commercial,” the boys have said in interviews, and with every release, they’ve gotten closer to that goal. Even though they strive to show off their range, the project feels more disparate and distracted than expansive. They wobble between blown-out bangers and a pitched-down Cher interpolation (“Believe”), treacly odes to girls they met at a club on a Tuesday (“Found True Love [You’re the Best Thing]”), wailing wonders about where their soul has gone. They demand to know if love is “true.” “Thought we could have set in stone,” they rap at one point. “Now you’re nothing but a stepping stone.” It’s clever-enough wordplay, but too flimsy to elicit any feeling, and too earnest to excuse as a bit.Of course, you don’t turn to the Bad Boy Chiller Crew to learn about love. The boys work best when they bludgeon a sample: They take a shimmery vocal and pound any melodrama out of it, thwacking bass drops, grunts, sirens, and bleats over lilting lines about love and fame. Influential lingers way too long on other voices: “Why Did You Play Me” spends 45 seconds with Kyla, of “One Dance” fame, before the Bad Boy Chiller Crew barrels in. “Say Goodbye” begins with a wispy female vocalist pledging eternal devotion for nearly a minute, until the B.B.C.C. steamrolls through, chanting about drinks on tap. They edge dangerously close to sounding like Cascada.Compared to the fricative pulses of a song like “Bounce to This One,” or the coked-out wallop of “Sliding,” the love songs here are chintzy sugar rushes. The less sense they make, the better they sound. Why are they frantically rapping about how badly they want to go into space? What’s with the squiggle of bagpipes in “Jurgen Kropper,” one of two throbbing tracks named after football players? They remix a 2007 rave anthem from DJ Q, a stalwart of the sped-up cousin of UK garage known as bassline, into a song that sounds like the “Cha Cha Slide” on poppers. Bad Boy Chiller Crew dazzles and delights in absurdity.That’s not to say they can’t also make you feel something. “Memory” is the most successful song here at smuggling in an actual emotion, likely because the boys sing it themselves. “I want to be there with you, but I can’t trust nobody,” they murmur, before the beat hiccups and accelerates. No matter how hard they try to make themselves palatable to the masses, they’re still most comfortable in chaos.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

555,"The Queens-raised rapper’s fourth album is an inconsistent letdown, swaying between soul-baring R&B, cookie-cutter flexes, and empty posturing. Bas is one of a few Dreamville delegates who has yet to experience a true breakout moment. The Paris-born, Queens-raised artist, who has also lived in Qatar and briefly went to college in Virginia, is the son of a Sudanese diplomat. That recipe should make for an interesting perspective; in practice, he combines a flexible New York-cool rap style with beats that blend trap, boom-bap, and dashes of Afrobeats and R&B. It has led him to decent success, with four studio albums and two RIAA-certified platinum releases to his name. But his highest-streamed song on Spotify, a 2018 J. Cole collaboration called “Tribe,” stands out more for his guest’s electrifying verse and producer Childish Major’s peppy, guitar-led beat than his own contributions. He’s certainly come a long way from near-death shoot-outs on Hillside Avenue and helping his brother—Cole’s manager and Dreamville co-founder Ibrahim Hamad—pass out mixtapes at the North Carolina rapper’s early release parties. Still, he has yet to cross over like fellow Dreamville signees JID and Ari Lennox have. Though he’s a competent rapper with a good ear for beats and a distinct background, he hasn’t quite cracked how to translate those unique traits into a full project.His fourth album, We Only Talk About Real Shit When We’re Fucked Up, attempts to split the difference, with more R&B melodies and heartfelt vulnerability than ever. The general idea—finding the courage to be open about your life and struggles while sober—is a ripe one, but Bas only occasionally transcends the hokey weedism of the album’s title. Startling revelations, like stories of friends stealing money from Dreamville artists and reflections on his life before fame, bring new depth to his writing: a heartbeat to back up the flashy flows and shit talk. But these thoughts are only explored in fits and starts; Bas often defaults to the boilerplate posturing and jet-setting flings of his earlier work. It’s a naked attempt to open up to fans on a more personal level, and the inconsistency makes it even harder to connect with.Opener “Light of My Soul” is at least a promising start. The first verse rides in on a mournful vocal sample, its melancholy accentuating his tales of strained friendships and drunken nights. By the time the drums thud into place, he’s completely baring his soul, delivering lines about wearing sunglasses to hide behind his pain and working through his people-pleasing tendencies: “Mama told me ‘Treat ’em to the light of my soul/The light of my soul, and don’t expect nothing back’/The light of my soul, but shit, I want something back.” Exasperation is uncommon on a Bas song, and hearing him navigate this emotion over such a forlorn beat is as uncomfortable as it is gripping.",Rap,6.3
556,"On his third solo album, the former Foxygen player indulges his mischievous instincts while mourning dead friends. As one half of Foxygen, Jonathan Rado rode shotgun with one of the most notoriously volatile indie acts of the early 2010s. His duo with Sam France balanced classic-rock worship and home-recording hijinks with Behind the Music and onstage meltdowns, but out of that dysfunction came another, less sensationalistic narrative: the emergence of Rado as the go-to producer for fellow retro-minded mavericks like the Lemon Twigs and Father John Misty. With Foxygen inactive since 2019’s Seeing Other People, Rado has been free to adapt his old-school aesthetic to the modern pop marketplace, giving him a foothold in the liners of buzzworthy records by the likes of Weyes Blood and Crumb. And through his associations with Aussie eccentric Alex Cameron—aka Brandon Flowers’ bestie—he wound up co-producing and co-writing the most recent albums by the Killers, a gig that completed his transformation into something akin to a West Coast-reared Jack Antonoff.But if his career trajectory suggests a desire to trade the hand-to-mouth drudgery of band life for a more stable seat behind the mixing desk, Rado isn’t farming out all of his good ideas to his high-profile clients. For Who the Bell Tolls For is technically Rado’s third solo release, following a pair of low-stakes records that reconfirmed what we already knew about him—he’s a fan of lo-fi lunacy (2013’s glorified demo collection Law and Order) and a student of classic-rock mythology (a faithful 2017 Born to Run). But For Who the Bell Tolls For feels like a proper coming-out party for Rado the artist/auteur, an opportunity to flex his elevated production chops on a set of songs that embody his cavalier boho spirit while striking a more personal chord. For Who the Bell Tolls For was written in response to the deaths of two dear friends: musician/producer (and early Foxygen champion) Richard Swift and actor/visual artist Danny Lacy. But the album is less an act of mourning than a celebration of life, befitting its simultaneously serious and tongue-in-cheek title. For Who the Bell Tolls For is equally profound and playful, a work of art-pop grandeur that’s grounded by its self-effacing, homespun charm.As a producer, Rado is quick to cite the influence of Brian Eno’s Oblique Strategies on his process, but as a songwriter he remains very much in thrall to a familiar Foxygen influence: Todd Rundgren. And so on the album’s momentous title track, he rolls the sumptuous songcraft of Something/Anything? into the theatrical irreverence of Here Comes the Warm Jets, creating a runaway snowball of a song that—thanks to guests like Brad Oberhofer and the Lemon Twigs’ D’Addario brothers—accumulates layers of brass, choral harmonies, and crashing percussion until it’s big enough to flatten cities. On top of serving as a business card for a producer who can nurture a simple repeated melody into a skyscraping epic, the song also establishes the album’s defiant, life-goes-on tenor, and its refusal to be overcome with grief.",Rock,7.5
557,"On their third album, the Mexican dream-pop duo leans further into their soothing and immersive sound, taking a soft dive into the comfort of solitude. During the height of the pandemic, Mint Field returned home to Mexico City to record Aprender a Ser in isolation, then spent the last three years refining its sound. The mood is wistful, but never dreary. They sketch out hazy scenes, like clouds settling over a vast landscape without a stormy ending or a slinky noir film. While their previous work relied more on contrasting airy vocals with gritty guitar outbursts, Aprender a Ser leans into sleek trip-hop, with vaporous synths and Sebastian Neyra’s heavy basslines. It’s dream pop without a script.Mint Field build a collection of shadowy tracks that blend seamlessly into each other. On “El Suspiro Cambia Todo,” radiating synths and licking reverb set a consistent atmospheric tone for the rest of the album. The group excels at fostering a specific airy reverie, and they don’t verge often from this chilled-out stupor. But on standout “Moronas,” a drum machine punches up the pace and locks in a track perfect for a vintage intergalactic video game. Mint Field pull from a popular set of ’90s influences—Portishead, Low, Mazzy Star—but they never feel too referential. The group weaves strands of its inspirations together to create their own avant-pop sound.Frontwoman Estrella del Sol Sánchez’s hypnotic voice is at the core of the group. There’s a numbness in her drawn-out breaths. She never fully gives into her deepest emotions, so we’re left with our ear against the door, making sense of the muffled voices behind it. She was inspired by the Cocteau Twins’ Elizabeth Fraser, whose vocals served more as a layer inside a song’s arrangement. And like Fraser, Sánchez is always on the verge of floating away. On “Sueño Despierto,” Sánchez’s delicate falsetto melds with a swirl of fluttering saxophones, pulling us further into her impending dream state. It’s a harmonious example of how her voice fuses with lush instrumentals–the aural equivalent of watching dollops of paint mix on a canvas.Sánchez is a spare songwriter, relying more on the timbre of her voice to convey the songs’ emotions than lyrical complexity. Her words often repeat, soft and yearning, evoking natural ephemeral images—the leaves of an orchid wilting or a butterfly’s brief lifespan. For Sánchez, nature is a reminder of her impermanence. There aren’t huge revelations to take away from these tracks. Sánchez only grazes the surface of her inner world without much personal specificity. And the album can dwindle as its weightless charm wears off. But Mint Field are more about conjuring a feeling than spelling out a narrative. Aprender a Ser is a dream world without much explanation, but like the body settling into a chilled pool, the acclimation is worth it.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

558,"The debut from the downtempo trip-hop duo is how it’s done. Its nuanced production and smoky mood deliver a completely stylish result. Given the tossed-off origins of the term “trip-hop”—“hip-hop in a flotation tank,” Mixmag’s Andy Pemberton called it in the 1994 article where he coined the term; “mood muzak for the blunted ’n’ paranoid,” Melody Maker’s Simon Reynolds offered a few months later—the animating idea has proven remarkably resilient. Take a boom-bap beat, paint on a dusky bassline or pitched-down sample, drape it all in echo, turn down the dimmer switch. Usually—not always, but much of the time—there’ll be a singer involved, typically a woman. Sometimes it’s a voice that sounds like lust incarnate; sometimes like your own thoughts tossing beneath a weighted blanket of the heaviest doubt.In the past three decades, trip-hop has soundtracked innumerable make-out sessions, melted into the wallpaper of countless fast-fashion dressing rooms, produced some indisputable classics, even minted a superstar or two. The fact that it’s never really gone away also means that it’s never had a proper revival. But there have been stirrings of late, as ’90s electronic styles like trance and drum’n’bass have re-entered the lexicon. The debut album from a.s.o. feels like trip-hop’s purest expression in years.The duo’s members—singer Alia Seror-O’Neill, aka Alias Error, and producer Lewie Day, aka Tornado Wallace, both Australians based in Berlin—initially connected over a mutual love of Kylie Minogue and Madonna, yet their music skews much darker than those influences. It’s darker even than, say, Avalon Emerson’s debut album or CFCF’s Memoryland, two recent forays into electronic pop inspired by a similar assemblage of ’90s touchstones. As Tornado Wallace, Day is typically known for a tropical, laid-back sound; in a.s.o., he’s kept the tempos slow but burned off all the Balearic influence, leaving just skeletal drums wreathed in smoke. Spy-movie guitars add noir shading; Middle Eastern scales snake around the edges; acid synths take tentative swipes in the shadows.In keeping with its influences—Portishead’s Dummy, Massive Attack’s Protection, Tricky’s Maxinquaye—the mood is sullen and brooding. In “My Baby’s Got It Out for Me,” the bassline scuffs against the root note while flashes of dub siren and doppler-effected synths suggest teeming city streets. But a.s.o. aren’t averse to the occasional glint of brightness. The keys of the opening “Go On” are supple and satiny, swollen with tone, and despite the downcast vibe, the occasional major-key harmony occasionally reveals itself like a half-hidden grin.Day’s uncommonly subtle productions elevate a.s.o.’s music over most other trip-hop revivalists, but Seror-O’Neill is the group’s true life force. She’s not a showy singer; she often favors a soft, breathy tone, and she sees no need to sing three notes when two will do. But she’s sneakily versatile. She can do dreamy, desiring, and wounded; she’s got the ease of Martina Topley-Bird, the sweetness of Elizabeth Fraser, and the airiness of Julee Cruise. Occasionally, she even offers a hint of Lana Del Rey’s sullen poise. In “Rain Down,” she sticks to the midrange, infusing a taut melodic line with bitterness before leaping up a register and drifting blissfully over a curiously curlicued chorus.",Pop,7.8
559,"The Indiana band supplies a sunny Midwestern take on nostalgic, shoegazey dream-pop. Wishy is the millionth band manifesting nostalgic misrememberings of the dreamier side of ’90s indie rock. Singer-songwriters and guitarists Nina Pitchkites and Kevin Krauter went to the same Indiana high school but reconnected later, when Pitchkites moved back to Indianapolis, bonding over the Sundays and My Bloody Valentine. After releasing a self-titled EP as Mana earlier this year, the band—rounded out by drummer Connor Host, bassist Mitch Collins, and third guitarist and vocalist Dimitri Morris—changed its name to Wishy, signed to Winspear, and gained a sunkissed sheen thanks to L.A. producer Ben Lumsdaine.The Paradise EP is Wishy’s proper introduction, and the words one might use to describe it—“My Bloody Valentine Unplugged” or “The Cardigans getting more into The La’s”—may seem like simple, hyperbolic praise for music you’ve heard before. Still, Paradise captures a uniquely Midwest approach to shoegaze, in which one’s vision is directed not down toward one’s shoes but up and out, at quiet skies and isolated fields surrounding small towns and cities where you might go hours without seeing someone outside their car. Wishy don’t need to hide away their feelings under noise: Though Pitchkites and Krauter split songwriting duties, both emphasize the kind of dreamy topline melodies that invite you to hum along. One of Paradise’s best moments comes on the opening title track, when Krauter and Pitchkites switch off lead vocals while the other joins in near-perfect harmony. As the song builds up, Krauter’s guitar riffs kick in and become Wishy’s newest and most gleeful singer, like a child running free of its parents.The rest of the EP showcases what makes each songwriter distinct. Pitchkites wrote “Donut,” a sledgehammer of sound in which her riffs and vocals match the pent-up frustration of the lyrics. She sees all the possibilities of the open road, but her crappy car can only get her nowhere in spurts. When she moans the final chorus lyric, “I’m speeding down HOV and huffing on gasoline,” the guitars and drums are too busy dancing around her wrecked daydream to notice. “Spinning” takes a slower, mellower route to getting lost, sounding a little like The Radio Dept. with a dancey drumbeat seemingly lifted from Krauter’s old band, Hoops.If Pitchkites is the songwriter more likely to dive in and do snow angels in the dirt, Krauter is too busy watching the sunrises that add shades of pink and blue to the morning sky. In “Blank Time,” every few seconds bring some intricate new instrumentation or melody into the mix. It’s a busy song that shows off Krauter’s guitar playing and sounds like one of his solo songs—specifically “Patience,” from 2020, leaving the impression that Wishy could have instead written something fresher to take advantage of Pitchkites’ harmonies. “Too True” is more successful: The full band feels in sync as Krauter laments a past relationship and what gets lost when we move on for the right reasons. Or something like that—on a great gazepop track, lyrical meaning is secondary.",Rock,7.3
560,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit the stunning 1981 debut from the English post-punk band, an archly subversive album with style just as sharp as its politics. The Au Pairs had been warned. And it would have been so easy not to do it. It would have been so easy to stay silent, passive, and do as they were told. But let’s be real. A political punk band isn’t going to stop being political for the sake of some airtime on the BBC’s The Old Grey Whistle Test. That would be so very boring. That would be so very stupid. Because, if you have a platform, saying fuck you to Margaret Thatcher and saying fuck you to Northern Ireland for torturing female political prisoners on live television was exactly what you should do.Thus: the Au Pairs got up there and performed their song “Armagh,” even though they were told they really shouldn’t. There was the heaving snarl of Jane Munro’s bass, the strident slant of Pete Hammond’s drums, and the dueling guitars and vocals of Paul Foad and Lesley Woods. “We don’t torture,” Woods sang, “We’re a civilized nation!” Anything can happen on live television. The Au Pairs knew that. They were never asked back.They weren’t interested in making things easy. They didn’t often write lyrics that you could get your head around quickly, nor did they construct songs focused on delivering a dopamine hit on first blush, even if that was, perhaps, the ultimate intent. And in their politics, they weren’t interested in any sort of armchair socialism, theoretically dense, pseudo-Marxist whatever bullshit. “We’re not an army on a mission, we do commercial songs,” Pete once said, tongue-in-cheek, to NME in 1980. Chiming in, Woods said: “We’d like to be number one.”Here is what they did instead: write music that, while not exactly militant, was explicitly political. There is no way to listen to “Armagh” and not taste how much the band detested Margaret Thatcher and her curdled, inherently cynical realpolitik. There is no alternative, Thatcher famously said about capitalism being the only system that works. Wait, seriously? the Au Pairs seemed to say in response. They were cynical about the idea that following the ’60s, everyone was supposed to be so liberated—how could that possibly explain Thatcher? It was not as if we had finally figured out everything about sex. The Au Pairs were blunt about all of this in a way that made people uncomfortable. “All I do in writing lyrics,” said Woods, “is try and provide a new understanding of situations that people take for granted or accept as natural or normal.” This is what made their debut album, Playing With a Different Sex, a revelation.",Rock,9.3
561,"The new reissue of a landmark album of 1970s funk restores the Los Angeles group’s reputation as multi-cultural pop savants and unstoppable improvisers. It was a simple idea: Combine the everyday music of Long Beach and nearby Compton with the ascendant sounds of funk, soul, and R&B, and shape it all into something that would sound right coming out of a radio anywhere in the United States. By the time they released The World Is a Ghetto in 1972, War had the levels dialed in perfectly.The Long Beach party band had spent 1969 banging around Los Angeles County playing heavy R&B as the backing band for future NFL Hall of Famer Deacon Jones when producer Jerry Goldstein caught their live show. He thought they’d be a perfect match for English singer Eric Burdon, who was just beginning his solo career following the dissolution of the Animals. The interracial band—Burdon and harmonica player Lee Oskar were white, the rest of the band was Black—had a hit by mid-1970 with “Spill the Wine,” a talky pastoral funk song that set Burdon’s Kinks-indebted lyrics against a snapping rhythm. The singer would leave the group following 1970’s regrettably titled The Black Man’s Burdon, but the spirit of multicultural brotherhood—and the freedom from genre expectations it would provide—remained. Working closely with Goldstein, War became both a heavyweight live band and a sophisticated pop machine, slicker than Sly and the Family Stone and more down to earth than Funkadelic.Five decades later, War are primarily remembered for 1975’s “Low Rider,” an all-time great song that’s been licensed so frequently and decontextualized so thoroughly it now feels like something of a novelty. Rhino’s new reissue of The World Is a Ghetto—the best-selling album of 1973, with a single that shipped a million copies—not only restores War’s reputation as some of the savviest and most omnivorous pop composers of the 1970s; its bonus disc of in-studio jams suggests they might have rivaled Herbie Hancock’s Headhunters as one of funk’s greatest groups of improvisers.The World Is a Ghetto was originally intended to be a stage play that War percussionist Papa Dee Allen was developing about a character named Ghetto Man. One night, while the band was jamming in their Long Beach warehouse, he hit upon a revelation, as co-founder and keyboardist Lonnie Jordan recalls in the reissue’s liner notes. They’d been playing around in Malibu and Santa Monica, and had seen firsthand that wealth and privilege didn’t necessarily guarantee a great life. In their view, Ghetto Man wasn’t any different from the guy with the beachfront property who still struggled with addiction. And that changed how they saw the world: “The world is a ghetto.”",Rock,8.8
562,"The Calgary dancer and singer’s second album strikes a tough pose but offers mostly forgettable trap-pop ballads. When Tate McRae punctuated her debut with blunt ruminations on teenage love and coming of age, the dance competitor turned pop singer was heralded as Canada’s answer to Billie Eilish. For her second album, THINK LATER, McRae toughens up that first impression by becoming a Canadian Sporty Spice, trading neon sweatshirts for hockey gear. It’s a classic formula: Good girl goes man-eating badass, and she’s ready to make that jerk regret losing her. Too bad she’s still hung up on him—and THINK LATER is full of homogeneous trap-pop ballads devoted to one-dimensional introspection.To showcase a “feistier” version of herself, McRae assembled a roster of prominent pop writers and producers, including OneRepublic’s Ryan Tedder, SZA’s SOS collaborator Rob Bisel, and Ariana Grande associate ILYA. They land on a style that’s undeniably indebted to Bangerz and the 2010s obsession with trap-pop, updated to iterate on SZA’s love-hate yearning and the Weeknd’s atmospheric alt-R&B. On “run for the hills,” McRae explores the lure of an unhealthy relationship under a looming cloud of synth that’s pierced by single words in her head voice, like Grande rapping “gimme the loot!” on “7 rings.”Most of the album is similarly concerned with presenting McRae as the give-no-fucks bad girl. “It’s not a good night if you don’t take it too far,” she winks on the arena-stomping title track (which sounds a little like M.I.A.’s “Bad Girls” itself). The Timbaland-inspired “greedy,” one of the first and best songs on the record, is McRae at her most empowered and exciting. At other times, the pettiness is just tiring. “we’re not alike” is a pop punk-lite temper tantrum about a friend who breaks girl code; it’s as if McRae attempted to emulate Eilish’s “Copycat” without the bite.Throughout THINK LATER, McRae’s narrator yearns for the kind of toxic romance that makes Harley Quinn and the Joker look restrained. “You’re the only one who can boil my blood/And make that shit cut,” she warbles on the clunky, mid-tempo “messier,” which sounds like a good reason to finally dump him. Then she goes starry-eyed: “’Cause you know that I’m always yours/I’m so in love.” Where SZA might plot a murder, McRae threatens to make a scene at dinner. The cycle is vicious but worse, it’s dull. Has Tate McRae ever considered protecting her peace?There’s another school of thought that likens McRae to Britney Spears, recognizing a dancer’s magnetism and competitive edge. McRae’s inability to produce equally compelling music leaves her in a bind. The more comparisons she earns, the more THINK LATER feels anonymous: stuck romanticizing the negative in an attempt to prove her seriousness as a singer. Her music is strongest when she tosses the ballads in the bin. When she rode into the impeccably choreographed “greedy” video on a Zamboni, she looked like a budding star, and when she sings about a random guy who asks if she’s aware of her powers, her response is perfectly dry: “I said, ‘Lemme check.’” Sucks that the rest of THINK LATER can’t muster the same easy confidence.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

563,"A new reissue of the Stockholm multi-instrumentalist’s 2020 album highlights his knack for making a studio sound like a lightly psychedelic, breezy early-evening DJ set. It seems fitting that some listeners will first encounter Fastingen-92 as a reissue, even if only three years after its original release. Each track on this album from Stockholm multi-instrumentalist and studio wiz Daniel Ögren has the air of a record collector’s prized find, rescued from obscurity and turned into a cult favorite. After a limited-run release in 2020, it received a wider audience this year via the long-running UK label Mr Bongo, whose catalog is filled with reissues of the sort of crate-digger classics of global dance music that Ögren’s work clearly channels.Though Ögren played, recorded, and mixed nearly everything on these primarily instrumental pieces himself, together they feel like a breezy early-evening DJ set, traversing styles, eras, and continents from one selection to the next: a dembow rhythm that could have been lifted from a dancehall record, a live drummer expertly emulating the sampled breakbeats of ‘90s rap, percussion loops that hiss and wheeze like the early drum machines Sly Stone used to use. Atop these funky rhythms, Ögren arranges all manner of guitars, synths, and keyboards, most of them sweetened with vintage-sounding echo effects—psychedelic, but in the sense of a microdose to go along with your orange wine or mezcal negroni: a gentle heightening of buzzy sensation, not a disorienting head trip. The grooves are too buoyant, the melodies too insistent, for anyone to stray too far into the portals of their mind. You could dance to it, but it’s probably best suited for the moments just before full-on revelry breaks out, when people start to wiggle on their bar stools as they lean forward to order the next round.Though Ögren’s apparent influences are far-flung, the music on Fastingen-92 is also rooted in his particular Stockholm milieu. The way he combines dreamy psych-pop textures with hip-hop-inflected drums, and emphasizes midrangey analog warmth rather than the booming lows and tactile highs of digital-era pop, suggests an affinity for Dungen. (By extension, that means Fastingen-92 sometimes also recalls the heavily Dungen-indebted early records of Tame Impala.) And like his sometime collaborator Sven Wunder, Ögren seems to have a fondness for library music: records created in the mid-20th century for the express purpose of licensing to movies, advertisements, and the like, whose composers-for-hire were often more adventurous in soundtracking these scenes not-yet-imagined than the job strictly required.The best tracks on Festingen -92 occupy a similarly rich middle ground between specific detail and evocative elision, giving you just enough to invent your own settings for them. “Picasso,” with its romantic acoustic guitar melody and clattering percussion, suggests tropical humidity and ferns parting to reveal a tableau you can’t quite glimpse in full. “Maj (For Tintin)” has the relentless pulse of a rave anthem, but without any low-end heft; its vaporous sonics give the feeling of a bustling nightlife scene viewed from the clouds far above it. Though Ögren takes elements from existing styles, the sonic locales he dreams up are only loosely rooted in real-world geography: the main thing is that they’re very far away from wherever you are right now.",Rock,7.3
564,"The English producer’s full-length debut is full of cresting arpeggios and massive supersaws. It’s an ambitious ode to the ecstasy of trance music. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, between dreamy cloud rap, the prog aspirations of Brainfeeder, and the commercial convergence of trap-EDM, the lines between hip-hop production and electronic experimentation were blurred like never before. Perhaps the most zeitgeisty example of that confluence was Kanye West’s Yeezus, which brought leftfield producers like Arca, Hudson Mohawke, and Evian Christ into the mainstream. Yeezus wasn’t startling only because of its abrasiveness; it was just so unexpected to hear the biggest rapper in the world entrusting his sound to a new generation of electronic beatmakers. Christ was a relative unknown before his contribution to album cut “I’m in It,” but even though that credit pushed him into the spotlight, the artist born Joshua Leary largely avoided a career as a more traditional producer-for-hire. Instead, he threw himself into the rave, honing his craft as a DJ by way of his long-running Trance Party club night.Leary’s formal debut album, released a decade after that Kanye co-sign, still features the atmospheric layers that made his beats so bewitching back then. But you won’t find any trap hi-hats here; Revanchist is a ghostly love letter to the pure melodrama and overstimulating sensation of trance music. Opener “On Embers” hits you directly in the chest with massive supersaws, but Christ is just as captivated by moments of silence; indistinct gospel-house vocals hum, resembling shadowy figures silhouetted by smoke machines. “Yxguden” slowly builds with a cresting wave of synth arpeggios, before Bladee’s angelic falsetto and a thumping beat drop in tandem. “Free-free-free falling” are the first intelligible words on the album, evoking the unrestrained release that Christ nudges us toward.Christ’s palette recalls the glittering stadium schmaltz of Y2K-era trance producers like ATB and Paul Van Dyk, but he amplifies the exhilaration by drawing everything out, letting the euphoric textures simmer. Like Burial did for hardcore breaks and junglism, Leary deconstructs familiar genre tropes and reverse engineers them into alien signals, extracting nuanced emotions from underneath the flashy exterior of pop music. Though tracks like “Yxguden” indulge in the outright ecstasy of vocal trance, Revanchist often denies us immediate catharsis to instead linger in the haze.Thanks to his focus on live experience versus recorded music over the last few years, Christ’s work has grown slower and contemplative, more conducive to late-night comedowns than warming up the crowd. He approaches trance music less like a DJ weaving discrete tracks together, and more like the composer of a video game soundtrack conceptualizing sound as a spatial environment—Leary cites the iconic PlayStation 1 racing game WipeOut, which featured big beat tracks from the likes of Orbital and the Chemical Brothers, as a vital gateway to his love of dance music. The mammoth trap beats of 2014’s Waterfall were straightforward in their construction, where Revanchist is ambitious and structurally complex, trusting the listener enough to follow sounds that evolve in unexpected directions. “The Beach” is an endless swell with no way out, teasing a drop that never quite comes, as a distorted feminine voice bleeds into a rising tide of looping synth arpeggios and bass tones. The voices that Christ weaves in on tracks like “Silence” are lilting and warm, but strange too, mutated into misty choral chants; over the celestial piano of “With Me,” Swedish vocalist Merely stretches out her words, just like Leary’s synths reverberate with streaks of echo.",Electronic,7.5
565,"The Brooklyn rapper’s vivid storytelling and golden flow have inspired emcees for nearly 30 years. But his new album pales in the shadow of 2021’s momentous Doe or Die II. “No one can define you,” AZ says solemnly in the introduction to Truth Be Told, his 10th studio album, over a scant drum track and angelic vocals that throb like a heartbeat. “The moment you allow them to define you, you allow them to become your God.” It’s a fitting proclamation for the Brooklyn rapper who, after spitting an iconic guest verse at the start of Nas’ 1994 single “Life’s a Bitch,” has spent the last three decades reaffirming why he was offered the spot in the first place. His distinct nasal tone, vivid storytelling, and golden flow have inspired rappers from Joey Bada$$ and Rome Streetz to Rae Sremmurd’s Slim Jxmmi; not to mention he’s one of a handful of former major-label stalwarts who successfully went independent years before Roc Marciano and Griselda popularized the approach. Doe or Die II—the 2021 sequel to his 1995 solo debut—doubled as both a victory lap after its 12-year gestation period and a solid meat-and-potatoes rap album from an emcee who, at the time, was pushing 50. Now approaching 52, AZ still brings that cognac-in-an-easy-chair reminiscence to Truth Be Told, only this time, the ice has slightly melted and the stories are beginning to run together.Doe or Die II was thrilling as a showcase of AZ’s impressive skill and perspective. The down-on-his-luck capo from the original had not only come up from squalor but outlived his demons, and the way that story dovetailed with AZ’s own journey through rap helped the celebratory air feel earned. But while Truth Be Told has some exciting moments, there’s less meaningful reflection than its title implies and more spinning of the wheels. These are either stories we’ve heard before or ideas he’s executed with more flair elsewhere. That isn’t to say AZ has fallen off entirely. At its best, that Brooklyn slur of his is still gripping, riding through the contours of beats like a bucket with 150,000 miles on it. “Still Got It” and “The GOAT” are the sharpest examples: AZ fully locks in with the drums to talk about coming up from nights on the park bench and finding his place in rap history between Big Daddy Kane and Lil Wayne. But more often than usual, his flow gets a little slippery, derailing the momentum of some songs. And when that is combined with weaker storytelling and retreaded subject matter, like the bland paeans to Black capitalism on “Don’t Go Astray” or the career SparkNotes that is “One of the Greatest,” the illusion is broken.",Rap,6.4
566,"Forty years after the pastoral new age of From Gardens Where We Feel Secure, the UK composer once again fuses chamber folk with rural field recordings, conjuring a vivid sense of place. Nothing excites Virginia Astley more than the familiar comforts of home. Not the late-’70s underground circuit where she got her start, playing gigs at seedy pubs as a member of the new-wave outfit Victims of Pleasure. Not the subsequent post-punk wave either, when she had the opportunity to record with titans like Echo and the Bunnymen and Siouxsie and the Banshees. While on tour with the Teardrop Explodes in 1981, she played in a group called the Ravishing Beauties, contrasting the psychedelic assault of the headlining band with opulent melodic sweeps and her uniquely ghostly vocals. The Beauties never released a record (though they did record in John Peel’s BBC studios), but the music they made together laid the groundwork for the delicate soundscapes Astley would continue to explore in her solo career. Her debut album, 1983’s From Gardens Where We Feel Secure, came two years after the tour wrapped up, with a title that makes her preference for solitude abundantly clear.Gardens was a work of pastoral theater that infused sprightly woodwinds and strings with recordings from the riverside village of Moulsford-on-Thames, looping bleating livestock and rushing streams into miniature dioramas of rustic life. It would remain the only record of its kind in Astley’s catalog for four decades as she explored new modes, incorporating song and poetry into her worlds. With her new album The Singing Places, she returns with another assemblage of field recordings and elegant acoustic arrangements. She’s finally revisiting the verdant garden of her imagination.Astley collected sounds for The Singing Places in various locations around the upper bounds of the River Thames, which becomes more rural and sparsely populated the further it stretches away from the bustle of big cities. She said in a recent interview that she’s often struck by inspiration while on walks in the countryside; walking along the Thames is like turning the clock back to eons past. Centuries-old church bells ring out; rickety watermills creak as they revolve; Astley’s footsteps can occasionally be heard trodding well-worn pathways. There’s a sense that she’s enraptured by the history surrounding her as she passes through sites untouched by industrialization and weathered by the passage of time.To accompany these recordings, Astley weaves languorous musical motifs that drift alongside them. In contrast to the more structured vignettes on From Gardens Where We Feel Secure, The Singing Places is free and fluid, letting the gentle serenade of nature ring without interruption. Woodwinds join a choir of bird calls, then fall away against their sustained chirping. Strings swell into a lovely waltz, but never overwhelm the rippling of the river. It’s structured as one continuous, 27-minute piece, with each movement effortlessly flowing into the next, via some deft editing. It sounds like she is simply strolling from one idyllic scene to the next.",Experimental,7.6
567,"At once familiar and disorienting, the Australian-born, Berlin-based artist’s new album challenges any fixed ideas of what “guitar music” can be. Jules Reidy’s music feels like a private language. Its carefully voiced chords and patiently arranged forms imply an underlying structure, a kind of musical grammar. Its fingerpicking suggests a common lineage with the American primitive guitar tradition of John Fahey, as if both were branches of the same tree. Yet something about Reidy’s music remains untranslatable. Its richly unconventional tunings, according to the system known as just intonation, slip the bounds of ordinary 12-tone intervals. Its nagging repetition thwarts standard melodic forms. And the Australian-born, Berlin-based artist’s Auto-Tuned vocals, submerged low in the mix, are all but indecipherable. Their work is too rigorously structured to be called “abstract”; even at its most cryptic, it’s clearly expressing something. But what? You grasp for names that might fit Reidy’s elusive emotional register, searching in vain for an affective Rosetta Stone. The music feels both warmly familiar and uncomfortably alien; therein lies its power.Over time, their music has steadily expanded, growing outward from a busy amalgam of strumming and picking. It took on new textures, elements, and forms, challenging what “guitar music” could be. Auto-Tune came to the fore; their playing sprawled across side-long suites. On last year’s World in World, they explored shorter, more sketch-like pieces that placed the focus back on their guitar playing. But on their new album Trances, they reverse course, distilling all their ideas into their most potent composition yet. As a single piece of music divided into two parts on vinyl and Bandcamp (despite the 12 track markers noted on Spotify and Apple Music), there is only a single break in the music, halfway through the album’s 44-minute run. It is immersive and overwhelming, a bewitching synthesis of folk and ambient drone that is both beautiful and unsettling.Trances opens with a tentative strum—four notes in quick succession, bristling like the hairs on a dog’s back—wreathed in a broad, shimmering haze. New chords periodically blossom across the stereo field, branching outward like frost crystals filmed in stop motion. Their harmonies are not dissonant, exactly; “dissonance” implies an unwanted clash of sounds, whereas these are sleek and glassy and weirdly pleasing to the ear. But they are unusual in the extreme, and in that peculiarity opens up a vast expanse of possibility. Just as the theory of dark matter posits a hitherto unknown something lurking in plain sight, Reidy’s nitid tone clusters indicate hidden dimensions layered in between everyday, shopworn harmonies. Rushing white noise, like the roar of surf, occasionally surges underneath, suggesting a fantastical landscape bathed in palladous light.",Experimental,7.8
568,"The jazz-folk group blends acoustic guitar and percussion with dub echo and washes of synth on a mellow, intricate EP inspired by the natural world and its Bristol, England hometown. Bristol’s Tara Clerkin Band once had eight members, until five of them “un-joined,” leaving the eponymous Clerkin and brothers Sunny-Joe Paradiso and Patrick Benjamin as the Tara Clerkin Trio. Listening to the trio’s instrumental puzzles, it’s hard to imagine where you’d wedge five more pieces: This is slow, airy music that nonetheless teems with life, the jazz-folk equivalent of a Kelly Reichardt movie. Their new EP, On the Turning Ground, ambles through blissful psych-pop and washed-out breakbeats, harpsichord interludes and dubby balladry. Every new idea seems like a natural progression, as if you’d slowly wandered deeper into a verdant reserve.Tara Clerkin Trio’s self-titled 2020 debut was chic, nonchalant city music: The sinister gem “I Know He Will” felt like a live recording captured in a jazz club that shared a thin wall with a takeaway kitchen. Throughout the record, disparate sounds garbled and interweaved, capturing a sense of higgledy-piggledy beauty. On the Turning Ground is clearly still inspired by Bristol—the opening song is called “Brigstow,” an earlier form of the city’s name, and “The Turning Ground” is animated by the kind of breakbeat usually found in its famed d’n’b clubs—but it’s more wide-ranging, too, using synthetic sounds to mimic the slowness and stillness of the natural world. Paradiso’s snare brushes on “Brigstow” sound like leaves crunching underfoot; stabs of cello and melodica are like distant bird calls. On “World in Delay,” crackling dub production becomes a mirror of Clerkin’s lyrics, which look to botanic renewal as a sign of hope: “Only flowers on the tree/A remedy/Waiting for the new copy/Does it feel nearly real?”Clerkin’s words tend toward abstraction, but certain motifs recur. On “The Turning Ground,” she again seems to find solace in the passing seasons (“In another time/I’m new again”); on “Marble Walls” she sings of finding comfort in the echoing sounds of a church choir. Clerkin has a sweet, hard-to-pin-down voice: She’s prone to slowly, steadily drawing out syllables, like a less urbane Anna Domino, and sometimes sings with a Trish Keenan-esque sing-song quality.Mostly, Clerkin’s voice is an essential textural element; despite its chilly production, On The Turning Ground feels profoundly hopeful, and Clerkin’s high, resonant voice, when it pops up, feels like spring blooms cropping up between patches of frost. But even in its sparsest moments, On the Turning Ground seems to nod to a universe that’s constantly growing and expanding, even when things might feel static. On closer “Once Around,” a loop of Clerkin’s guitar is slowly surrounded by more and more echo, with such subtlety that at first you might not even notice it. Eventually, washes of synth spread underneath, and cello and harpsichord eventually subsume the guitar entirely. It’s the most melancholy song on the EP, and the most beautiful—incremental change and renewal, happening before your very ears.",Jazz,7.3
569,"The minimal-techno icon celebrates the 20th anniversary of the breakthrough LP where he first established his otherworldly percussive sensibility. There is a kind of party that has the rareness and mystique of a beautiful and endangered species, something connoisseurs spend years chasing and feel blessed to experience for themselves. Specifics will vary from person to person, but in many cases this scene may not much resemble what the average person might imagine when they hear the words “nightclub,” “rave” or “dancefloor.” Ricardo Villalobos described his version in a 2007 interview. It would be outside, preferably near a river. It would have exceptionally clear sound. And it would, in ways that are hard to explain, exist outside pressures of the world at large, free from the tyranny of linear time itself, a place where attendees—not so much paying customers eager to be entertained as warm-hearted people down for whatever—return to a state of childlike playfulness. Alcachofa, released on Playhouse in 2003 and reissued this year on Perlon, is both a soundtrack to, and transmission from, the semi-utopian bubble that has long been his domain.If music is a language, as Villalobos believes, Alcachofa is his first work of poetry. “I prefer a clear, understandable, calm voice in music,” he once said. “I don’t like fortissimos.” The “understandable” part may be hard to square with a record that begins with “Easy Lee,” an afterhours anthem whose lyrics, moaned through a Nord Lead vocoder, no one has ever quite been able to decipher beyond the titular phrase. This sets the tone for an album defined by oblique moods and loose, organically evolving arrangements. Emotions come in subtle shades, from the nervous edge of “Bahaha Hahi” to the quiet determination of “Quizás” (Spanish for “maybe”).Unlike so much neatly regimented dance music, these tracks unfurl according to the unconscious logic of improvisation, meandering serenely despite their brisk tempos, introducing elements that appear once and never return, and ending somewhere different from where they began. There are melodies, vocals, and hooks, but they’re upstaged by the sounds themselves—crystalline, impossibly tactile, deftly gelling mic-recorded acoustic sounds with electronic instruments (whose inventors Villalobos honors, along with his family and loved ones, in the album’s dedications). The percussion in particular is immaculate, with kick drums (when they appear) like beads of porcelain connecting his delicate structures. In a wise shuffle of the track order, Perlon’s reissue ends with “Waiworinao,” a DJ tool made almost entirely of samples of the Polish jazz bassist Krzysztof Ścierański, and a dazzling contrast to the lean electronics that come before it.Few artists manage such subtleties in club music, but it’s not surprising that Villalobos does. Rhythmic music has been one of his primary modes of self-expression since childhood. His parents, Chileans displaced to Germany by Pinochet’s coup (part of the ignominious legacy of the recently departed Henry Kissinger), raised him in a house full of South American music and spontaneous parties, where a young Ricardo might be handed a conga in an all-night percussion session. He proved a valuable addition to Frankfurt’s booming club scene in the 1990s—DJing, throwing parties, and making hypnotic house and minimal records that embodied a unique blend of influences: South American music, synth pop (he was a Depeche Mode super fan), kosmische bands like Kraftwerk and Can, and, later, the kind of jazz and classical that might appear on ECM (a label whose catalog he remixed, alongside Max Loderbauer, in 2011). Much of his adult life has followed a weekly cycle: a few days in the studio, then DJ gigs all weekend, rarely playing for less than three hours, and sometimes for eight or more. (“I prefer not to sleep,” he once told an interviewer. “I don’t like it so much.”)",Electronic,8.3
570,"The Detroit rapper tears into his creative partner’s thick beats like beef jerky, showcasing his fiercest raps yet. For Elzhi, every new song is an opportunity to prove just how much sharper his pen is than yours. The Detroit emcee means it in the true-school sense—after all, he comes from an era where the terms “pen” and “emcee” were sacred totems. Whether he’s rhyming about failed relationships or paying tribute to Nas’ Illmatic in the form of an entire LP, he relishes his status as a hypertechnical rapper with conceptual albums and a knack for cerebral storytelling.Elzhi’s style is rich and rigid, but its effectiveness hinges upon the beats he’s working with. Over the last five years, he’s gravitated toward albums helmed by a single producer. On 2018’s Jericho Jackson, Jamla Records producer Khrysis offered up stately boom-bap that shrouded Elzhi’s raps in a muted sepia tone; Brooklyn producer JR Swiftz gave 2020’s Seven Times Down Eight Times Up a lush, pulpy feel; and the soulful live embellishments on 2022’s Zhigeist recast the Detroit rapper and collaborator Georgia Anne Muldrow as Afrofuturistic jetsetters. With Heavy Vibrato, he joins forces with Oxnard producer Oh No, who offers up a feast of thick beats that Elzhi tears into like beef jerky.Oh No—best known as Madlib’s brother and half of the duo Gangrene with the Alchemist—is cut from the same traditionalist cloth as Elzhi. His love for sampling pulls him in strange directions; to keep his grimy sound fresh, he culls from obscure Swedish psychedelic rock records and Nintendo 64 video games. There’s a hazy ambience to his work, as if every beat emerged from the cracks of a sauna bench, but Heavy Vibrato cuts through the fog with sharp, jazzy arrangements. On “Say It Don’t Spray It,” the snare drums are enveloping, almost dubby next to clanging bells and synths; they softly rattle behind swirling piano and xylophone tones on “RIP (Radio International Programming)” and snap with a live player’s feel on “Fireballs.” These are among the eeriest—and cleanest—beats Oh No has ever created, throbbing and lurching with cartoonish flair.Vibrato is colorful and vibrant, and Elzhi matches that aura with nimble bars that don’t stray far from his lyrical comfort zone. There’s still concepts at play here, but the album-length theme of 2016’s Lead Poison has fizzled out; since then, he’s leaned on vignettes and looser motifs. Proper opening track “Trick Dice” is classic rap calisthenics, a space for Elzhi to shame lesser rappers and unfurl intricate bars for kicks: “Those who put they money where they chief were/Pushed outta Mother Earth before Father Time could bury them beneath her.” He goes a step further on late-album highlight “Fireballs,” offering haters nuclear-missile levels of wordplay over an expansive swirl of scuzzy bass and keys. There’s a buzz to the way his words connect and flow into each other when he’s just searching for a way to figuratively clear his throat—he could make even a run-on sentence sound good.",Pop,7.1
571,"Thirteen years after her landmark album Pink Friday, the pop-rap superstar aims to conjure and build on that moment with an ambitious 22-song statement that is a very mixed bag. Nicki Minaj’s superpower is her ability to adapt. In her 16-year career, she’s been a for-the-streets mixtape queen, a chrome-pink pop star, an empowered groundbreaker, and—using her formidable theater skills—a chameleonic character rapper, morphing into personas like Harajuku Barbie, Tyrone, Chun Li, and the beloved Roman Zolanski, all with the wittiest wordplay this side of Lil Wayne.The original Pink Friday—her first album after a string of phenomenal mixtapes in the late 2000s—shifted the industry upon its release in 2010, proving that she could weave a tapestry with her characters, sing her face off, and that sexist rap purism would be left in her dust. Nicki the Boss set records, became a global superstar, and casually shattered the male-rapper stronghold on the mainstream in a way that hadn’t been done since the heyday of Lil Kim and Foxy Brown. For all the belated recognition and chart dominance of women rappers today, it’s undeniable that Minaj was the beginning of a sea change. She was the blueprint for women rappers who didn’t have to be feminine mirrors of their male patrons, but could stand on their own.Pink Friday 2 aims to conjure and build on that moment in time, and to remind us—her fans, her haters, her mortal enemies—what she’s done for rap, especially women in rap. Like the original, Nicki masters the art of the quick change, jumping from persona to persona, genre to genre, putting her signature cadences on drill, pop, dancehall, afrobeats, R&B, Jersey club, and trap. Yet except for a few excellent tracks and verses peeking through, this 22-song album—unlike 2018’s Queen or even 2014’s bar-setting The Pinkprint—falls apart pretty quickly. While Minaj is still rapping valiantly—especially as Red Ruby Da Sleeze, a new persona introduced on the Diwali riddim-sampling single of the same name—the album’s intention is muddled through its scattershot production, which sounds less like genre innovation and more like an insidious ploy to worm its way into as many crevices on TikTok as possible.It didn’t have to be this way! Pink Friday 2 includes tracks about her emotional fortitude, her Trini and Caribbean pride, her unfuckwithable armor, and intimate reflections on her life. On the affecting album opener, “Are You Gone Already,” a Finneas production that samples Billie Eilish’s “when the party’s over,” she grapples with the pain of learning her father was killed by a hit-and-run driver in 2021, and reflects on her responsibility and love as a mother. She flexes her agility on tracks like “Beep Beep” and “Barbie Dangerous,” which conjure the much beloved Mixtape Nicki: the latter interpolates Biggie’s “Notorious Thugs” and includes the line, “Name a rapper that can channel Big Poppa and push out Papa Bear/Ho, I’m mother of the year.” Or on “RNB,” an otherwise middling track with Tate Kobang and Lil Wayne where she raps, “I keep his secrets/I let him beast it/Kissin’ on my thighs and my breast/He two-pieced it.” Yet on the same song, when Wayne raps, “’Bout to buy a fake booty for a real-ass bitch,” it’s an odious reminder that Minaj felt pressured to get ass shots at the beginning of her Young Money career—an example of context seeping into, and souring, the music.",Rap,6.5
572,"The Puerto Rican quartet blends streamlined psych pop, atmospheric chillout, and yacht-rock disco on a concept album about lovelorn dream states. With their 2018 debut album, Modo, Puerto Rico’s Epilogio staked out a thoroughly contemporary position within a lineage of Latin psych rock and disco. Founded a few years before, the quartet worked its way from smaller venues to touring Mexico at a time when rock was being eclipsed by Latin trap, standing out in their Geordi La Forge-esque visors and all-white tracksuits. Tracks like “Sonido Infinito,” “Submarina Club,” and “Otro Nivel” channeled inspirations from ’70s Argentine rockers Almendra and Pescado Rabioso alongside dream pop and acid jazz into sleek, subdued funk.Five years later, the group applies its retro fixations to more ambitious ends with Cromo Rx, a concept album about a special pill that lulls those who take it into a deep slumber filled with fantastical dreams. They lean into the setup with aplomb, using it to alchemize sounds and genres: bolero interludes sandwiched between surf-rock riffs; glam-metal guitar hooks and echoes of ’80s new wave that segue into somber emo.Following the expository “La Pastilla de Tus Sueños, Pt. 1” (“The Pill of Your Dreams, Pt. 1”), the horn fanfare of “Pirámide” kicks off the sojourn with a fusion of indie rock and electric sitar, courtesy of Peré Oudav. Peppered with references to heat, mirages, and pyramids, the song evokes a trippy desert landscape, an idea underlined by the René Laloux-inspired visuals of its music video. From that setting they shift to the pastoral ’60s harmonies of “Hangar,” whose folksy twangs make it easy to picture Epilogio performing from a quaint fairgrounds gazebo. “12AM,” in contrast, harnesses arena-rock energy with crisp drums and bluesy guitar licks before morphing into a sleek, Tame Impala-esque shuffle that underlines guitarist Marco Torres’ breezy croon.Epilogio have been releasing the bulk of Cromo Rx’s tracks as singles for a year now, and fittingly, the album feels like a collection of A-sides. “Circuito por Milán” and “Platicar” are tailor-made to kill live, so much so that they re-recorded the latter to include an extended jam they’d been tacking on at the end in concert. The ethereal ""Molecular"" marries funky wah-wah with chillout, while the solemn “Los Cuervos”—with guest vocals from Chango Menas, of the now-disbanded group Índigo—pulls back the sheet and confirms what’s really gnawing at Epilogio’s melancholy: heartbreak, of course, as ever. It’s all fun and games until you remember what you’re trying to run away from. Beneath fanciful lyrics sketching out the album’s dream world—filled with explorers, race car drivers, secret agents, and spacemen—lurks an underlying angst: These are adventures meant for two.",Rock,7.6
573,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit the album that made Rod Stewart a star, a rollicking and surprisingly grounded document of early ’70s folk-rock. 1. “I sincerely thought I was so complete”In 1971, at 26, Rod Stewart thought he was an old man. He’d been working as a musician since his late teens. In the preceding three and a half years, he sang on six albums alone and he hadn’t attained the success he craved. As Stewart mentions in Rod, his 2012 autobiography, no one intended for rock’n’roll to be a career; Paul McCartney said he’d give up music if he hadn’t hit big by 20. All around Stewart, his peers—the Rolling Stones, the Who, Led Zeppelin—had become global icons. And 27 literally felt like death, because in the previous 18 months, Jimi Hendrix, Brian Jones, and Janis Joplin had died at that age.By almost anyone else’s standards, Stewart was doing very well. He had a solo record deal while singing for the Faces, the most hyped band in the UK. He owned a home in London and a brand-new Marcos GT two-seater. The unabating bacchanal of the rock’n’roll lifestyle suited his appetites. It wasn’t sufficient. He wanted to be a star.Every Picture Tells a Story, Stewart’s third solo album, made him one. It’s the LP that launched him into a rarefied stratosphere of celebrity, the kind accompanied by wild rumors that sound like they were spread by the Marquis de Sade. But the opening six-minute title track doesn’t convey confidence, purpose, or craft—at least at first. Emphatic strums of G chords spangle up and down, in, through, and out the rich, hollow wood of a 12-string acoustic guitar. The winding melody lasts for a dozen seconds; the pluck of a string hangs there for a few more. Then the drums crash and a bold rasp shouts forth: “Spent some time feelin’ inferior, standin’ in front of my mirror.” Stewart sings the line declaratively, setting the scene and framing the perspective of an insecure young man. “Combed my hair in a thousand ways,” he continues, “but I came out looking just the same.”The musicians—Ron Wood on bass, electric, and acoustic 12-string guitar; fellow Faces keyboardist Ian McLagan on organ; pianist Pete Sears; and drummer Mick Waller—seem as if they’re learning the song while they’re playing it. Nothing is in lockstep. Stewart foregrounds the acoustic guitar so that it punches through the speaker. “Every Picture Tells a Story” is in 4/4 time, but Waller bashes off-beat during the moments Stewart isn’t singing, a disorienting force that mirrors the inexperience and uncertainty of the narrator.",Rock,9.4
574,"A new compilation surveys the period in Japan when Jamaican influences mixed with the opulent melodies and high-production gloss of city pop. In the 1980s, as Japan became an exporter of both culture and technology, budding scenes in the once insular nation began creating a local home for foreign sounds imported from afar. Among them was a collection of artists creating homegrown reggae music that honored the genre’s Jamaican roots. Tokyo’s leading disciples of Trenchtown included drummer Masahito “Pecker” Hashida, who recorded at Tuff Gong with Bob Marley himself, while the band Mute Beat drew heavily from reggae and dub to forge a sound that presaged acid jazz and trip-hop. The new compilation Tokyo Riddim 1976-1985 is not a snapshot of that scene. Instead, it’s a valuable collection of more pop-aligned, pseudo-reggae music masterminded by artists and producers who envisioned Caribbean influences amalgamating seamlessly with Japan’s own city-pop sound. These songs are more analogous to the English cod reggae artists of the same era—think UB40, the Police, and Paul McCartney—than the Jamaican pioneers they pilfered from.​​Often this influence manifests as simply a vibe, as though all involved were attempting to recreate the feeling of a half-remembered concert they had attended while journeying through Kingston. Tokyo Riddim 1976-1985 even begins with the sound of crashing waves, setting a seaside mood, before Miki Hirayama’s “Tsukikage No Nagisa” (“Moonlight Shadow at the Beach”) mixes the singer’s sophisticated vocal, typical of city pop, over some lazily strummed reggae guitar. A lot of the set moves at a similarly easygoing pace: On “Music,” Chu Kosaka—a rock artist whose reggae credentials include citing Jimmy Cliff’s House of Exile as his favorite album—deploys an appropriately hazy falsetto and voluptuous saxophone lead over a bassline as heavy as the setting sun.The producers are clearly unconcerned with adhering to the core tenets of reggae, and in some brashly experimental moments they blur genre lines even further. The second of two Hirayama tracks, “Denshi Lenzi” pinches the rhythm guitar and bassline from Marley’s “Natural Mystic,” but sets them against vocals doused in futuristic robo-pop vocoder effects. “Hittin’ Me Where It Hurts,” by Marlene, a Filipina singer tapped by Japanese talent recruiters to become a pop star, includes airy ba ba ba harmonies that evoke Latin jazz, adding hints of arcade electronica, clattering percussion, brass, and trippy vocal effects that fray Marlene’s flashy big-band-style performance into a fantastical, cross-cultural melange.​​As with a lot of city pop, the lyrics—some of which are in English—often come off as enjoyable, if lyrically imprecise, pastiches of Western love songs: Izumi “Mimi” Kobayashi’s “Lazy Love” includes such crumpled wordplay as, “Yes, I’ll let you go, yes, I’ll make you come/Baby, I’ll set you free, baby, I’ll make you leave.” Unexpectedly, Junko Yagami’s “Johannesburg” addresses South African apartheid by noting that the city’s beauty is betrayed by the injustice meted out on its people. Mostly sung in Japanese, the song nonetheless emulates Marley’s social-justice soul. It’s difficult to discern from Tokyo Riddim 1976-1985 alone if political engagement was a common thread of this odd corner of the city-pop sound—at just eight songs, the album offers only a glimpse. But within a broader narrative, these cuts showcase the omnivorous nature of a scene that repudiated Japan’s isolationist history and created exciting new hybrids in the process.",Time,7.2
575,"On an adventurous new album, the guitarist blends improvised performance with quixotic touches of found sound. James Elkington once confessed, “There’s a master plan somebody understands/And I wish that one was me.” And yet, the British-born, Chicago-based guitarist has always played like someone who knows exactly what he’s doing. His penchant for tasteful flourishes have led to collaborations with artists like Jeff Tweedy, Joan Shelley, and Richard Thompson, while his adventurous ear and graceful melodies have benefitted a diverse cast of experimental combos, including Eleventh Dream Day, Tortoise, and Brokeback. But on his solo albums, including 2017’s Wintres Woma and 2020’s Ever-Roving Eye, Elkington has presented himself as a songwriter rooted in the stately mold of classic British folk rock, filling each with songs you could slot alongside the autumnal gold of Pentangle and Fairport Convention.After the release of Ever-Roving Eye, Elkington envisioned his next album as a collection of solo guitar instrumentals. But as work stretched out, he hit a wall. Narrowing in on his 50th birthday and unsatisfied with his labored over progress, he began to wonder what other territory he might explore, looking to, as he puts it in the biographical notes, “un-paint myself out of the corner I had painted myself into.” So Elkington abandoned the project and started each day by recording a new improvisational piece, letting go of formal composition in favor of looseness and unfiltered ideas drawn from his subconscious. The result is Me Neither, a record that augments Elkington’s winsome folk with quixotic touches of found sound.Opener “No-Shows” sets the tone with a looping acoustic guitar melody set against chiming bells and resounding echoes that function like ersatz percussion. From there, Elkington layers on washes of fuzzed guitar and noise from a train roaring down the tracks. It’s a fitting welcome into this altered space, like Bert Jansch sitting in with Broadcast. Further surprises roll out in quick succession: the fluctuating waves of static distortion in “A Message for the Janesville Kings”; nearby chatter, gurgling water, and bird song in the jazzy “Look Spectral!”; something that sounds like whirling bicycle spokes on “Cup Cape.” These extra touches create an air of expansiveness, a sense of the world these songs inhabit. The outside finds its way in.Elsewhere, Elkington employs the more pronounced songwriting that marks his first two solo albums, albeit sans lyrics. “The 100-Faced Magma” and “New Red Masterpiece” are delicate instrumental ballads, evoking the patience of Nick Drake’s Pink Moon, while the title track dips into ambient country expanses, conjuring lonely highways and vast desert expanses, Elkington’s arcing acoustic guitar strums beset by far-off electric guitars that land somewhere between Neil Young and Robert Fripp. Most captivating is a skeletal and spooky reading of ABBA’s “The Winner Takes It All.” Sweeping aside the operatic grandeur of the original, Elkington communicates the heartbreak of the lyrics via a single austere guitar line, carefully plucked out and punctuated by breathy pauses. Like so much of Me Neither, it’s over before you expect, a brief but charming moment that vanishes just as you begin to recognize it. As a sideman, Elkington’s prowess has come from his ability to slide into a song and fill it out. With Me Neither, he gets a chance to pull compositions apart. From there, he arranges the fragments into a fascinating and gently kaleidoscopic whole. Following the master plan, it turns out, is overrated.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

576,"The Montreal duo’s scorching second album unites acid techno, future jazz, and hip-hop in service of incisive political punk. Pelada’s mantra is “love us or hate us, we don’t give a fuck.” Over the past decade, the Montreal-based duo of vocalist Chris Vargas and producer Tobias Rochman have fused punk aggression and politicized lyrics into a mutant strain of hardware techno. Four years have passed since their debut, and after parting ways with former label PAN, Pelada return with a second album that renders their hardcore punk politics even more incisive. Ahora Más Que Nunca (Now More Than Ever) sets the Colombian vocalist’s Spanish-language protest songs and empowerment anthems to ominous electronic beatscapes, matching them in intensity at every step.On 2019’s Movimiento Para Cambio (Movement for Change), Pelada’s explorations into cumbia and reggaeton sounded more like a disjointed string of singles than a structured collection. The duo is still dancing between acid techno, future jazz, and hip-hop, but on Ahora Más Que Nunca, the increased consistency of Rochman’s production synthesizes these sounds into a uniquely confrontational and genre-agnostic take on club music. Guest appearances from horrorcore rapper Backxwash and trumpeter Aquiles Navarro of Irreversible Entanglements complicate the classifications even further.Several core themes emerge from Vargas’ urgent electro-punk sermons. “Agua ≠ Mercancía” (“Water ≠ Merchandise”) calls out the Canadian government for its mismanagement of natural resources. “Latido de Extinción” (“Extinction Beat”) echoes the need to rise up against state and corporate greed, as Vargas shouts, “Estamos en tierra robada!” (“We are on stolen land!”) Album opener “La Gente Se Laventa” (“People Get Up”) calls for revolution “hoy, no mañana” (“today, not tomorrow”) before a beat switch arrives to propel Backxwash’s aggressive rhymes about eating their oppressors. “This dirty little life we live,” they spit, “it’s fight the rich, or go on till we ice these pricks.”As any activist will tell you, meaningful action is not possible without self-care. After a brief introduction about finding inner strength, “Ya Fue” (“It Was Already”) merges vocoder-laced vocals with Navarro’s wandering, echo-drenched horn, like Miles Davis in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. On “Pilas” (“Batteries”), Vargas sings about overcoming doubts and depression, reminding that “un mal día no te define” (“a bad day does not define you”). Their angrily enunciated lyrics pick up speed as bouncing rubber-ball synths are replaced by orchestral percussion samples, giving gravitas to this pissed-off pep talk.In the resigned yet resolved spoken-word passages of closer “Punto de no Retorno” (“Point of No Return”), Pelada argue that “la pobreza existe, no porque no podamos alimentar a los pobres, sino porque no podemos satisfacer a los ricos” (“poverty exists, not because we cannot feed the poor, but because we cannot satisfy the rich”). Yet perhaps the most persuasive moment is the ACAB anthem “Cerdo” (“Pig”), which concludes with cycling pianos reminiscent of John Carpenter’s Halloween theme. This album’s political slogans may not be Pelada’s alone, but bolstered by their unifying array of thumping beats, the horrors of colonialism become all the more real.",Electronic,7.7
577,"On its third album, the Spanish quartet adds complexity to its hooky brand of indie pop, fleshing out its arrangements and digging into darker themes. The first two albums by Spanish quartet Melenas exude pure joy. On 2017’s Melenas and 2020’s Días Raros, ebullient hooks and bright rhythms abound in infectiously catchy tunes. Their brand of energetic indie pop topped by crafty vocal harmonies is wide enough to encompass moments of reflection and even some darkness. But it’s hard to come away from either album without feeling uplifted.It would be wrong to say that Melenas’ new album, Ahora, isn’t also uplifting. The first single from the record, “Bang,” is as bouncy as it gets, sparked by a motorik beat, sprightly keyboards, and criss-crossing voices; the accompanying video shows the four band members literally skipping along to the tune. But Ahora is more nuanced and more textured. Melenas have added complexity to their music without abandoning their hooks or their vibrant spirit. In essence, they’re doing what they’ve always done, but on a deeper level than before.Part of that new depth comes down to arrangements and production. Synthesizers are more prominent on Ahora, sometimes layered with guitars and drums, sometimes taking the lead. On the wistful “Two Passengers,” a rising keyboard provides both backbone and pace until the band’s unison vocals melt into the glistening notes. Those blended voices are another reason why Ahora is denser than previous Melenas efforts. Nearly every track includes more than one vocalist, and often all four members sing. These harmonies are so frequent that the music feels collective and multi-dimensional, folding in an abundance of angles and numerous shades.Ahora’s lyrical themes are similarly deep. The title means “now,” and most songs deal with the idea of time—particularly appreciating the present and processing the past. The band confronts the subject head on: On the second track, the ear-worming “K2,” they admit, “Cuando miro atrás no sé medir la distancia/El tiempo que pasó ¿a quién se lo dí?” (“When I look back I can’t measure the distance/The time that passed, who did I give it to?”). In “Mal,” time is a bandit in the form of wasted effort: “Cuánta vida/Se quedó atrás/Cuántos planes/Por trabajar” (“How much life/Was left behind/How many plans/Because of work”).As direct as their lyrics can be, Melenas can be subtle, too. On Ahora’s catchiest tune, the stair-stepping “1986,” the dangerous attraction of a flame becomes a metaphor for fascination and repulsion. The wistful “Flor de la frontera” beholds the miraculous way a plant dies and re-emerges every year, while the elegiac “Promesas” measures time by how often plans get pushed down the road.",Rock,7.7
578,"On a collaborative release, the grindcore and shoegaze bands team up for the rare metal album whose greatest virtue is its delicacy. There are two Full of Hells. There’s the Full of Hell known for making tightly wound and carefully plotted grindcore on the albums they release under their own name. And there’s the Full of Hell known for their ability to alter their signature sound to the specifications of another band’s music. On their previous collaborative albums, you can hear them scraping and squeezing the aluminum waves of Merzbow, the freeform sludge of the Body, and the doom metal of Primitive Man. The prettiness of Nothing’s dirtbag shoegaze—its haziness, the defeatist riffing, the way the songs move with the oblivious sway of Audrey Horne—isn’t an obvious stylistic match. But on their collaborative album, When No Birds Sang, Nothing’s strolling pace forces Full of Hell to choose their steps carefully, while Full of Hell’s ferocity and ear for detail corrode some of Nothing’s natural beauty. Like all great collaborations, it comes across as the work of a single band and it’s impossible to imagine either group making this record on their own.If Full of Hell and Nothing sound like they see eye to eye on When No Birds Sang, it could be because they were actually looking at one another. The full ensemble—Full of Hell’s Dylan Walker, Spencer Hazard, Dave Bland, and Sam DiGristine and Nothing’s Domenic Palermo and Doyle Martin—set up shop in Ocean City, Maryland, and wrote together in person, rather than sending demos back and forth. The method gives the album a sense of focus, even as it ventures into new territory for both acts, and their shared commitment to vulnerability tenderizes even the hardest blows.When No Birds Sang highlights the depression that’s always lurking within both bands’ heaviness. Opener “Rose Tinted World” is structured around a thousand-foot-tall Black Sabbath riff from which Walker launches his scream; he’s consistently one of extreme music’s most inventive and compelling vocalists, and when words fail him mid-line, he transitions into a foaming snarl. It’s a brutal opening, with feedback whipping around its edges and a rhythm that could turn granite to powder. But when cheery samples of daytime TV begin to filter in, spilling over one another in their eagerness to insist on the bright happiness of the day—“Miles and miles of sunshine,” gushes one anchor—their chipper attitude recasts the song’s viciousness. Rather than a show of strength, the huge darkness feels dwarfed by the relentlessly empty face of false optimism.Palermo takes the lead on “Like Stars in the Firmament.” It’s a gauzy slowcore prayer, the ensemble doing just enough to give Palermo the support he needs. “I don’t wanna die,” he sings, his voice soft with tragedy. Rather than throw a cloak of compression over the song to mimic intimacy, producer Will Putney gives the instruments space, allowing DiGristine’s fretless bass to gulp with Palermo as he sings about the flames of hell licking the gates of heaven. Later, in “Spend the Grace,” a scrape of guitar and sigh of feedback cycle around Palermo’s vocal in a sketchy loop, moaning in and out of dissonance and disrupting the angelic tone. It’s the kind of detail Full of Hell would normally gouge into the body of a song; here, their etching deepens the shadows in an already stately sculpture.When No Birds Sang is the rare metal album whose greatest virtue is its delicacy. Peer into the distance of “Wild Blue”’s icy grace and see the malfunctioning electronics crackling away. Or listen to the sing-songy chords of “Rose Tinted World”’s coda mimicking the breathiness of a typical Nothing vocal, and how the cascading morning-show samples embody the noise and anger of Walker’s delivery. Functionally, it’s a duet between two of the most distinctive vocalists in metal in which neither opens their mouth: a fitting high point on an album that shows Full of Hell and Nothing pushing one another into new ways of using their voices.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

579,"Teaming up with Pale Blue singer Elizabeth Wight, the Brooklyn producer explores love and heartbreak in moody tracks that pair back-room house grooves with bedroom introspection. For Detroit-born, Brooklyn-based producer Lauren Flax, the dancefloor is a space to work through trauma and experience joyful catharsis. This philosophy crystallizes in dazzling shape on the Liz & Lauren EP, recorded with Elizabeth Wight of 2MR labelmate Pale Blue on vocals. Flax channels her “sad, horny ‘’90s teenage raver” self into four songs (and one remix) that explore love, infatuation, and the dire state of the world today in improbably anthemic fashion.Flax and Wight first appeared together in 2020, when Flax remixed Pale Blue’s “Breathe,” the title track of an EP that used tough-edged acid-house production and Wight’s hushed tones to explore the impact of domestic abuse. Inspired by her remix’s melodic, surreal, and rather unsettling style, Flax shifted away from the robust Detroit acid of her earlier releases to deliver 2021’s Out of Reality, a record that reflected her disappointment at humanity’s lack of progress in a gothic house style.The Liz & Lauren EP is cut from the same cloth. Desolate chord sequences meet acidic scraps to create contemplative electronic moods that exist somewhere between the dancefloor and the after party. The BPMs, busy bass drums, and clattering breaks incite bodily motion; but the bone-weary vocal delivery makes the listener want to slip back into the comfort of a warm armchair. “Fix Everything” is a reaction to critical issues from the rise of religious extremism to global warming, and a sense of fatigue is audible in the song’s call for change.There’s nothing here that would have felt out of place among the softer side of Detroit techno or the early-’90s progressive house it later inspired. The breakbeats and blue-note chord changes of “Fix Everything” and “I’d Risk It All to Be With You” are reminiscent of Future Sound of London’s progressive rave heartbreaker “Papua New Guinea” or onetime Andrew Weatherall proteges One Dove. The chugging bass drum and synth riffs of “I Don’t Want to Hurt You” call back to Spooky, a London duo whose early releases helped establish progressive house’s signature mixture of melody, atmosphere, and rhythm.But thematically—and in terms of overall feel—the Liz & Lauren EP is very much in its own field. Contrasting with the upbeat drive of much club music, the dark subject matter and Wight’s pained-to-the-point-of-tears delivery are reminiscent of the emo rap of Lil Peep et al., albeit rendered far more tenderly. Wight is capable of expressing subtle emotional shifts with the slightest crack of her voice, and her delivery dances an unlikely pas de deux with Flax’s beats, landing halfway between ASMR and the rave. (The “MASC Remix” of “I’d Risk It All to Be With You,” which does away with most of Wight’s vocals, is a far more conventional and less rewarding club number.)",Electronic,7.6
580,"On its debut EP, the sax-and-drums duo forges a signature sound that proves anti-pop experimentation can be a real good time. This past September, O. were the first act to perform at the 10th-anniversary showcase of South London indie label Speedy Wunderground. While the label—which has released music from black midi, Squid, and Lewsberg—has grown far beyond its mission to be a quick-turnaround singles factory, O. are perhaps the most demonstrative showroom model for that expedient, plug ‘n’ play philosophy. Formed two years ago, the duo was already opening large theater concerts when they could still count their gigs on one hand. With their debut EP, O. make an even more convincing case for why you should have them kick off your show: For an often-abrasive instrumental band, they know how to start a party.As the term “post-punk” has increasingly become shorthand for aggrieved shout-speak and stern-faced severity, O. reassert one of the genre’s original, oft-overlooked facets: Anti-pop experimentation can be a lot of fun. The four songs on Slice hit you with a delightfully disorienting array of sounds. At various points, you might think you’re hearing a hockey-rink buzzer, or a swarm of insects, or a doom-metal drone, or a squawking sea animal, or a police siren, or a brown-note synth frequency, or an incoming ocean liner, or a tectonic-plate shift. And that sonic spectrum is all the more impressive when you consider all those effects emanate from a single source: Joseph Henwood’s baritone saxophone, which, when filtered through Speedy figurehead Dan Carey’s production wizardry, is rendered equally boisterous and monstrous. Henwood’s sax attack is O.’s undeniable focal point, the novelty that would make an unsuspecting black midi fan heading toward the venue bar stop and wonder, “What the fuck is that!?!” before turning around and making a beeline for the stage. But drummer Tash Keary’s frenetic stickwork is the mortar that holds O.’s wall of sound together, ensuring a harmonious balance of improvisation and rock-solid composition.On Slice, O. are already in the enviable position of possessing both a signature aesthetic and the confidence to stretch it out without worrying about losing their sense of identity. Where jazz instrumentation in a punk context often favors atonal skronk and splatter, O.’s brand of sax ‘n’ violence largely forsakes free-form anarchy for a more disciplined attack that rallies around muscular riffs and fleet-footed rhythms. Slice’s opening title track burrows a tunnel from The Mudd Club dancefloor to a Reading Festival mosh pit, with the song’s aggro-funk breakdowns and build-ups betraying the influence of Primus on the UK’s current post-punk pack. By contrast, on “Moon,” the duo wades into dubby waters without losing their sense of mischief—even as the beat slows and Henwood’s snark-charmer melodies start to ooze like molasses, Keary continues to ride her hi-hat and kick-pedal as if leading a disco band. Not surprisingly, the most mid-tempo tune, “Grouchy,” is the least interesting one of the bunch, its mutant-metal grind suggesting a pub-rock King Crimson. But the duo save their best for last with “ATM,” which affords them the extra space to deploy their full arsenal of effects for maximal drama. Over six white-knuckled minutes, the duo seesaws between ticking time-bomb tension and earthquaking eruptions, as if waging a war between their avant-garde inclinations and their irrepressible urge to just rock the fuck out. And from that chaotic collision, O. forge a sound as unmistakable as their name is unGoogleable.",Rock,7.0
581,"The Brazilian DJ-producer translates the livewire energy of his viral videos into an album of impish, wildly unpredictable baile funk. Rio de Janeiro-born producer DJ Ramon Sucesso has evangelized experimental music fans around the world to baile funk with frenetic viral videos in which he pounds away at MIDI pads and distorts turntable scratches into banshee wails. Each Sucesso video has a signature visual touch: When the bass hits, the camera vibrates in an uncontrollable fit, almost like you’re smack dab inside the pounding heart of a subwoofer. There is no baile funk without the raucous underground bailes that gave birth to the sound, and these gonzo clips capture the genre’s aliveness better than any conventional album could.The 21-year-old DJ’s official catalog is pretty slim. He has produced a few more straightforward funk tracks, including on his fairly subdued collaborative EP Contenção with vocalist MC Torugo, which mixes Latin trap beats with sparse conga drums. As evidenced by the success of his videos, Successo’s real strength is not creating sounds from scratch, but manipulating existing sounds until they become new. His new 12-inch Sexta dos Crias—a dubplate mix with two 15-minute cutting and chopping frenzies on either side—highlights not just the gymnastic dexterity of Sucesso’s fingers, but the possibilities of the DJ controller as an instrument unto itself.“Sexta dos Crias” is the slightly more restrained half, but it’s still wildly unpredictable, full of cartoonish Fruity Loops effects, jagged samples, and kick drums that chirp like a chorus of frogs. One of Successo’s trademarks is the “beat bolha,” or “bubble beat,” a squishy drum effect that sounds like he’s mashing buttons made of slime. Voices are chopped into staccato chants while he drags the tempo knob up and down on his controller, manipulating the speed of the beat and your body like a gleeful puppetmaster. Sucesso’s own trigger-happy style is influenced by Brazilian mixmasters like DJ Zullu, who bring turntablist Olympics into the era of MIDI pads and Serato controllers.The B-side—“Distorcendo a Realidade,” which literally translates to “Distorting Reality”—is a blur of pure sensation. Successo throws you off balance, always impishly toying with the pitch or introducing a chaotic new element into the mix—wailing horns, chiptune blasts, and pounding bass—until sounds are felt more than heard. Distorted voices laced with a dubby tinge of echo chatter over one another, competing for your attention. Words are reduced to percussive syllables, as Sucesso twists guttural voices into beatboxers in his distorted orchestra. When he spins the turntable, it doesn’t sound like a scratch, but a squeal or even a scream, as tracks dissolve one to another with a forceful squeegee wipe.",Electronic,7.7
582,"Nina Nastasia’s new project with guitarist Jeff MacLeod is a lonesome, deliberate meditation on memory, freedom, and loss. As a young girl from Southern California, Nina Nastasia found her sense of freedom on the Pacific Coast Highway, a stretch of road that promised picnics on the beach, lazy heat, and days that felt oceanic and undefined. Nastasia was confronted with freedom once again in her mid-50s, when she relearned to drive and returned to the Pacific Coast Highway in search of a home that no longer existed. Jolie Laide, Nastasia’s new self-titled project with guitarist Jeff MacLeod, is a kind of travelogue that traces the line between freedom and empty aimlessness: a child’s oceanside liberty that becomes an adult’s existential terror.Prior to her trip, Nastasia had lived the majority of her adult life in New York City, sharing a small apartment with her partner and musical collaborator Kennan Gudjonsson. From the late ’90s to the mid-2000s, she earned a cult following for her songwriting—part gothic, part Americana, full of emotions that confused and contradicted one another. John Peele and Steve Albini counted Nastasia among their favorite musicians. She released her sixth album in 2010 and then, for over a decade, seemed to disappear. In 2022, she released Riderless Horse, her first album in 12 years, which was written in the immediate aftermath of her partner’s death and partially explained her absence. Riderless Horse was a spartan, frenzied retrospective of the couple’s complicated years together, plainly and painfully transposing Nastasia’s grief.She re-learned to drive and soon after reached out to MacLeod, a musician she’d met some 20 years earlier, when he played with the dark dream-pop outfit Cape May. MacLeod is a largely improvisational guitarist, riffing on and subverting well-worn Americana tropes. The electric guitar features sporadically across Nastasia’s previous output, but it’s at the center of the mix on her first project with MacLeod; his playing adds a sense of place and cultural topography to Nastasia’s cross-country roadtrip. On Jolie Laide, MacLeod digs into the repertoire of American popular song to represent West Coast musical history and dredges up sludgier tones for Nastasia’s desert dirges. His guitar adds a sense of sweetened dread to Nastasia’s emotional realism, an inventive expression of her internal world.“Back to the west,” Nastasia begins the album, singing in her breeziest voice. MacLeod’s guitar is similarly buoyant, but each upstroke introduces a sense of creeping dread. The songs’ lumbering sense of tension is keenist on “Away Too Soon,” a song that Nastasia and MacLeod perform with a touch of heaviness, as if trying and failing to drag themselves out of a dream, searching for a satisfying burst of energy that never comes. Nastasia’s voice is like a stress ball; no matter how much pressure she applies, it always returns to its original, equipoised form. Similarly, MacLeod’s guitar goes back and forth between major and minor, two oppositional forces canceling out.",Rock,7.4
583,"On his latest tape, the Rochester rapper softens his most outlandish barbs. He’s still magnetic, but the sluggish beats sometimes interfere with his oddball flows. RXK Nephew and Harry Fraud shine as a duo once the topic of steak arises. On “Hunnid on the Dresser,” a highlight from their new mixtape Life After Neph, the Rochester rapper only gets one diss off before he’s distracted by a slab of sizzling meat; soon, he segues into a cooking session so intense that his wrist snaps off like Thing in the Addams Family. Life After Neph is full of the rapper’s oddball pop culture references and weirdo energy, but it also reflects his throw-everything-at-the-wall release strategy. (Check his YouTube channel: Chances are he dropped a new song today, and that it doesn’t sound much like yesterday’s). Measured subtlety was an asset on The Onederful Nephew, his June tape with DJ Rude One, but here the beats feel overly polished. Instead of offering ample grooves for Neph to settle into, the production on Life After Neph is too slippery for his signature flows to get traction.Fraud is a versatile collaborator; he has made a career curling his samples to fit around different creative partners’ styles. At his best, Fraud’s moderate touch accentuates Neph’s booming register, keeping the beat steady under his tumbling verses. Neph sounds 12 feet tall over the eerie chorus of “How I’m Coming”; he is equally in command on the mellower “RX Instructions.” The atmospheric “Hunnid on the Dresser” is prime real estate for Neph to take a more conversational approach to the chaotic one-liners that made “American Tterroristt” a classic (who else threatens Santa with a hammer?) As he’s started to become the boss of his own life, Neph says he’s tempering the volatile Slitherman persona that drove his early output. On Life After Neph, he raps about innocuous subjects like holiday discounts and bowling over sparkly loops, easy jazz flips, and even the interpolated melody of a Tears for Fears hit.The album’s highlight is the final track, “Top Chef Neph.” Over ’80s-style synths outfitted with 808 claps, a sweating Neph calls on his girl to help him whip up another feast of epic proportions: Tomahawk steak, a shark-filled seafood boil, and a loaded baked potato for good measure. The production kicks up the punchiness of the earlier cut “Dub 4 U”; you can feel Neph catching his stride as he fires away on matters of taste. There’s even a glimpse of his affinity for conspiracy theories: “Shut up, your food was 3D-printed.”Although it’s fun hearing Neph, a father himself, embrace dad-coded pleasures like prowling Home Depot for a Blackstone grill, the energy level sometimes suffers with a producer as laid-back as Fraud. His sunny sample flips were a trampoline for Kamaiyah and Jay Worthy earlier this year, but richer beats on tracks like “Authority Figure” and “Gotta Eat” can weigh Neph down. Life After Neph benefits from the same focus and short tracklist DJ Rude One brought to The Onederful Nephew, but the latter had an ember at its center that’s missing here.Still, “Top Chef Neph” ends the project on a sharp, silly high note that reveals how Neph might sustain his artistic momentum, if and when he gets tired of sharing a new song nearly every day. As he settles into new responsibilities—he released his proper debut studio album this year, the first project he recorded completely sober, and has plans for his own label—Neph is still figuring out how to translate his overflowing verve into a more benign package. It’s not a Michelin-star recipe yet, but with Fraud, Neph manages to carve out space for the outlandish barbs and hollered metaphors that bring his most eager disciples back to YouTube each morning.",Rap,6.8
584,"Unified by its abundant lo-fi charm and with lyrics referencing the Butthole Surfers, Dexedrine, and Taco Bell, the squirrelly New York alt-country duo sounds more playfully idiosyncratic than ever. For two people in a city of eight million, Frog garnered a respectable New York following in their early years. But the Queens alt-country duo found fandom—real fandom, where people queue to buy your music and the faces in the front row aren’t your longtime friends—overseas. Audio Antihero, a British boutique label that signed the band after discovering their 2013 debut record, boosted Frog enough to warrant a full-fledged UK tour before they ever plotted a regional U.S. leg.Since then, Frog have spent the past decade enjoying life as a cult favorite. When not going for $250 on the resale market, their records draw comparisons to Townes Van Zandt and Silver Jews—fitting, as the late David Berman once wrote Frog a letter of admiration—while smudging the edges of barren indie rock, low-key emo, and hearty Americana. In the lead-up to Grog, the band’s fifth album and first in four years, their situation changed. Singer-guitarist Daniel Bateman moved to New Rochelle and welcomed twins, while longtime drummer-bassist Tom White moved to England and was replaced by Daniel’s brother Steve Bateman. The new album kicks off the band’s fraternal era, but Frog’s sound remains as squirrelly as ever.Sounding as if they were still holed up in their parents’ garage playing for nobody but themselves, Daniel and Steve Bateman are all unbridled inspiration and freeform spontaneity, be it the last-minute glockenspiel in “Ur Still Mine” or the spectral piano haunting “Goes w/o Saying.” Their comfort with one another is audible. Daniel namedrops Butthole Surfers and Metro-North tickets with the tongue-in-cheek tone of someone fluent in the shared language of a sibling canon. When he opts for a more straightforward approach in “DOOM SONG,” a slog of discordant chords and ominous cymbal crashes, Daniel encourages his brother to cut loose: “Take pride, young bro/You should sing as in a dream/Stop the show, break a string.”Daniel’s emotional delivery has always been one of Frog’s strongest assets, and that still holds true with Grog. On “Maybelline,” he sings about a Dexedrine-dosed woman in a car crash like he’s pouring one out for someone he’s known all his life. He injects “New Ro,” an ode to his new hometown, with vocal harmonies to match the retro romance of his banjo plucks. As if the simplicity of how he sings the love song “So Twisted Fate” wasn’t enough, it evolves into a voice note of his children attempting to sing while a synth chord morphs into focus. There’s no exact science to Daniel’s singing, but his untrained voice has a purity that’s difficult to fake and moving to hear.",Rock,7.4
585,"Blending triumphant jams with the mind-bending repetition of minimalism, the instrumental outfit offers a leaderless, collective shout of defiance. As of late 2023, there are at least eight images of the Kool-Aid Man scattered across Sunwatchers’ Bandcamp page. He’s an unlikely mascot for an anti-capitalist experimental rock band, but ever since he appeared on the cover of the group’s 2019 album Illegal Moves in full-on Braveheart regalia standing triumphant over a mutilated corpse of Uncle Sam, his presence within the band’s own cheeky branding has been ubiquitous. Naming their 2020 follow-up Oh Yeah? was a not so subtle nod in his direction. The group’s tongues are shoved firmly into their cheeks, and the blatant IP theft aligns with their anarchist-leaning politics. But the exuberant, barrier-breaking energy of their appropriated brand ambassador is mirrored in the unchecked jubilation at the heart of the band’s music.Sunwatchers exist in a lineage of musicians and performers creating politically radical work that cherishes the spirit of invention and is charged with hopeful defiance. Like the Bread and Puppet Theater, they construct a homegrown spectacle that is viscerally entertaining; like the Art Ensemble of Chicago, they use jazz as the groundwater that feeds a holistic practice of playfully and provocatively challenging artistic norms. As an instrumental band, Sunwatchers convey all of this through sound alone, countering their triumphant melodies with blasts of saxophone skronk and the time-bending repetition of minimalism. Think of it as solidarity fuel: a jolt of revelry to replenish the spirit of those engaged in the daily struggle of existence and resistance.Since the beginning of the pandemic, Sunwatchers have been notably less prolific than over the previous half-decade. Music Is Victory Over Time is the quartet’s first album in over three years, and their approach has shifted in subtle ways. The valleys are now just as potent as the peaks, and the darkness at the margins is more apparent, if still largely kept at bay. The relatively understated “Foams” plays out like the first moments of the jam section of the Grateful Dead’s “Playing in the Band” expanded into a shimmering ebb and flow of electric guitar arpeggios. Closer “Song for the Gone” punctuates the album with a wistful tribute to lost friends that climaxes in a three-chord refrain—a rare retreat into traditional song form.The group sounds most dialed in when they focus on a single musical phrase and push it to a breaking point. The opening melody to “World People” feels cribbed from a game show (or perhaps an ’80s Ornette Coleman record with Prime Time) until it begins to contract and expand simultaneously, a short arpeggiated phrase building in intensity until it explodes into a glorious two-chord blowout. The wide-eyed, flowing triplets played by saxophonist Jeff Tobias on “Tumulus” become full-cheeked bleats by the song’s end. It’s in listening to these shifting, evolving pieces that the album’s title begins to come into focus: While being swept up in the music, listening closely to the way it moves from points A to B to Q, the slippery, untamed flow of time seems dictated by the pliable swirl of sounds rather than the unflinching tick of the clock. Music Is Victory Over Time, like so much of the Sunwatchers catalog, creates the mindset in which revolutionary impulses and ideas can flourish—one driven by patience and passion in equal measure. Their music is a leaderless, collective shout of defiance, each element working in tandem to rethink how music moves and how it moves the listener.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

586,"On a fun but monotonous EP, the Detroit dance-music duo stops the clock at the party’s peak. You’re in the club so late your limbs have melted into sweaty spaghetti. You could collapse from exhaustion, but the lights and fog and music keep you levitating. Snow Strippers songs are based solely on evoking this tremulous state of perpetual climax. Like 100 gecs and Frost Children, the Detroit duo continues in the hipster tradition of rediscovering and rewiring the discarded passé. Their focus: lurid, cheap-sounding EDM pop. Their music’s been called electroclash, but it’s more like electroflash: vocal electronica overclocked to a shrill and peaky breaking point.Vocalist Tatiana Schwaninger and Graham Perez, a producer with a past life making beats for underground rappers like SoFaygo, have worked as Snow Strippers for a couple years now. This spring’s breakout April Mixtape 3 is like a Dance Dance Revolution soundtrack for moonwalking cyborgs: a strobing blitz of neon melodies and tinny shrieks. Their music slots nicely into a zeitgeist of Crystal Castles reappreciation and viral hits like laura les’ “Haunted,” but they also took pleasure in mutating their core sound in intriguing ways, like mashing the vocals with robotic ad-libs or slowing the pace to a glistening stomp-trot. On the duo’s new EP Night Killaz Vol. 1, they juice their garish dance sound even more, showcasing the music’s overheated thrills as well as its diminishing returns.Snow Strippers’ music is a piñata of pastiche, modeled after the gothic unease of SALEM, the shivering chaos of Crystal Castles, and the campy heart-rush of DJ Sammy. But it’s also seamless and stupidly fun. Even neurotic genre purists who scold PinkPantheress for trilling over UK garage classics will get swept up by Snow Strippers’ tidal wave of hardstyle kicks and pleading vocals. Detonating with a blinding shock, “Just Your Doll” will whip anyone in blast radius into a frenzy. “Cautious” throttles like a deep-fried Cascada song, Schwaninger’s helium-high cries fluttering like’s she running from an evil monster. At its best, the music smacks with the greasy goodness of 3 a.m. pizza.The issue is that Snow Strippers don’t have anywhere else to go. They landed on one strong idea—but only one. After the hypnotic first half, the tape fizzles out into a hazy locked groove. The lightshow synths of “Just a Hint” and “Touching Yours” sound exhaustingly similar, and Schwaninger’s vocals dissolve into a shiny-silver blur. Even “Comin Down” doesn’t offer a reprieve from the onslaught. Where the original electroclash scene deployed snarky humor and prurient imagery against the cushy mainstream club cultures of the time, this music isn’t rebelling against anything. The duo seems to have little to say, an artistic manifesto that boils down to: It’s a laugh, it’s euphoric, let’s get lit on a dark street. But when it stops being fun, the music turns into a rave-by-rote charade.",Electronic,6.0
587,"For decades, the Mississippi septuagenarian has self-released idiosyncratic fusions of blues, bebop, zydeco, ambient, and modern composition. This reissue confirms him as a true American original. For decades, David Michael Moore has been composing, songwriting, inventing his own instruments, and making albums that almost no one hears. He hails from the tiny riverside town of Rosedale, Mississippi, where he’s been playing since the 1970s and self-releasing his music under a variety of aliases since the ’90s. In 2021, the boutique label Ulyssa encountered his work and began a reissue campaign. You can imagine their excitement when they found it. Moore’s songs are sly and surreal documents of everyday profundity, with the mysteriously resonant imagery of mid-’60s Bob Dylan and the breezy equanimity of J.J. Cale. His instrumental compositions touch on blues, bebop, zydeco, ambient, and modernist classical music. And he plays them all on instruments like the homemade buzz box and the dog-bone xylophone. At 70-something years young, he’s a genuine American original, like a Mississippi Moondog.The primarily instrumental Adagio Fishing, recorded in 1994, is the second in Ulyssa’s series of reissues, and the first re-release of material that Moore initially conceived as an album, following last year’s excellent Flatboat River Witch, a compilation of highlights from across his catalog. “Birth of Love (A Major Adagio),” Adagio Fishing’s opening track, might give new listeners the wrong idea about what sort of artist he is. Five and a half minutes of luxuriant synthesized strings, with chord changes whose ambiguous yearning could soundtrack an alternate-universe Twin Peaks, it’s not entirely unlike the sort of dusty private-press new age that’s kept the lights on at various reissue labels over the last decade or so, albeit with an unusually rich harmonic palette for that style. Moore returns to this devotional mode a few times on Adagio Fishing, but on the whole the album is a lot stranger than its introduction suggests, and better for it.“My Prosperity Package,” the second piece, opens with an audio play of sorts. We hear a charismatic radio preacher, evidently recorded and sampled from the Mississippi airwaves, and a helium-voiced regular Joe who seems to be listening to the sermon (presumably Moore himself with a pitch-shifting effect). The preacher promises deliverance from poverty and strife, and the listener starts murmuring his assent. But it’s hard to tell if he really means it: There’s something puckish and sarcastic in his squeaked uh huhs and alrights, like maybe he knows the guy on the radio is a fraud, and he’s mocking him by playing along. Before the sketch can reach a resolution, Moore interrupts it with a brief, elliptical piano solo, its chords first strutting low and bluesy and then becoming vaporous and impressionistic as they ascend. It’s difficult to know what to make of “My Prosperity Package,” but it has the feeling of a thematic signpost, in part because it contains some of Adagio Fishing’s only legible words. In both the music and the dialogue, it holds the celestial in tension with the earthbound, reaching for transcendence in one moment and laughing at the very idea in the next.",Folk,8.0
588,"Multi-instrumentalists Ramin Rahni and Ariyan Basu formulate intricate art rock with unusual time signatures and impossible-to-predict textures. If mathematics or advanced musical theory are not your strong suit, then Confidence Freaks Me Out might make an intimidating first impression. The second album from Tar Of, the Brooklyn-based duo of multi-instrumentalists Ramin Rahni and Ariyan Basu, is defined by unusual time signatures and impossible-to-predict textures that only occasionally tumble in the direction of pop songcraft. Like an uber-nerd going long on their latest obsession, Confidence Freaks Me Out takes some time to warm to, warding off those unwilling to sift through the discordance.But Tar Of aren’t here to bore you. As they narrate in an Instagram post describing the creation of the album cover, the duo collaborated with a mathematician and a felt artist to visualize the 11/8 time signature of lead single “Amused by Their Comment” as a cone of equal proportions, sliced to reflect the song’s 2-1-3-2-1-3 rhythmic patterning. The cone then reappears as the party hats that Rahni and Basu wear in press photos and in the icing on a Confidence Freaks Me Out-shaped cake. Instead of treating nerdiness like a members-only club, Tar Of want to invite you to celebrate.Confidence Freaks Me Out charts a dizzying path through thickets of Reichian repetition, spacious, circular dance tracks like Kate NV’s, and the orchestral chamber pop of Cate Le Bon, with dashes of Animal Collective-esque vocal harmonics familiar from the duo’s earlier records. “Amused by Their Comment” eloquently captures the shambolic spirit, assembling layers of toy piano, sawtooth synth, guitar, trumpet, saxophone, clarinet, and zurna, a double reed woodwind instrument often used in Assyrian folk music. Each instrument seemingly follows its own rhythmic dictates, latticing into a danceable pattern as improbable as Thom Yorke’s in “Lotus Flower.” On “Berry,” muted glockenspiel, an autoharp played with chopsticks, and the sound of a cracked La Croix can create a dreamy instrumental palette for whimsical lyrics about “my toot Feri,” melding the Farsi word for mulberry (toot) with the name of Basu’s grandmother, Feri. The interwoven instrumental and lyrical nods to Iran, detailed in behind-the-scenes Instagram posts, are a loving testament to the duo’s shared cultural roots.Though Tar Of’s kinesthetic quest for repetition often seems to struggle against itself, the fission generated is rewarding. Their competing sensibilities are best articulated on “Uh Oh,” as woodwind instruments swirl atop an off-kilter prepared piano beat before resolving into staccato bursts of clarinet, viola, and synth—a fleeting reminder of rhythmic stability grounding the chaos. On “Garbage In,” they force themselves to write a straightforward chorus at 120 bpm and conjure simple beauty, even as the lyrics—“In the season’s midst, fiction breathes a bit hot (too hot)”—gesture at natural disaster.",Rock,7.1
589,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit a  2007 album that permanently altered the pop-punk landscape and marked the arrival of the ambitious and brilliant Hayley Williams. Sitting at her computer as a Southern teenager, with anger, confusion, sadness, and God, Hayley Williams opened a web browser, seeking answers: What is emo? “I totally researched the term ‘emo’ before I knew what it was,” Williams told Rolling Stone in 2008, a year after she and her band Paramore became the subculture’s new studded-belt poster children with their breakthrough second album, Riot! “There were websites like Howtobeemo.com… I became so obsessed with punk bands like Sunny Day Real Estate and Mineral that I started doing all sorts of research.”Kids search for a reason. By her pre-teen years, Williams had seen a lot. She has said her earliest childhood memory was standing, at age 4, between her feuding parents who were soon to divorce. Later, Williams and her mother fled her abusive stepdad, relocating from Meridian, Mississippi to Franklin, Tennessee, living between a hotel and a trailer, with the support of friends and a local church. “Mom and I ran away as I was turning 13,” Williams The New Yorker this year. “I knew almost immediately, when we got past the state line—now my life is starting.”On her first day of school in 2002, Williams met 12-year-old powerhouse drummer Zac Farro, who introduced her to his guitarist older brother, Josh, and together they would plot a phenomenon. Before Paramore, Williams played in a local funk cover band—she cited her favorite selection, Chaka Khan and Rufus’s “Tell Me Something Good,” as “basically why I sing”—and, to make extra cash for herself and her mom, she cut some country demos in Nashville. But it was camaraderie she craved. “I wanted to be part of a family,” she once said. In a rock band she found one. Paramore’s vision of misfit pop-rock brought the catharsis of clarity to William’s discontent, in every tidal riff and manicured gang vocal, in the brick-heavy drumming and each soaring, structured woah-oh-oh.In a rabid international pop-punk scene made for the kids, Paramore were, themselves, children: Williams was only 16 when the band released its 2005 debut; Zac Farro, 15, was a ninth-grade dropout. As Paramore legend goes, Atlantic originally hoped to sign Williams in 2003 to mold her into an Avril-style pop star, and her parents didn’t want her to pass up the opportunity. “Explain to me this conspiracy against me,” she sang out, describing her professional torment with pitch-perfect teen angst, on the first tune she wrote with her to-be Paramore bandmates, who she convinced Atlantic to keep along for the ride. On the strength of Williams’ demo CD, the Atlantic A&Rs came to Franklin to check out the band in the bassist’s parents’ living room—majors shipping out to the suburbs to scout emo savants was not uncommon in the wake of Dashboard, My Chem, Taking Back Sunday, et al—and they were allegedly amazed: “Okay, yeah, Paramore, sounds good!” Williams’ own chronicle of how she defiantly rejected a solo career is decidedly more emo: “There was a heated conversation with a team of people [at Atlantic] in which I said I would be just as happy to play these songs in Taylor’s basement for the rest of my life. It was a very empowered moment. My voice was shaking. I was crying.” She changed music.",Rock,8.8
590,"This new 50-song box set traces parallel paths through the futurist rockers’ rise, fall, and eventual reunion. Devo’s philosophy of de-evolution feels prophetic: Society does seem to be slipping backward. So the time is ripe for 50 Years of De-Evolution 1973-2023, an anthology of the Akron art rockers who made their name pairing wiry proto-punk grooves with sly social critique. Fitting their embrace of irony—they opened 1979’s Duty Now for the Future with a regal instrumental called “Devo Corporate Anthem,” after all—the career-spanning compilation is available in a variety of incarnations, the splashiest of which is a 4xLP box set containing a variety of collectible tchotchkes.The air fresheners, lithographs, and Brain Dead capsule collections add to the distinctly festive air surrounding 50 Years of De-Evolution. Unlike the previous double-disc set Pioneers Who Got Scalped: The Anthology, this compilation isn’t a chronological document, but a celebration of a complex, sometimes baffling body of work. Too long to count as a greatest-hits compilation, too reliant on the band’s standards to be of considerable interest to hardcore fans—all the rarities have been in circulation for a while—50 Years of De-Evolution nevertheless portrays an act that simultaneously inhabited its times and pointed the way to the future.Few bands had as electrifying or confounding a first act as Devo. They were art school students who were radicalized by the May 4, 1970 shooting of student protesters at Kent State University, where core members Gerald Casale and Mark Mothersbaugh were witnesses to the massacre. Devo used the idea of de-evolution to convey their outrage at the country’s swing to the political right. Casale and Mothersbaugh and their respective brothers, both named Bob, distilled their grimy mix of fantastical futurism and eroding industrial dreams in The Truth About De-Evolution, a 1976 short film where they appeared in a variety of guises. One of the roles they played was a robotic rock band who sang “Jocko Homo”—the source of the group’s famous call-and-response chant, “Are we not men?” “We are Devo!”—and “Secret Agent Man,” a perverted cover of the 1966 hit by Johnny Rivers. They were kinetic transmissions from an alternate universe.The Truth About De-Evolution won first prize at the 1977 Ann Arbor Film Festival, but the band soon gained enough momentum to eclipse its filmmaking ambitions. Locking in their lineup with drummer Alan Myers, Devo knocked out a handful of terse, nervy singles that refined rock’n’roll to its brutalist essence, which left plenty of space for smart-ass sci-fi musing. Early on, Devo used cover songs to illustrate the distance between themselves and other rock bands: Where their peers reveled in abandon and catharsis, they specialized in rhythms so tightly wound, they seemed mechanical. This difference was especially evident in their version of “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction,” which stripped the Rolling Stones anthem of Keith Richards’ signature Fuzz-Tone riff and ramped up tension with guitars that scratched to a clockwork beat.",Rock,7.4
591,"After two decades of tinkering, the art-rocker’s first album since 2002 arrives in an array of different mixes. Yet the songs are refreshingly uncomplicated, reconnecting with Gabriel’s pop instincts. If you are someone who struggles with perfectionist tendencies, then you can maybe understand how Peter Gabriel is feeling right now. He has been working on an album called i/o for more than 20 years—and teasing it in the press for even longer—and, as of today, it is finally available to hear in full. But before we listen, we must decide which version of the 12-song album we want to play: the “Bright-Side” or the “Dark-Side” mix, each containing the same tracks in the same order, but featuring small adjustments. And if you check out both and enjoy them well enough, but decide that neither is quite right, then you can opt for the “In-Side” mix, available separately and on the three-disc deluxe edition.It’s a funny way to place listeners in the shoes of the artist, asking you to consider the tiny tweaks that build a song’s atmosphere and identity. Listening to i/o, you might find yourself asking: Is the trumpet in “Live and Let Live” a crucial component to its climax or a subtle texture in the background? Do the guitars in “Road to Joy” need to blast from the mix or ride alongside the bass groove? You may become frustrated. And Gabriel is right there with you. There he is on the cover—“one of life’s ummer and ahhers,” as his Genesis bandmate Phil Collins once put it—with his head in his hands, fading into a grim, colorless mass.To even reach this point, the 73-year-old artist had to take some baby steps. First was releasing a new song on each full moon of 2023: a recurring, self-imposed deadline that drip-fed the album steadily to his ever-patient audience. He also booked himself a world tour, where he performed nearly every song from the as-yet-unreleased record each night. Delivered between long monologues about the state of the modern world and the potential benefits of artificial intelligence—and, of course, in between the select hits from his back catalog—Gabriel asked fans to confront this work-in-progress material as a living, breathing art project before encountering it a long-awaited entry in his discography.Beyond the fact that it actually exists, one of the big surprises of i/o is how uncomplicated it is. His last batch of original songs, 2002’s Up, was dense and depressive, and his orchestral diversions—2010’s covers album Scratch My Back and 2011’s reimagining-the-classics set New Blood—transformed their source material into the kinds of melodramatic slow-burns you hear in trailers for big-budget action films. But i/o reconnects with Gabriel’s pop instincts. For the first time in a long time, he is singing big choruses, writing in simple verse about human nature, and trying to uplift. From the sparse balladry of “So Much” to the horn-accompanied bounce of “Olive Tree,” the music reflects little of its arduous recording process. It sounds natural, intuitive.",Rock,7.4
592,"N/A Spencer Zahn has freely lent his talents since relocating to New York in the mid 2000s, touring with artists like Empress Of and Kimbra and contributing to studio albums over a wide sweep of genres. As a devout student of ECM, he’s equally comfortable straddling the rigorous austerity of classical music and the liberatory ethos of spiritual jazz. On last year’s Pigments, a partnership with R&B superstar Dawn Richard, his lush arrangements set the stage for a sprawling drama with Richard as the leading lady. Now Zahn is pulling back the curtain, training the spotlight on himself as he indulges in the music that fascinates him most.Statues is a double LP, and for each Zahn dials into a different mode. On Statues I, he’s at his most somber and sedate, playing unaccompanied at an upright piano and listening to a selection of his favorite recordings while improvising alongside them. “Lawns” gives the game away most readily; it’s a skeletal interpretation of a classic by the late free jazz legend Carla Bley, borrowing the central melody but slowing the tempo. Zahn loops the phrase like a prayer, as if trying to communicate with Bley’s very spirit. The remaining pieces are originals, but use repetition to similarly lofty effects, as on “Snow Fields”; he taps out a leisurely refrain, turning the dial down to a glacial pace and conjuring the beauty of a still winter day. Some tracks can rely too heavily on these repeated passages, like “Two Cranes” or “Never Seen,” which is rescued by an extended improvisation in the midsection.The most fascinating parts of Statues I are the moments where Zahn’s expressiveness shines through. His play is lively on “Lullaby for My Dog” and the recording betrays his emotion. His fingers strike the keys, coming down with an audible thud. His seat creaks as he swings from side to side, inviting us to imagine the space he occupies. On the lithe “Sway,” notes hang in the air, reverberating around the room. When the tones drop out, the sounds of Zahn’s shifting frame become perceptible. He’s vulnerable and exposed.Statues II brings him away from live performance and into the studio. Here he’s iterating on the luxurious production of Pigments, working vignettes from his Yamaha CP-70 electric keyboard into tape loops and sharing them with friends who expanded upon them and gave them to Zahn to reassemble. Opener “Changes in Three Parts,” is an immediate departure from the delicate solo piano of the previous LP, with swirls of horn and piano dancing around one another. A drum pattern creeps in near the end, but it’s not really keeping time; it’s moving with the same fluidity as Zahn’s improvisations.Even where the composition remains sparse, the music on Statues II feels fully realized thanks to its additional texture. On “Morning,” twinkling tones ring out from Zahn’s keys as pitched percussion dances along like stones skipping across water. Tunings and tempos are carefully tweaked, transforming disparate fragments into something alive and dynamic. “High Touch” ascends to free-floating reverie with a soaring trumpet solo from Spencer Ludwig, channeling the specter of Jon Hassell. Outro “Shadow Setup” is the most varied in its intricate layering, its chorus of synth washes and horn riffs coalescing into a dramatic crescendo. Zahn’s piano remains the fundamental framework throughout, but now each piece is properly refined with structure the acoustic numbers were lacking.Statues I may feel slight in comparison to the ornate beauty of Statues II, but it’s the rehearsal before the performance, training your ear for Zahn’s compositional ideas. Statues II builds upon that foundation, imbuing the emotional core of the music with movement and vibrancy. Zahn shows restraint, then lets loose—and it’s a joy to watch him build up to that confident climax.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

593,"On its charmingly homespun debut, the Montreal band plays slap-happy rock music that’s more about feeling the spirit than stressing over perfection. Since the early 1990s, the small town of Sackville, New Brunswick has been a hub of lo-fi, home-recorded indie rock. It was here that Julie Doiron launched the DIY label Sappy Records, spotlighting members of her band Eric’s Trip and their surrounding community before expanding into the annual SappyFest music festival. Sackville is also where Feeling Figures’ co-vocalists Zakary Slax and Kay Moon first crossed paths. For several years, they self-released songs on cassette under the name Dead Beat Poet Society, and the debut album from their new moniker has a charming homespun sensibility that sounds out of time.The Olympia, Washington-based indie-rock institution K Records is a fitting home for Feeling Figures. Upon moving to Montreal, Slax met drummer Thomas Molander in a French language class and recruited bassist Joe Chamandy (Theee Retail Simps, Celluloid Lunch Records) to firm up the rhythm section. After scrapping the album’s initial sessions, Feeling Figures decamped to their rehearsal space and recorded Migration Magic live in one go. Revisiting older tunes from their Dead Beat Poet Society days and tossing in two covers, the group pulled together a slap-happy album that’s more about feeling the spirit than stressing over perfection.The heavier songs written and sung by Slax sound strikingly different from the tender twee-pop tunes where Moon takes the lead. “Seek and Hide” slows down Feeling Figures’ feverish pace with clicking rim shots, before Moon’s solo acoustic number “You Were Young” strips things back even further. “I Should Tell You” foregoes guitars altogether, as Moon echoes the song’s winsome melodies on piano. When she admits “I’ve wasted a life/Trying not to pick up all the pieces/And spill them like Reese’s,” her sheepish delivery stands out like Moe Tucker’s songs for the Velvet Underground.The songs written by Slax blur the line between indie-pop and garage-rock as they tumble toward his wigged-out guitar solos. When he shout-sings in unison with Moon on album closer “Remains,” the doubled power of their voices ups the hair-raising intensity. Slax switches up his delivery on “Sink,” with spoken-word vocals that pick up in the choruses like Ben Hozie from Bodega. On Migration Magic’s catchiest song, “Movement,” the verses sound like a lower-fi take on the Strokes, before gang vocals hit in the choruses. “I mystify myself,” they enunciate, asking an existential question: “Does my struggle speak to anyone else?”The album’s two covers dip into disparate genres while preserving the band’s bedroom-pop intimacy. Harmonium’s “Pour Un Instant” is a rollicking homage that communicates a sense of mutual affection not often present in pastoral French prog. “Don’t Ever Let Me Know” is propelled by drum rolls around the kit, bringing the Bobby Fuller Four’s original into ’90s indie-rock territory. This broad appreciation of musical history proves they know the rules and how to break them. In the final moments of Migration Magic, Slax and Moon pose a simple plea: “If I can just be a stain on your memory/I will be complete.” With every listen, their slacker punk smudge continues to grow.",Rock,7.1
594,"The fingerstyle experimentalist’s new album bends guitar, mouth bow, field recordings, and electronic detritus into vast tapestries of pliant drone. “Recording is something I’m not terribly excited about,” Daniel Bachman admitted in 2017. “Things never come out the way I’d like them to.” The Fredericksburg, Virginia, fingerstyle prodigy had been making records for eight years at that point, beginning when he was just 19. But he’d been touring for even longer, since shortly after having his head “split open” by discovering John Fahey and Jack Rose at the tender age of 16. The music that Bachman plays—folk, ragtime, and blues, much of it very old—is a conversation between past and present, writer and interpreter, performer and audience. It’s a living thing. It’s easy to see how he might feel that sealing it off in the studio was a surefire way to see it die on the vine. But in recent years, Bachman has found a new approach to recording, approaching the studio as an instrument in its own right. Old yarn, new loom: On albums like Axacan, The Morning Star, and Almanac Behind, he wove folk and bluegrass together with bells, field recordings, and staticky scraps of radio into vast tapestries of pliant drone.Bachman continues that method on When the Roses Come Again, though to call its place of origin a “studio” might be a stretch. He recorded the album on his laptop during a week’s worth of improvisations, eight hours a day, in a cabin where he worked as a carpenter’s assistant. He built or modified many of the instruments he used. He fashioned an Appalachian mouth bow, a single-stringed instrument of African origin, and de-fretted a banjo; he also availed himself of sound-making apps on his phone. Yet the overall feel is less turbulent than on the sprawling Axacan or the apocalyptic Almanac Behind. The focus has returned to the sounds of his guitar and banjo, which weave, snakelike, through shimmering fields of harmonium and electronic squeal.Like all of Bachman’s work, When the Roses Come Again is all instrumental. In contrast to the dazzling pickwork of his early albums, much of the playing is tentative and muted, warily teasing out halting melodies from the greater tangle. There are no real songs to speak of—just scenes, which flow together as seamlessly as fields glimpsed from the window of a moving train. The album is clearly meant to be experienced as a single piece of music, and the pacing is immaculate. Introductory passages of pentatonic riffs and electronic pedal tones give way to gravelly mouth bowing and cascading sheets of feedback; noisy peaks ease off into spidery banjo and guitar. The recording’s fidelity sounds like a tape that’s been rescued from a truck at the bottom of a lake; the mix of drone and noise suggests a lineage with Henry Flynt, Tony Conrad, Flying Saucer Attack, and Wolf Eyes. (The mouth bowing, meanwhile, had me thinking about Tuvan throat singing and Attila Csihar’s work with Sunn O))).) Halfway through, the album rises to a feverish climax of squeaking and rattling—could there be a jackhammer in the mix?—that sounds like someone playing banjo along to a beaten-up copy of Metal Machine Music.",Folk,7.9
595,"The Chicago footwork producer dials into a captivating, stripped-back style that sets tightly wound rhythms against ominous open space. Of all the footwork stalwarts to grace the roster of Chicago’s legendary Teklife label, DJ Manny might be the most enigmatic. While his most prominent tracks flip R&B samples and gentle chords into wistful delirium, a glance at his Bandcamp page reveals that he can’t be so easily pinned down. Booming riffs on regional club styles, house, and acid techno sit comfortably next to dozens of footwork EPs and compilations that run from swaggering, battle-ready cuts to moody patchwork swirls. It’s all released at a pace that implies a maniacal efficiency. Hypnotized, his newest album on Planet Mu, is a skeletal, tensile construction that casts its splintering energy conduits in jagged relief.DJ Manny called 2021’s Signals in My Head an “R&B love type of album,” a blushing, infatuated romp inspired by his relationship with fellow DJ and producer SUCIA!. Hypnotized doesn’t have such an overt theme, asserting its bleak, anxious interiority through stripped-back composition. Manny has never shied away from minimalism—his beats might rattle just one or two drum samples around the traditional syncopated bassline. Hypnotized refines that approach into something approaching outright menace. Tracks linger on gaps and empty spaces, emphasizing silence. “I Can Luv U” opens with the dead ring of MIDI keys, fading into cold, frictionless air, before ramping into an assault of jittery woodblock tones doubled by a buzzing synth lead. “Overnight Flight”’s frosty pad enters and cuts away without warning, weaving through thick, distorted kicks that engulf skittering hi-hats and hurried arpeggiations in their muddy wake. If Signals, flush with feeling and excitement, represented the honeymoon phase, then Hypnotized represents everything after: the chaotic, indifferent highs and lows.In the album’s most intoxicating moments, DJ Manny abandons the standard footwork playbook to explore new permutations of his core sound. “Lost in Da Jungle” is a breezy atmospheric jungle track that wouldn’t feel out of place in an LTJ Bukem set, splattering detuned halogen chords against a curtain of gently chopped breakbeats. This shift in style is played so straight that it’s almost agonizing, inviting listeners to consider the points of contact and divergence between the genres. “Opera,” while more standard in structure, might be even stranger, setting the haunting, messianic wails of an opera diva beside percussion and spiraling melodies that ascend without resolution.The conversation around DJ Manny has long focused on youth, prodigiousness, and extraordinary talent. This is an artist who’s been contributing to the scene since he was in middle school, first as a dancer, then as a producer after he picked up a copy of Fruity Loops at 14. Footwork pioneer DJ Rashad, one of Manny’s mentors, once said that “as far as our crew goes, Manny is the future for us.” Hypnotized proves Rashad’s forecast: This isn’t merely a glimpse of the future, but a toolkit for its assembly.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

596,"The Brooklyn drill stars show they’re the best the scene has to offer on a debut mixtape with some distracting extras. In early 2022, the Brownsville trio 41—rappers Kyle Richh, Jenn Carter, and TaTa, all just a couple years removed from high school—relaunched a Brooklyn drill scene that had been decimated by jail and death. It’s hard to point to one specific breakout moment, but it’s probably their first On the Radar cypher from May 2022, which had a volcanic, anything-could-happen energy not far off from old DJ Clue radio freestyles. No surprise that it’s the most watched episode of the series, beating out viral sessions by the likes of Ice Spice and Drake.Their profile rose in the fall after they released “Notti Bop,” a low, attention-seeking song and dance mocking the death of Harlem rapper Notti Osama, the 14-year-old younger brother of DD Osama. As if it never happened, they then made a sharp pivot to party anthems, infusing the no-holds barred spirit of drill with the breakneck rhythms of Jersey club. Others in New York had tried to do this, but none leaned as far as 41, and new doors opened up to them: They’ve started to play local shows (a rarity for drill stars, given the intensity of police surveillance), and broken through to gatekeepers like Funk Flex and Angie Martinez at a time when corporatized NYC radio has kept its distance from the subgenre.Now they’ve got their first project, 41 World: Not the Album. (For some reason, they decided not to just call it 41 World: The Mixtape). It’s a formal introduction to the crew, complete with all the expected extras—solo tracks, singing, a major name remix of their biggest hit—none of which are necessary, because they sound the best when it’s just the three of them going at full speed. Like on “Run That!,” which gives M.O.P.’s buckwild classic “Ante Up” the club treatment with throbbing drums and gun clicks. It’s a real headbanger: Jenn delivers the hook with the intensity of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, TaTa chants “Go get that nigga” like he’s in a football huddle, and KR screams “Brownsville, we got the motion” like he’s about to combust into flames. Another highlight is “Stomp Stomp,” the trio’s drill spin on “Crank That.” Yeah, I know. Get your eyerolls out of the way now. But from KR’s rowdy opening bars (“In the party I’m not havin’ fun/Like, thinkin’ ’bout usin’ my gun”) they breathe new life into what could have easily been nothing but nostalgia bait.",Rap,6.5
597,"A new reissue of the Roxy Music frontman’s 1994 album fleshes out its opulent funk with a wealth of unreleased material that pulls back the curtain on his insular creative process. When Bryan Ferry lamented, in 1973’s “Mother of Pearl,” “If you’re looking for love in a looking glass world/It’s pretty hard to find,” he had not reckoned with how easy the looking would become. Twenty years later, on the cusp of his fifties, the former Roxy Music singer-songwriter released the most insular solo album of his career. He had already exhausted the patience of some reviewers. “Ferry seems increasingly like Narcissus, enraptured by his own reflection in the pond—and the bottomless depth below,” Rolling Stone’s Anthony DeCurtis hissed about 1987’s Bête Noire.Yet to gaze so intently at oneself bespeaks not just narcissism but also confidence. Ferry had spectacular hair and he knew it. Teased and moistened by expert hands, Mamouna is the album equivalent of Ferry’s bangs: singular, an occasion for envy and amusement, an essential component of his mythos—and often genuinely beautiful. This three-disc set includes that 1994 album; previously unreleased tracks Ferry had recorded for a project called Horoscope; and demos, some of which date back to 1989. “The demos I do tend to become the masters,” he explained to Creem in 1993. “They’re on the same tape, and more foliage just grows around them.” Of course the package is excessive—do Ferry fans expect minimalism? He’s a foliage guy.Horoscope was meant to be Ferry’s new album. He fucked up: He should’ve known not to release the title before the product. That old devil, writer’s block, paralyzed him; the lyrics, which he’d spent years paring down to pointillist suggestion, were a problem. He had no manager and no producer. For a hoarder confronted by the possibilities of 56-track recording, it must’ve been like Narcissus walking into a funhouse. Flailing, he resorted to a tested strategy: He and new producer Robin Trower, of Procol Harum, knocked out a covers album called Taxi, notable for a shivery essential version of “Will You Love Me Tomorrow?” and an “All Tomorrow’s Parties” whose lounge-pop vibes might’ve birthed Air. Rejuvenated, he returned to his original material, now called Mamouna, Arabic for good luck, of which he’d been in short supply.There is nothing remotely Arabic or Middle Eastern about Mamouna; there is nothing remotely human about Bryan Ferry, this Holy Spirit of Divine Melancholy. But hiring Trower made an important difference. Mamouna has a crispness. The guitars and keyboards don’t flicker and dissolve, as on Boys and Girls, or clang and chime, as on Bête Noire—Trower centers them in the mix. Most importantly, Ferry doesn’t peek from behind the beats like he had done to coquettish effect since 1982: He’s upfront and declarative, taking advantage of his upper register before rust enfeebled it. Consonants matter again. “I wanna be just everything/More than you need/I wanna hear you call’/Nothin’ but me,” he declares on opener “Don’t Want to Know” over David Williams’ Chic-indebted riffing, and he doesn’t let up.",Electronic,8.0
598,"On her full-length debut, the Tamil Swiss singer and rapper presents a lively and ambitious blend of R&B, rap, and Tamil folk. Like so many in the South Asian diaspora, 37-year-old Tamil Swiss singer and rapper Priya Ragu is hungry for art that speaks to the complexity of our experiences. She has said that there’s no single theme to her new album, Santhosam, which touches on topics as varied as combating familial pressure, craving a vacation, and contesting police brutality. But throughout her career, her work has centered around her desire to express her perspective as the child of Sri Lankan refugees and to reach other South Asian listeners in the process. She called her debut mixtape damnshestamil. She wears saris with T-shirts in performances, sings in her mother tongue, and dedicates a song on the new album to her grandmother (a common gesture among South Asian diasporic artists). In her music, she pulls equally from R&B, rap, and Tamil folk, creating a blend she calls “Ragu-wavy.”“Ragu-wavy” pairs the boisterous production of Santigold and fellow Tamil diasporic artist M.I.A. with the adroit vocal stylings of Snoh Aalegra or Sade. Ragu is also a student of the Tamil music she grew up hearing at home: She specifically draws from kuthu, a fast-paced, drum-forward type of folk music found in Kollywood (Tamil-language cinema) films and sampled by M.I.A. The bombastic arrangements of tracks like “Escape” and “Adalam Va!” convey the self-determined optimism suggested by the title Santhosam (Happiness), whether Ragu is singing about a burgeoning relationship or urging us to hold onto our faith. She sounds confident and dexterous when she raps in Tamil, as in the chorus of audacious self-love anthem “Power,” where she hopscotches defiantly over cascading violin and synth.Album closer “Mani Osai,” which Ragu wrote with her father and brother, makes her mastery of South Asian musical traditions especially clear. Gentle tabla and humming synth establish a slow-moving ambient river while violin swells, golden bansuri notes, and layered vocals that sound right out of an A. R. Rahman composition flutter like confetti. Ragu sings patiently and warmly in Tamil, delivering her most affecting vocal performance on the record.As she builds her vision for South Asian diasporic pop, Ragu looks to an earlier generation of Black American artists for inspiration. She cites Lauryn Hill, Stevie Wonder, and Brandy as influences and draws on elements of R&B and rap. The most political track on the album, “Black Goose,” was written amid the 2020 Black Lives Matter movement to honor George Floyd’s life. There’s a long history of Asian musicians allying themselves in solidarity with Black artists; Ragu specifically identifies a connection between the Black Lives Matter movement and her family’s history surviving the genocide of Tamils in Sri Lanka. But by invoking anti-Black oppression in the first person—“Officer don’t shoot, I got so much shit to do,” she sings in the chorus—she winds up conflating racialized experiences in a way that feels vague and appropriative rather than supportive.",Pop,7.0
599,"After retiring the Lingua Ignota moniker, the transgressive diva takes a scholarly deep dive into the ecstatic and strangely melodious world of traditional Christian hymns and original devotionals. The voice of Kristin Hayter is a conduit for extreme pain. Her music as Lingua Ignota channeled the violence and abuse that men inflicted on her, which she righteously directed back at them with incantatory singing, transcendent screams, and immaculate sound design. This mixture of performance art and composition recalls Diamanda Galás, whose grief-stricken music is similarly earnest, operatic, and immersed in electronics. Late last year, when Hayter announced that she was retiring the Lingua Ignota moniker because it was “excruciating to perform,” the decision echoed how Galás finds relief from her elegies under the guise of a bluesy cabaret act. Hayter takes a spiritually similar tact on her new album, Saved!, which courses with both religious awe and discomfort. It somehow only pulls us deeper into Hayter’s disturbing vision.Ordained online as an actual minister, Reverend Kristin Michael Hayter blends traditional Christian songs and original devotionals, incorporating gospel, blues, and bluegrass into a washed-out image of American folk custom. She makes her versions sound like aged field recordings without detracting from their genuine emotion—a feat of shapeshifting and supple technological manipulation. With producer Seth Manchester, she recorded these songs on a 4-track and warped the tapes by feeding them through broken cassette players, mangling them further by hand. The damaged finished product evokes found-footage horror films, enveloping us in a world that seems incidental but is actually aestheticized: artifice disfigured to resemble reality.Hayter grew up Catholic, and she’s made music about a variety of Christian denominations. Her excellent 2021 record, Sinner Get Ready, used a delicate palette to explore faiths native to Pennsylvania’s backcountry, including the Mennonites and Amish. Saved! centers on the Pentecostal-Holiness Movement, a Protestant sect that encourages charismatic activities—among them glossolalia, or speaking in tongues. Hayter’s settings journey into spare, tuneful terrain. She strips her toolkit down to an acoustic guitar, minimal percussion, and a piano hung with chains and bells, a treatment that draws attention to buzzing wire more than struck keys. The altered instrument plunks out a harsh, ominous sense of rhythmic consistency during an otherwise consonant 46 minutes.Hayter seems to play characters—or, as she might describe it, people manifest in her performances. She indeed speaks in tongues, utterances that produce both discordant interludes and a roiling underlay to otherwise tuneful music. And Christianity’s musical heritage allows the past to speak through her. The credits neglect to acknowledge the specific songwriters and standards she imitates, such as 1920s blues legend Blind Willie Johnson on “I Know His Blood Can Make Me Whole” and preacher Robert Lowry on “Nothing But the Blood.” It’s a curious decision, but also a provocative one that feels couched in a lineage of 20th century appropriative writers such as Kathy Acker—Hayter studied to be an experimental writer before she began Lingua Ignota. Her murky source material furthers the illusion that we’ve stumbled upon a cobwebbed and haunted talisman, some cursed keepsake of the penitent American soul.",Experimental,7.5
600,"The Chicago musician celebrates idealism on an album of vivid, jubilant art pop that refuses to be pinned down. When Sen Morimoto tried to swallow the sobering realities of pursuing music as a full-time job, he almost quit songwriting entirely. The Chicago multi-instrumentalist was keenly aware that the industry thrives on exploitation—of trauma, identity, and naivete, to start—to sell records. Loath to conform to capitalist models but aware that concessions must be made, Morimoto found himself overwhelmed and undervalued, navigating a confusing balancing act of caring deeply and learning when not to. On his third album, Diagnosis, he abandons that tightrope walk with one big trust fall—into the arms of his collaborators, his ideals, and, ultimately, a more unguarded version of himself.Diagnosis sounds both liberated and stressed—but then, Morimoto’s music has never been reducible to a single sound or mood. Born in Kyoto and raised in Massachusetts, he grew up studying jazz before trying out hip-hop and playing in punk bands. In his solo music, he alternates between crooning and rapping while juggling guitar, saxophone, synths, drum programming, and Wurlitzer, among other instruments. Previously, he dreamed up songs with acid jazz, doo-wop harmonies, and lo-fi beats while scrubbing plates as a dishwasher. Now, after quitting that job to focus on music, Morimoto restructures those impulses into breathable grooves with jazz flourishes and slow songs built around romantic rhythm sections.For a self-proclaimed anti-capitalist like Morimoto, the hardest part of pursuing a music career is accepting the need to play the game. He’s found new ways to rethink his values without sacrificing intent, like starting a podcast to confront “industry bullshit”; after five years of self-releasing on his own label, Sooper Records, he has partnered with City Slang to bring out Diagnosis. He works through his ambivalence on “Diagnosis,” a mutating pop-rap ode to the Catch-22 of participating in a system you’re fighting against. Facing down the businesses and politicians that offer a false choice between money or life, he shouts a warning loud enough to wake someone from a daze: “Don’t let them choose/They won’t think twice.”And when he tries to go with the flow, the doubt sinks in anyway. “When it was real, how did you know?” Morimoto asks in “Pressure on the Pulse,” imposter syndrome biting at his heels. He rifles through trash cans for an established artist’s checklist to success: Which pen did they use? How do they tie lyrics into a bow? Most importantly, what transforms a person who makes art into an artist? In “Surrender,” he manipulates moods to illustrate the battle of head versus heart. Morimoto spits out each word in the phrase, “Please don’t give up now,” while manic keys spiral out of control.

601,"The San Francisco rapper and Dallas producer are still having a good time on their lush and laid-back fifth album together. Larry June’s style couldn’t be more straightforward: Aspirational flex raps and checklisted wellness routines delivered with such serenity, it’s like he’s a walking valium pill. It’s an adaptable approach: Whether he’s gracing his trademark West Coast post-hyphy beats, dreamy disco-pop, or velour sample loops, he rarely sounds out of place. He’s able to flex this versatility with the hyper-malleable Texas producer Cardo, with whom he’s made five projects in the last four years. Unlike June’s work with production duo LNDN DRGS or the Alchemist, which tend to marinate in one sound for an entire project, his team-ups with Cardo boast more song-to-song variety. The Night Shift, their fifth album, maintains that spirit with warm and sultry beats to cruise to.Cardo has produced stadium-ready megahits for Travis Scott and Drake, contemplative ballads for Kendrick Lamar, and frenetic beats for Pi’erre Bourne and Baby Keem, all of which are tied together by an enveloping sense of scale. The best Cardo beats are the epitome of surround sound, landing around you like a dome. On previous collaborations, Cardo gravitated towards the wavy rhythms of hyphy; The Night Shift more or less sticks to that script, with lush, swinging rhythms on tracks like “Chops on the Blade” and “Pop Out.” June’s mellow confidence normally keeps things from getting dull, but his boasts can sometimes go from charmingly basic to eye-rollingly cliche. Take the first verse of “Glasshouse Knockin’,” which sounds like it was penned during one of his many stock portfolio meetings: “My numbers is different, my hoes is brilliant/My snow Sicillian, I’m countin’ a million” he says, a scenario we’ve heard him describe hundreds of times before.Cardo’s hyphy work is smooth—the distorted swing of ”GRGP” inspires Bay Area legend Too $hort and Detroit street rapper Peezy to get loose, and when Cardo pushes June offshore musically, things perk up. Early highlight “Ocean Cuisine” mixes a string sample and tinny hi-hats with a bouncing drum line as June plots to fill his garage with several different kinds of coupes. It’s peppy without knocking June out of his BPM comfort zone, and enough to give guest 2 Chainz room to run off with one of his most memorable features in a minute (“Told him it was chess, not checkers, like an A-cup”). “Love of Money” keeps up this momentum with jazzy saxophone and booming 808s that could soundtrack a night a a 5-star Michelin restaurant. The right beat will make even the most cliche Larry June bars sound first-time fresh.Like his Bay Area forebears $hort and E-40 before him, June has built a legacy on dependable homegrown lifestyle raps. And while The Night Shift doesn’t contain anything too surprising, his music with Cardo remains among the most fluid and fun in his catalog. The pleasure in a body of work like The Night Shift comes from its configurations, the constant tinkering that can unearth new dimensions within a classic formula.",Rap,7.0
602,"Though often plodding and generic, the R&B singer’s third studio album contains vivid flashes of her best songwriting. Here’s a tweet that recently made me laugh: “You think you know your friends then boom you see them posting Mariah the Scientist lyrics on their Instagram story.” It’s a reference to the 26-year-old R&B singer’s famously raw and diaristic lyrics, which, at their worst, tip into the maudlin—the stuff of high-school journals and Tumblr art. Still, when Mariah’s writing does work, as on 2019’s Master and 2021’s Ry Ry World, her poetic vulnerability stuns. “I use my telescope at night, it won’t be for stars/Instead I hope that I can love you from afar,” she sings, resigned to her solitude on Ry Ry World standout “RIP.” Mariah might not have the disaffected tragedy of Summer Walker or the gut-punch neuroses of SZA, but she still knows how to pick apart the remains of a failed relationship with scavenger-like precision.To Be Eaten Alive, Mariah’s third studio album, ditches the well-drawn, sometimes-treacly origin stories of her first two full-lengths. In their place is a collection of disappointingly aimless and often impersonal takes on distant love. Mariah has been in a highly publicized relationship with Young Thug since around 2021, and the strain of maintaining their bond during Thug’s incarceration could, in theory, make for compelling songwriting material, more so than simply being scorned. Instead, she sounds bored and uninspired, too exhausted by her circumstances to jolt herself awake.The beats are often the problem here; Ry Ry World blended everything from melancholy trap and muted boom bap to moody Justin Timberlake and Beach House samples. That inventive approach balanced the pitchiness of Mariah’s voice and her limited vocal range, both of which work in her favor when she’s recalling disastrous fights in a deadpan tone. Unfortunately, when she scream-belts her heart out, those qualities are more like liabilities. Save for a few surprising collaborations, including the out-of-place but refreshing Kaytranada-produced “Out of Luck,” the beats on To Be Eaten Alive are mostly plodding and bland, making the album’s 27-minute runtime feel twice as long as it actually is. dvsn’s Nineteen85, a previous Drake collaborator, helms three of the songs here; his mud-thick BPMs and drums drag Mariah down with them, practically damning the songs before they take off. It’s a shame that any of these tracks could appear as a sleepy “Mariah’s Interlude” on a hypothetical Aubrey Graham album.The listless “40 Days n 40 Nights” and “Good Times” waste flashes of vivid songwriting (“I’ll put a hundred miles on the AMG tonight/And take it anywhere but home,” she sings on the former). Equally sunk are “From a Woman” and “Lovesick,” where Mariah unleashes strained choruses that somehow disappear into the ether; she sounds more like she’s complaining than pleading. When she does find an instrumental with some life behind it, more similar to those on Ry Ry World, she finally sounds awake. The thumping, WondaGurl-produced “Bout Mine” is the Mariah the Scientist sweet spot: a trap-R&B hybrid offset by swaggering, too-cool vocals. It’s also one of the only song titles you’ll remember from the album, even after repeated listens.",Pop,6.3
603,"These are the only known recordings of the legendary improvising guitarist and the celebrated jazz drummer. Though wildly abstract, their playing also feels like a conversation between friends. In 2002, three years before his death, Derek Bailey explained his secret to a life of sustained creative practice. “It’s through other people,” he said. “There are improvisers who like to work regularly over decades with the same people. I’m not one of them.” The simplicity of the English guitarist’s answer belied the depth and intensity of his discipline. Bailey started improvising with other musicians in the early 1950s, and performed with bassist Gavin Bryars and drummer Tony Oxley during the 1960s. But during the first half of the next decade, he spent much of his time playing alone. The move was intentional: He believed that with a foundation in solo improvisation, he could play with anyone. During this exploratory phase, he traced the outer limits of his instrument, searching for “a language that would be literally disjointed” and “more open to manipulation.” The goal, as he stated in his 1980 book Improvisation, was “perpetual variation.”He held steadfast to that objective. Drop into any album from his gargantuan catalog and something new comes to light. On 1988’s Cyro, Bailey’s guitar frolics with bells, shakers, and friction drums, highlighting the percussive range of his every pluck and scrape. In 1981’s Views from 6 Windows, Christine Jeffrey’s extended vocal techniques subtly oscillate between textural utterances and something more melodic—a mirror to Bailey’s own traversal of the guitar’s expressive and austere registers. He’d even play along with pirate radio stations, enticed by the speed of jungle tracks; at their best, these exercises reveal the thrill in spontaneity underlining all his works, regardless of tempo. The new release Duo in Concert unveils even more. It contains the only shows pairing Bailey and American drummer Paul Motian: one in Groningen, the Netherlands, and the other in New York City. Recorded in the early 1990s, these performances capture two improvisational titans at the height of their powers, their collaboration a conduit for novel modes of artistic expression.At the beginning of their 35-minute concert in Groningen, the two seem to be feeling out their instruments. Bailey lets chords ring out before darting around with spangled melodies, and Motian taps a cymbal before employing drum rolls that fade into one another. It’d feel like a scrappy soundcheck if they weren’t obviously riffing with each other. Their chemistry is immediate, and it makes sense: When Bailey was in his trio with Bryars and Oxley, they’d listen to the Bill Evans Trio, which counted Motian and bassist Scott LaFaro as members. On a song like “All of You,” Motian’s brushwork provides the backbone for piano and bass to zigzag across the landscape. That happens in this show too, but at the micro level: For about 50 seconds, early on, he offers a similarly quiet and propulsive beat while Bailey matches its pace, stumbles out of it, and then strums chords with charming nonchalance. They’re in complete concentration here, but the music feels like a loping conversation between longtime friends.",Experimental,7.8
604,"Experimental label mappa editions’ elegiac collection of avian electronics is full of deliberately laid textures and out-there approaches to composition. The trees are disappearing, and so are their inhabitants. In the past 20 years, global forest coverage has dropped by roughly 10 percent, and one-third of bird species are expected to go extinct by the end of this century. Jakub Juhás, head of Slovakian label mappa editions, is surely aware of this. Over the years, the label has built a hall of mirrors from environmental recordings and experimental compositions; a look into its catalog reveals haunted cave dives, explorations of rust, and snowed-in a capella. It is a body of work interested in solitude, intimacy, and hushed electronics. Mappa’s latest release, Synthetic Bird Music, compiles 32 electronic and experimental music pieces inextricably bound up with nature. The works range from years old to brand new, but they are joined by a shared interest in organic and electronic synthesis. It is the sound of musicians the world over reckoning with an ongoing climate catastrophe.As early as the 17th century, professional whistlers—siffleurs—worked the vaudeville circuit and ventured into the woods, mocking mockingbirds and playing alongside nightingales. Synthetic Bird Music picks up this torch with a newfound urgency, conjuring birdsong that doesn’t exist and engineering accompaniment for birds that do. It is dominated by slow pieces and brain-bending synth work, with elegiac keyboards echoing the thinning populations they’re meant to emulate. On “La guardian de las ondas radiales 1” (“The Guardian of the Radio Waves”), Makakinho del Amor (aka Tomás Tello) wraps bird calls in a blanket of static and high-pitched keyboards. Hmot’s “Irekle Qoştar” takes a few bits of birdsong and cranks up the distortion until they sound like a transmission from a dying ham radio. Much of the compilation works like this: It is a swan dive into the uncanny valley, sitting somewhere between real and imagined, playful and unsettling.Synthetic Bird Music outlines a world of approaches to birdsong and its accompaniment: Found-sound industrial techno (Native Instrument’s “Vögel Unserer Heimat”), wigged-out Fourth-World ambience (Tomutonttu’s “Harpusta / Tarjous”), avian post-rock (Baldruin’s “Sonderbare Ereignisse am Lake Hillier”), and haunted-house synth workouts (Mike Cooper’s “The Wild Birds of Bluesealand”). The record brings together artists from umpteen scenes—Bratislava and Berkshire, San Francisco and Sydney—but each work feels like part of an unspoken narrative, an atlas stuffed with imagined landscapes. (It helps that the record is arranged chronologically, moving from pre-dawn birdsong to late-night ambience.) Synthetic Bird Music functions as a survey of contemporary electronic-music experimentation, looking across the globe for deliberately laid textures and out-there approaches to composition.",Mappa,7.3
605,"Inspired by the rolling dunes of a Danish national park, the Copenhagen-based musician’s spare, drifting album peeks at unfathomable vastness. Like a fistful of sand tossed to the wind, Ingri Høyland’s new album Ode to Stone sometimes threatens to disappear entirely. There are seldom more than a few tones playing at any given moment; with the exception of her collaborator Ida Urd’s electric bass, the provenance of her sounds is often unclear. Are they synthesizers? Feedback? Aural illusions caught on tape? They flicker like candlelight, tremble like the last leaves left on a barren branch. For long stretches, nothing happens, except for the decay of two or three notes fading to silence. But Ode to Stone is not minimalist, exactly. That term—any “-ism,” in fact—feels too structural, too knowing, for music this prone to drifting.This organic, aleatory quality marks a significant shift from Høyland’s last album, There's a Girl Inside My Brain Who Wants to Die, where the Norwegian-born, Copenhagen-based musician grappled with anguish and vulnerability in stark, shadowy electronic pop. Where that album was deeply personal—the first track was called “Ego, Bitch”—Ode to Stone decenters the human. Working in collaboration with Urd, fellow ambient musician Sofie Birch, and visual artist Lea Dulditte Hestelund, Høyland created the album in response to an open call for work themed around Denmark’s national parks. She chose to focus on Husby Klitplantage, a rolling dune landscape fringed by pine forests on the country’s west coast.Peruse photos of the place while listening to the album, and Ode to Stone’s abstraction snaps into focus. Høyland’s soft, rounded tones mimic the broad sweep of the dunes, the patterns of wind combing across seagrass, the silver of the winter sun on a flat, gray sea. She has spoken of her interest in capturing the “cohesive force” of that coastal wilderness: the interplay of the elements, and the interdependencies that have evolved over eons. To offer a glimpse of deep time in a half hour of music is no easy task, but Ode to Stone does an admirable job, despite its humble, understated materials.“Forced by its very weight” opens the record with held tones and the faintest shimmer of melody; its languid pace and refusal of anything like a payoff feel like an invitation to slow down and clear one’s thoughts. “Memory in hand” dissolves further into the air, a soft explosion of electronic birdsong. Such forms are too indistinct to follow closely; the mind wanders, not unpleasantly. But should you refocus your attention on the music, you might be surprised at how much variety there is. The effect is akin to the way that a seemingly drab patch of beach, under close examination, begins to reveal a microscopic infinity.",Experimental,7.4
606,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit the debut album from a trio that split from the Specials to forge a mischievous and mysterious electro-pop sound haunted by the racist violence entrenched in British history. The Specials were unlikely pop stars. In 1981, the Coventry ska band, fronted by young misfit Terry Hall but led by keyboardist Jerry Dammers, hit No. 1 with “Ghost Town,” a haunted state-of-the-nation address that painted an image of a country beset by economic decay and racist violence. It was a surprising capstone to a three-year period in which they had come to define two-tone, a working-class, multi-racial subculture, and channeled the downcast, nihilistic mood of Thatcherite Britain. “Ghost Town” perfectly captured the Specials’ ethos and aesthetic, laying bare the contempt the British state had for disenfranchised young people while retaining the wit and candor that reflected their humble origins.The Specials were at their critical and commercial peak, yet relationships within the band were rotten. Hall, along with Lynval Golding and Neville Staple, felt constricted and underappreciated by Dammers, despite the songwriter’s messages of unity and social justice. “Equality and democracy were what we preached. That’s how it was when we started, but it didn’t last,” said Golding at the time. “When we started making $2,000 a night instead of $200, we weren’t equal anymore; we were working for Jerry Dammers.”At the height of their popularity, Golding, Hall, and Staple walked away and started a band where they had everything they claimed Dammers had withheld from them: total creative freedom. Fun Boy Three drew from the same well as the Specials, combining elements of punk with the Jamaican styles that were rattling sound systems across the country. But they gave themselves the liberty to be as wild, weird, and flexible as they wanted. No more suits, no more monochrome, and no more checkered 2 Tone Records stripe on the sleeve. On the cover of their self-titled debut album, the band appeared in front of a giant red spot, dressed down in singlets and t-shirts. The three musicians were already celebrities in the UK, but here they were presented as a band casting off the codes of the two-tone subculture they had helped define.Any sane A&R might have thought twice about betting big on a record like Fun Boy Three, but Chrysalis, the parent company of 2 Tone, rightly decided that the trio was, as Hall put it, “too big to be dropped.” Regardless, any concerns around commercial appeal were moot: The band didn’t demo their songs, so there was nothing for Chrysalis to object to. Working with Specials producer Dave Jordan, the band commuted between Coventry and London every day, improvising songs based on mambo, cha-cha, and reggae rhythms until they hit upon a sound that was spooky and sexy in equal measure, like exotica played by the most maladjusted person you know.",Rock,8.4
607,"The 1978 double-LP live set At Budokan gets a remixed, remastered release of its source recordings, becoming the next maligned Dylan album ripe for critical revision. Given enough time, every one of Bob Dylan’s transgressions in taste is bound for reappraisal. Self Portrait, the double LP that Greil Marcus infamously dismissed upon its release with “What is this shit?,” had its reputation restored through The Bootleg Series, Vol. 10: Another Self Portrait (1969-1971) Dylan’s misunderstood Christian phase sounded fiery and invigorating on The Bootleg Series, Vol. 13: Trouble No More 1979-1981. It would seem at least possible that The Complete Budokan 1978 could perform a similar feat, challenging conventional notions about a Dylan album that critic Dave Marsh claimed was “his worst record by such a wide margin it’s hard to fathom it.” The 1978 double-LP live set At Budokan, one of the beloved artist’s least beloved releases, is the next maligned Dylan album ripe for critical revision thanks to this new 4xCD box containing all of the source recordings for the original LP.The Complete Budokan 1978 comprises two concerts, held February 28 and March 1 in Tokyo, at the beginning of the tour Dylan launched in 1978 with the express intent of raking in badly needed cash. Fresh off a divorce and tapped out from making Renaldo and Clara—his rambling four-hour half-fiction, half-documentary film about his touring extravaganza Rolling Thunder Revue—Dylan turned to Jerry Weintraub, the manager who’d greased the wheels for Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra’s transitions into stadium-conquering touring juggernauts in the 1970s.Bassist Rob Stoner, who played on the Rolling Thunder Revue and stayed on through the 1978 world tour, remembered that “Weintraub told Bob, ‘If you want to take it to the bank, you gotta do one of these slick, money-making tours. Just go out for a year, bust your ass, then you can go back to doing whatever you want.” Dylan heeded his manager’s advice. He expanded a basic band retained from Rolling Thunder with a trio of backing vocalists and saxophonist/flutist Steve Douglas, dressing the entire ensemble in matching stage outfits. When he received word that the Japanese promoter insisted he haul out his greatest hits for the tour’s opening stretch at Budokan, Dylan responded by reworking the tunes to showcase the full range of his band’s skills.Aware of the shifting tides of the business and the culture, Dylan aimed these rearrangements at an audience that was maturing toward the middle of the road, partially inspired by witnessing a Las Vegas spectacle by Neil Diamond—another Weintraub client—in 1977. “Vegas” became a common buzzword in the reviews that greeted both At Budokan and the tour once it arrived Stateside later in 1978, an intended pejorative surely stoked by the spectacles staged by Weintraub. Time may have softened those Vegas associations, yet a listen to The Complete Budokan 1978 shows they’re warranted. A galloping soft-rock instrumental rendition of “A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall”—a hoedown performed as a show tune—sets a suitably loungey tone, one sustained by the snazzy flourishes scattered throughout the concerts. “It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding)” punctuates each verse with stabs of horns; the blues of “Maggie’s Farm” is reduced to a glitzy stomp; “I Shall Be Released” gets consumed by swaths of saxophones. Hints of modern radio drift into the arrangements: The tropical gale blowing through “Shelter From the Storm” evokes Jimmy Buffett and the island vibes intensify on the reggae bounce of “Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right.” As telling as the specific arrangements are the straightlaced performances of Dylan and the band: They’re dutifully hitting their marks, playing the songs the same way both evenings.",Rock,6.1
608,"Dolly Parton’s star-powered, overly reverential, 30-song rock album aims straight down the middle. Dolly Parton is a feminist heroine who won’t say the F-word, a queer icon who conservatives can’t quit. She’s declined presidential honors from both sides of the aisle in her efforts to stay apolitical. For more than 50 years, she’s maintained an equal focus on the creative and commercial sides of the industry, developing an unparalleled brand management strategy that’s earned her millions. She extends that ethos to her new 30-song rock album, Rockstar, a dense and star-studded collection that sounds like the millennium’s most expensive karaoke party. Dolly Parton has never been one for minimalism, and who else could bring together Michael McDonald, P!nk, and Debbie Harry alongside Kid Rock and the current iteration of Lynyrd Skynyrd?Parton’s path to Rockstar was a straight shot from her induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2022, an honor she initially declined so as not to “stir up controversy.” Rock and country fans volleyed questions about genre, artistic merit, and supposed imposter syndrome before Parton changed her mind, eventually attending the ceremony and performing “Jolene” with Rob Halford, Pat Benatar, Annie Lennox, and more. Parton has said that the experience compelled her to make a “real” rock record, but on Rockstar, the framework of rock music is relatively narrow, with covers of songs by Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones, Bob Seger, and Peter Frampton. She sings “Let It Be” with the last two living Beatles yelping absent-minded harmonies. Formulaic arrangements keep the arena-size guitars, keys, and drums all turned up to 11. Apart from the occasional piano ballad reprieve, everything frantically signals rock music. The unrelenting emphasis on a single sound obliterates the careful details that made most of the originals so striking to begin with.Parton delivers an abundance of material that vacillates between boilerplate and downright baffling. Her original song “World on Fire” cribs Queen’s signature stomp-claps, which she revisits when she stitches together “We Are the Champions” and “We Will Rock You.” The contested king of rock’n’roll takes the spotlight in another Parton original, the alarming sock-hop fever dream “I Dreamed About Elvis,” which re-hashes the history of “I Will Always Love You” and imagines the singers in a duet that never happened. She dutifully churns through songs like Journey’s “Open Arms” and REO Speedwagon’s “Keep on Loving You.” And sure, fuck it, get Lizzo to toot a flute on “Stairway to Heaven”! The record ends with “Free Bird,” an 11-minute fart of a closing cliché.",Folk,5.2
609,"A new reissue collects the entirety of the 1973 television score for the first time; it’s a lithe, funky counterpart to the wintry, wistful moods of A Charlie Brown Christmas. Vince Guaraldi rarely sang, but when he crooned over an East Bay funk beat on “Little Birdie,” he made a song so irresistible that it eventually inspired someone to turn it into a one-hour loop. The apex of A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving, “Little Birdie” chronicles Snoopy and Woodstock as they attempt to set up a table for Thanksgiving dinner (and get in a fight with a beach chair). Guaraldi responds to their antics, wondering why Woodstock flies upside down and his friend “can’t do nothin’ right” while a muted trumpet interjects laid-back riffs. It’s a carefree and fantastical song that captures the quintessential swing, playfulness, and panache of Guaraldi’s Peanuts scores.Like “Little Birdie,” A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving trades the moody piano of Guaraldi’s most celebrated score, A Charlie Brown Christmas, for exuberant brass and buoyant Clavinet, drawing on the growing funk movement of Northern California in the early 1970s. The soundtrack represents the pinnacle of Guaraldi’s jazz-funk output, but it has never been released in full outside the television special—it could only be found scattered across compilations. A new 50th-anniversary edition presents the entire score for the first time, with remastered tracks and an array of outtakes that highlight the pure joy of Guaraldi’s most boisterous music.To realize these upbeat songs, Guaraldi assembled a brass- and rhythm-heavy ensemble who brought heavy chops and a flair for experimentation. Drummer Mike Clark is a pioneering funk musician who worked with Herbie Hancock; his broken rhythms give the music its sprightliness and sense of cool. Trumpeter and arranger Tom Harrell and trombonist Chuck Bennett make the brass section sound as big as a marching band. Guaraldi stretches his own limits, picking up the guitar—not his primary instrument, by a long shot—and using Clavinet and Fender Rhodes to add quick-stepping flair.Together, the quintet managed a lot with very little. On “Thanksgiving Interlude,” for example, 30 seconds are enough to capture a whole world of mischievous, elastic groove. Guaraldi would often revisit and tweak themes in his Peanuts scores, and with Thanksgiving, he and the quintet take low-key cues and transform them into uproarious reworks. That penchant for reinvention is most prominent on “Linus and Lucy,” the quintessential Peanuts song, which is sped up and filled out with a full brass section, wandering improvisations, and an ecstatic trumpet riff; here, it sounds loud and bright, fit for a holiday bash.This complete version of A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving also provides a revealing glimpse into Guaraldi’s methods. The back half of the record is full of alternate takes, bonus mixes, and reprises that show how the musicians put the building blocks together. Across the seven versions of “Thanksgiving Interlude,” for example, the same beat makes up the backbone, but it’s a little slower here, or with a little more cymbal there. In one take of “Thanksgiving Theme,” Guaraldi gets upset that he “keeps blowing” it and bangs out the melody on piano like a Beethoven étude. Guaraldi’s Peanuts scores are beloved in part for their unflappable cool; the clip offers an endearing behind-the-scenes glimpse at the composer breaking character (and channeling Schroeder while he does).And while Guaraldi’s Peanuts music might be remembered for its wintry melancholy—“Linus and Lucy” aside, of course—A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving reminds us of the full breadth of his scores. Much of Peanuts’ lasting impact boils down to the expansiveness of Charles M. Schulz’s vision for his characters. Neither the comic strips nor the TV specials ever stuck to just one mood: They jumped from madcap moments to pensive ones, offering an unusually grown-up take on the contradictory, mercurial rush of feelings that defines childhood. The genius of Guaraldi’s scores was the way he mapped the many emotions that erupted in a Peanuts comic strip, and on Thanksgiving, he shows them all.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

610,"On this triumphant live album, the Asheville songwriter transforms his dreamlike narratives into something joyous, collective, and free. When MJ Lenderman performs with his backing band, the musicians barely fit on stage. At one point, the Wind ballooned to eight members because the self-professedly “conflict avoidant” frontman couldn’t bear to kick anybody out. Standing with his electric guitar, behind the pedal steel and the occasional keyboard, Lenderman leads from within his band, a fitting stance for a musician who quit basketball because he couldn’t muster a competitive attitude. As a live ensemble—now generally pared back to a five-piece—MJ Lenderman and the Wind continuously rework the Asheville songwriter’s extensive back catalog, adding a vibrancy to his earlier home recordings that paints them as natural B-sides to his exuberant studio debut, 2022’s Boat Songs. On And the Wind (Live and Loose!), a live album composed of recordings from two shows during summer 2023, Lenderman and his band elevate his dreamlike narratives into something joyous, collective, and free.“The less people hear me talk, the more they can project on me or think I’m a smart guy,” Lenderman said in an interview earlier this year. True to form, the frontman hardly utters a word between songs across the album. When he does speak up, during the minimalist groove that leads into “You Are Every Girl to Me,” it’s only to credit his collaborators—Wednesday bandmate Xandy Chelmis on the pedal steel, Ethan Baechtold on bass, Colin Miller on drums, Jon Samuels (also of Philadelphia bands Friendship and 2nd Grade) on lead guitar, and a special appearance from Lenderman’s girlfriend and Wednesday lead singer Karly Hartzman as a third guitarist and backing vocalist. The band’s chemistry is obvious throughout the record: Chelmis’ pedal steel melts almost imperceptibly into the empty spaces on “Toontown,” lending an extra sigh to Hartzman and Lenderman’s harmony of rodeo clowns. There, as with other Boat Songs cuts like “Under Control,” the band approaches the song as a marathon, not a sprint, Samuels’ riffs carving new paths into familiar rhythms.Low-Key Indie Rocker MJ Lenderman Wants to Tell a Bigger StoryMany of the songs from 2021’s Ghost of Your Guitar Solo were written around the same time as those on Boat Songs; with a full band behind them, they feel of a piece. Take “Catholic Priest,” a winsome ode to the perceived simplicity of piety and the naivete of youth: In its original form, Lenderman’s voice wavers uneasily, occasionally inaudible and cracking on the high notes, while a frail guitar moves through the song’s rhythms. But live, Lenderman sings with the confidence built from years spent on the road, while Chelmis’s pedal steel breathes new energy into the melodies once lazily plucked by an electric guitar. The same goes for an homage to Jack Nicholson’s courtside Lakers seats, “Live Jack,” whose jokes land even harder when they’re punctuated by dueling guitar solos. “Dan Marino,” the shakily recorded Boat Songs track that might be Lenderman’s most compact piece of poetry, sounds like peak time at the honky tonk from the minute the opening guitars come crashing in. Live and Loose! is a document of friendship, the experience of watching the stories Lenderman wrote in isolation become bigger than their creator.",Rock,8.0
611,"The acclaimed South African pianist meets Los Angeles’ ambient-jazz ringleader for a session that shuttles between atmospheric studio experiments and gorgeously unadorned solo takes. Pianist-singer Thandi Ntuli is not the only South African artist reinventing a modern music that some critics want to keep locked in a box called “jazz.” The sound of contemporary South Africa is a global beacon for potential musical futures precisely because so many artists entrenched in the country’s great improvised tradition, with its beautiful Xhosa and Zulu melodies, keep pushing beyond the accepted meaning of that four-letter word.Ntuli, a 36-year-old emissary of a Johannesburg scene gone global, is a standard-bearer for experiments at jazz’s margins. A classical piano prodigy who turned down a Berklee scholarship to study at University of Cape Town, she has collaborated with house producers and joined London saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings’ Ancestors group for a spell. Ntuli’s previous studio albums as leader—The Offering (2014), Exiled (2018), and Blk Elijah & the Children of Meroë (2022)—exhibited visionary scope: piles of instruments and musicians, arrangements that took advantage of their broad tonal and harmonic ranges, and compositions that veered between pop standards, spiritual thought bubbles, and theatrical narratives, plus a voice and musical leadership to carry them all.Rainbow Revisited edits down such big-budget ambitions. It is primarily a solo piano-and-voice session, recorded one Venice Beach afternoon with percussionist/vibes’n’chimes orchestrater Carlos Niño lightly guiding and participating, at times bringing minor overdubs and post-production into the mix. The music is spare, laser focused on those incandescent gospel melodies that feel like a Mzansi jazz birthright, and on ways to minimally ornament them for a broader, internationalist (Anthem and otherwise) audience.Such embellishment doesn’t obscure Ntuli’s expansiveness. It shows her power in a different light—in this case, bathed in the Golden State’s sunrises and sunsets. Ntuli must have been all in, because she named new original tracks after both. The opening “Sunrise (in California)” is a crisp take for piano and voice, abstracting those gorgeous melodies into cubes; later “Sunset (in California)” focuses on folky, melancholy vocal improvisations that draw a direct line between Ntuli’s approach and that of her onetime employer, the great singer Thandiswa “King Tha” Mazwai. On the other side of the spectrum, there are studio experiments whose titles nod to their construction: “Breath and Synth” and “Voice and Tongo.” These airy, atonal rhythm miniatures, straight out of the Carlos Niño & Friends almanac, allow for playful exhalation. In all this newfound space, Ntuli seems unencumbered, free from the constraints often imposed by jazz’s institutional trappings.Yet despite the very different context in which she’s presented on Rainbow Revisited, this Thandi Ntuli is no different than the South African jazz star in the making. Experimenting using traditional tools is at the core of her practice. The title track is a testament to such a strategy. It’s an emotional strip-down of “Rainbow (Skit),” from the sprawling Exiled, rethinking electric bassist Benjamin Jephta’s dexterous runs, along with her own synths, drum-machine programming, and, especially, lyrical literalism. The revisit is a slowed-down acoustic-piano reading that foregrounds the song’s core melody, modally improvising on its chords, akin to Abdullah Ibrahim’s forceful solo-piano turns. Here, the vocal is almost completely wordless, save for a yearning, twisting expression of the titular refraction (the “rainbow” being South Africa’s national post-Apartheid metaphor).",Jazz,7.8
612,"The smoldering collaborative album between the experimental singer-producer and ambient duo casts overwhelming emotions into stark relief. Grisaille, which translates from French as “greyness,” emerged centuries ago as artists grew frustrated by the lack of depth in their paintings. Starting with a light base, they would layer shadow and highlights using a monochromatic palette, building dimension so their canvas looked sculptural, as if chiseled from marble slabs. The austere technique serves as a guide to Rainy Miller and Space Afrika’s new collaborative project A Grisaille Wedding, a smoldering, overcast electronic album that casts overwhelming emotions into stark relief.Miller and Space Afrika shape each composition around a single concept, slowly adding elements to fill the surrounding space. The songs, a blend of gossamer ambient pop and thunderous hip-hop, wrench at themselves, tugging between softer and heavier sounds. The bleary-eyed “00-down / Murmansk 12” employs the bleak winter boom of 2010s Chicago drill to tamp down a reversed melody line; “Maybe It’s Time to Lay Down the Arms” threads candlelit samples through a rickety trip-hop beat that constantly threatens to fall apart. “The Graves of Charleroi” would be a delicate, meandering folk tune if not for its crashing strings and reverberant vocal loops, crushing the air out of the guitars and inducing a sense of claustrophobia.The vocals work more as texture than narrative advancement, but occasional glimpses suffuse the album with yearning. On “Sweet (I’m Free),” guest RezNiro proclaims that “life is absurd,” peeking out from the maelstrom of overdriven drones and feedback stabs; Iceboy Violet’s distorted, double-time flow is another spinning gear propelling the track to its explosive conclusion. The album holds space for both heaviness and hope: When Miller repeats “They told me” in the middle of “Maybe It’s Time to Lay Down the Arms,” he sounds flat and dissociative, as if parsing a truth that his brain won’t process.The album’s most poignant song, “Let It Die,” moves from hushed beauty to total obliteration over the course of its six minutes. The sustained keyboards, slightly frayed at the edges, slowly accumulate; it’s hard to catch everything Miller sings, but even through the processing effects’ alien haze, it’s impossible to miss the ratcheting passion in his delivery. The reverb begins to yawn, swallowing everything, and noise serrates all the synths until the track peaks in an enormous, blistering swirl. It’s an IMAX screen of emotion, overwhelming and cathartic. As it winds down, you’re left drained—not hollow or empty, but cleared, ready for what’s next.",Experimental,7.7
613,"The rapper and now flautist’s debut solo album is an 87-minute devotional to new age, ambient jazz, and spiritual discovery. It’s beautiful, demanding, and among the most fascinating artistic left turns in recent memory. André 3000 was never a solitary genius. Not when he put on the pith helmet and shoulder pads. Not when he kicked off a song called “Int’l Players Anthem” with an ode to fidelity and true love. Not even when he put a dozen versions of himself on stage in the video for “Hey Ya!,” an all-time classic song that will be played at weddings until the heat death of the universe, and on which he played nearly every instrument. Even when he sounded like he was rapping from outer space, his Southern accent dragged him back down to Earth, back to his roots, back to Atlanta, and more specifically, back to his friends and family. “It gives you an opportunity and support system to be as free as you can be,” he recently told NPR, reflecting on where he came from and where he finds himself now, in 2023, a starman in a brand-new galaxy, one dot in a different kind of constellation.So New Blue Sun isn’t really a solo record. It’s also not a bandleader record in the jazz sense, like Miles Davis’ Kind of Blue or John Coltrane’s A Love Supreme, where the name on the sleeve indicates the leader in the studio. It’s not the work of one person surrounded by exceptional musicians to help execute his vision; in that sense, New Blue Sun is even less of a solo record than The Love Below, André’s half of OutKast’s 2003 double album. On the first full-length release to bear his name and his name only, André 3000—a man who once christened himself Possum Aloysius Jenkins, Dookie Blossom Gain III, Funk Crusader, and Love Pusher, all at once—is oftentimes barely visible. He is a stick of nag champa perfuming the room of this record. He is a happy contributor to its world, one among many. The man who brought Afrofuturism to TRL has a new trick up his sleeve: He’s blending in.Like every OutKast record, New Blue Sun is the product of a community. Over the past decade or so, the worlds of ambient music, electronic music, jazz, beat music, free improv, and new age in Los Angeles have congealed to create a new and far-reaching style. It encompasses everything from the DIY dub jazz of Sam Wilkes and Sam Gendel to the harpscapes of Mary Lattimore to the fluid Ethio-funk of Dexter Story. Though there’s no real center to the scene, nearly everyone either has or is about to work with Carlos Niño—percussionist, producer, founding DJ of the influential internet radio station Dublab, and connective tissue in a city designed to discourage connection. You’d call him an instigator if his presence weren’t so gentle. The music he releases under the name Carlos Niño & Friends is technically complex and spiritually sincere. He invites a few people over, they improvise freely on whatever instruments are at hand, and Niño then chops, cuts, and shapes the jams into albums that swell with unspoken but easily understood feelings—André played flute on his album from earlier this year.",Experimental,8.3
614,"On an album-length EP, Kurt Vile finds darker shades to his gold-hued worldview. Kurt Vile’s time is slippery. Mondays melt unnoticed into Saturdays. The sun rises, sets again, then it all flows bassackwards. His lengthy records give the impression of a series of sunlit days, half-remembered in a haze. But if listening to Vile’s music can make one acutely aware of the transience of all things, the man at the center of these songs does not always seem conscious of this truth. He lives from moment to moment—often the moment of his songs’ creation, which he likes to narrate out loud, describing his writing process and shouting out his influences. He’s deeply self-aware, and if his new album-length EP, Back to Moon Beach, at first seems like a continuation of this thematic and sonic mindset, he has a ready-made response to anyone hoping for a mid-career switcheroo: “These recycled riffs ain’t goin’ anywhere anytime soon,” he sings on the title track.Back to Moon Beach consists largely of gold-hued guitar jams with simple chord progressions and generous runtimes. One of the first lyrics on opener “Another good year for the roses” is “These days I do whatever I want,” and Moon Beach at first seems like a commitment to this credo. The songs are filled with slacker hedges like “man” and “whatever.” Sometimes he won’t bother to write any words if a “woo” suffices. The title track suggests that “Moon Beach” is the mental landscape he escapes to while making music, and its distance from the daily grind seems aligned with idioms like “head in the clouds.”And yet the Vile character seems less content, less satisfied, less serene on these songs than on any he’s written since 2011’s Smoke Ring For My Halo. Some kind of dissatisfaction has set in, and it’s not so easy to just play it away. “Cup runneth over with lifeblood/Then it sprung a leak,” he sings on “Touched something (caught a virus),” before complaining about a migraine. “Like a wounded bird trying to fly” centers on a simile apparently written by his daughter Awilda. “Always did I love that line/But never did I apply it to myself ’til just then,” he sings. On “Blues come for some,” the sumptuous layers of guitar fall away, and we hear Vile alone at a piano, confessing: “Blues came to me in my dreams/And it stayed.” The cause of Vile’s blues is often ambiguous, though “Tom Petty’s gone (but tell him i asked for him)” suggests one answer. Vile wonders aloud what he might have said to his friend David Berman, or Tom Petty had he known him, before concluding that he might not have found anything to say: Bob Dylan is still alive, after all, and if Vile met him in person, he’d “melt down like a nuclear reactor.”",Rock,7.5
615,"The hyperactive New York sibling duo embraces genuine presence and warmth on its second album of the year. It feels like a radical reinvention. Angel and Lulu Prost aren’t known for their light touch. Since joining forces as Frost Children, the siblings have embraced face-melting maximalism as a guiding principle, drawing inspiration from the least subtle strains of EDM, electro-punk, and hardstyle as much as they do Spongebob Squarepants. Their wildly unstable approach to hyperpop is equal parts sugar and spice and knees and elbows; a riot of cartoon violence designed to climax in 15-second bursts of shout-along chaos. What supposedly distinguished them from high-octane acts like 100 gecs or the Garden boiled down to their location (New York City), frame of reference (aughts pop), and a spate of trend pieces situating them at the intersection of indie sleaze and (depending who you asked) the death or rebirth of downtown nightlife. But the music alone was proof enough that the Prosts were talented producers whose many good ideas waged war fruitlessly against each other.This spring’s SPEED RUN revealed Frost Children’s potential as hard-partying shit-starters while also highlighting the limits of their thinly drawn, attitude-heavy approach. But nestled among the pinging video game samples, shredded punk vocals, and Richter scale-moving drops were hints of a gentler and sweeter sound, one that swooned rather than sneered. You can hear flickers of it in the winsome Eurohouse beat of “All I Got” and the disarmingly romantic lyrics of the earlier “Worship U,” moments when the duo seemed to drop the act and grow a heart. Though recorded alongside SPEED RUN, Hearth Room is an infinitely more agreeable collection that introduces a new level of feeling to their work.Hearth Room feels like a radical reinvention but it’s the product of brutally effective fine-tuning. Gone are the meme lyrics, the relentless dance beats, the bratty antagonism. The songs follow more conventional pop structures and don’t get derailed by verbal or musical non sequiturs. When “Birdsong” peaks with a screamo wail, it feels like a moment of loving surrender rather than random dissonance. The Prosts play to their strengths as rock musicians while using electronic flourishes sparingly and strategically. On the stuttering, agitated “Stare at the Sun,” the siblings take turns spitting out visceral romantic disillusionment, as Lulu’s guitar and Angel’s bass lock horns in a tricky math-rock melody. As the beat fades, a flurry of jagged synths enters the mix before shifting suddenly into a punishing breakdown.Hearth Room reflects a set of influences that were not apparent from the sugar rush collage of SPEED RUN, specifically the windswept moodiness and passionate upsurges of Modest Mouse and Alex G. Much of the album concerns raw nerves and butterflies, the agony and ecstasy of longing for love and only fitfully getting it. Opening track “Lethal” bleeds out its dejection with bruising power chords before exhaling into the anguished couplet: “If I had a spine/You’d be mine.” The gentle synth-pop of “Marigold” sounds like a straightforward love song, and it peaks with Angel’s desperate plea: “Tell me lies, tell me lies/I believe you.”Fortunately Frost Children haven’t sacrificed their sense of humor. On “Oats From a Mug” and “Got Me By the Tail,” they express tenderness as a non-stop flow of absurdist sweet nothings. And then there’s “Bob Dylan.” Over twinkling guitar, Frost Children eulogize the decrepit state of urban bohemia by narrating the Nobel laureate’s journey through the now-vapid and over-commercialized sites where he first became an artist. “Tribeca/Hudson Yards/Bedford Ave and 7th/Rue Charlot in the Marais/That canal that’s in East London,” Angel intones, as if narrating a bitterly nostalgic Adam Curtis supercut. When she pauses to take in a poster advertising a (fictional) Jack Harlow-branded salad from Sweetgreen, it’s funnier and sadder than anything in the duo’s catalog.For years, hyperpop put on a shiny reflective front to baffle anyone who didn’t get the joke—if there even was one. But as a genre that once made such a play of flirting with capitalism gets subsumed by it, there’s never been a better time to prioritize emotional immediacy. With Hearth Room, Frost Children take a leap beyond ironic club-kid mischief to create a record that radiates genuine presence and warmth.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

616,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit the oddball rock maverick’s final studio album, a MIDI-powered vision of the uncanny and bizarre future of music. Imagine the dismay on Frank Zappa’s face when he concluded that not even the London Symphony Orchestra could help him realize his dreams of being a classical composer. With an entire philharmonic at his disposal, their three-day recording session in early 1983 was a complete mess. Members of the orchestra were skeptical of Zappa’s work, the sessions ran short on time, and the resulting albums, London Symphony Orchestra Vols. I & II, required laborious editing to correct all of the ensemble’s out-of-tune mistakes. After years of smashing his head against the wall trying to corral flakey rock musicians into pulling off his sky-high musical ambitions, the classical world turned out to be the biggest joke of all.Though employing the LSO might come off as needlessly opulent for most rock musicians, for Zappa it was a logical next step. Growing up in suburban Southern California, he had begun notating sheet music at 14, obsessing over Edgard Varèse and Igor Stravinsky records and forcing his friends to listen to them after school to test whether they got it or not. Varèse in particular enthralled a young Zappa, both in the French composer’s unbounded embrace of new electronics and the way he deconstructed his rhythms to question the very nature of what constitutes music. He embodied everything hilarious and futuristic that Zappa wanted to achieve.Of course, for an aspiring young musician, forming a rock band in your friend’s garage is a lot easier than assembling a chamber orchestra. But as Zappa climbed through the ranks of L.A.’s fried, shaggy underground scene in the ’60s and ’70s alongside his Mothers of Invention, he never shook off the habit of handling his band as if he were a conductor. Lined with twinkling marimbas and woodwinds, his albums were feats of studio wizardry that constantly seemed as if they were ripping apart at the seams. Whether he was stitching together tape collages on surreal opuses like 1969’s Uncle Meat, giving the prog bands a run for their money with the ornate rock symphonies of 1970’s Burnt Weeny Sandwich, or stirring together jazz fusion with big band arrangements on Hot Rats, he continually found ways to incorporate new, popular sounds while never fitting neatly into one box.The only thing that could outpace Zappa’s pen was his desire to blow raspberries at the hypocrisies of American culture, and in his classically Californian way, Zappa always let his own need for personal expression steer the ship. His juvenile sense of humor wasn’t for everyone—even if he saw his greatest commercial successes when he put it front and center on albums like Apostrophe (’) and Over-Nite Sensation—and his jokes often teetered between harmlessly eccentric and tastelessly bitter. He used his songs to make a stand against the mass-produced counterculture of the day, and to call out what he saw as corporate-approved rebellion being packaged and sold to the brainwashed masses. He came off as a crank, but for every cynical loogie spat at hippies, L.A. scenesters, and anybody else he deemed phony, there was a guitar solo so rippling with feeling that it was impossible to deny his freewheeling spirit.",Experimental,8.0
617,"N/A For a band whose touchstone would soon become obdurate slowness, Acetone certainly began on the record industry’s fast track. In the early ’90s, when music executives were quick with cash, the unproven trio of California students inked a deal with a nascent Virgin imprint on a demo alone. On the prowl for the next alt-rock crossover phenomenon, Vernon Yard—named for the English enclave where Virgin began two decades earlier—offered Acetone $400,000 (nearly a million today), making them the inaugural act on a roster that would soon include the Verve, Low, and David Gray.There were promotional budgets, tours with Oasis and Garbage, and the growing realization that their pained, gorgeous, and patient records could never actually recoup those kinds of post-Nirvana costs. This was not music for MTV but instead for a meditative and melancholy cloister, folks with the time and temperament to sit still with these graceful testaments to existential ache. After Vernon Yard dropped Acetone into a legacy of penury, they made two of indie rock’s most exquisite albums for Neil Young’s new Vapor label. Still, those didn’t take. And in 2001, at 34, bassist Richie Lee—whose twilit voice and heroin woes had been Acetone’s angel and devil—died by suicide. Ever since, Acetone have continued their descent into cultish obscurity, their records long out of print and mostly not streaming, a band on the fast track to the record industry’s wasteland.At last, I’m still waiting. puts Acetone on their proper pedestal as one of their generation’s most hypnotic acts. They are like Bedhead without the morning-time stiffness or Mojave 3 with more earworm ease, a band wrongly forgotten among contemporaries they often bested. A titanic 11xLP box set that collects almost all of Acetone’s recorded work, I’m still waiting. doubles as a love letter for three kids—Lee, drummer Steve Hadley, and guitarist Mark Lightcap—who were lured inside a vicious system that did not know what to do with their muted wonder except write it off as a loss. For the first time ever, their four LPs will be available at once (as a set and as standalone records) and eventually on streaming, having outlived both Vernon Yard and Vapor in aptly tragic fashion. Three decades after Acetone accepted that $400,000 check, their music still radiates a hangdog sort of hope, holding on even as the idea of letting go beckons.Amid the big-game hunt for the next Nirvana, Acetone looked and sort of sounded the part—Lee’s dirty grunge curls, the beautiful Hadley’s thousand-yard stare, Lightcap’s steely glower. Their Acetone EP, released in 1993, is a fiery baptism of distortion and dynamics, the first three songs grinding through Big Muff riffs and splenetic solos but pausing for uncanny spans of pillowed harmony. “D.F.B.,” a four-minute excoriation of a dead asshole, called “next” during a Stone Temple Pilots/White Zombie Rock Block. But then there’s closer “Cindy,” an imaginative and enigmatic eight-minute devotional about virginity or black-widow-like sacrifice or narcotized oblivion. The song is a seesaw, rising into heavy outbursts before falling repeatedly into quiet passages so vulnerable and delicate that they suggest rehearsal tapes, at least until you notice how intentional the playing is. No faint note is out of place, no twinge of dissonance accidental.",Rock,9.0
618,"With an uncharacteristically somber tone, the Detroit rapper's sixth album is his most introspective and confessional work to date. As an artist in a genre where emerging stars are rarely old enough to drive, let alone drink, Danny Brown has always seemed self-conscious about his age. His breakout mixtape, XXX, was titled in part to reference his age at the time. His next album title was even less subtle. Quaranta—“40” in Italian but also, a near-homonym for “quarantine”—arrives as Brown enters his fourth decade, and he’s called it a “spiritual sequel to XXX.” That’s a bit misleading though, because Quaranta is a very different record. Across a number of solemn, lyric-heavy tracks, Brown catalogs his regrets and owns up to his personal failings. If XXX felt like a never-ending carousel of sex and drugs, Quaranta feels more like sitting in a therapist's office processing the fallout from a decade of rockstar living.The last few years have given Brown a lot to unpack. A lifelong Detroiter, he relocated to Austin, Texas following a divorce; earlier this year he got sober after a stint in rehab. He wrote Quaranta during the initial wave of COVID lockdown and it sounds like it. Brown’s stance is isolated and reflective; he raps deliberately over sparse beats, his delivery more confessional than flamboyant. Where his previous albums approached similar topics (Old, in particular, attempted to reconcile Brown’s hedonistic lifestyle and traumatic childhood), the music and rapping were far more dynamic. On Quaranta, Brown’s acrobatic flows, ear for oddball beats, and dark sense of humor are in short supply.Brown has always been equal parts traditionalist and insurgent. While he led a wave of internet-fluent rappers who crossed over into indie and EDM, his mastery of storytelling and technique betrayed his love of ’90s hip-hop. He leaned into those sounds on 2019’s uknowhatimsayin¿, which was executive-produced by Q-Tip, and goes further on Quaranta, often dropping the nasal honk and frantic delivery in favor of a lower register and slower tempos. He’s never sounded more distant from the current wave of psychedelic rap he influenced, a fact that’s equally evident in his lyrics. The subject matter here is heavy and personal, even by Danny Brown standards—few rappers have aired out this sort of dirty laundry on record. “Down Wit It” delves into heartbreak and addiction (“Now it’s all over, can’t stay sober/Deep in my depression, hoping I can get over”) while “Quaranta'” undercuts Brown’s image with a grim dose of reality: “Lost everything in pursuit of my dream/Pushed everyone away, now no one here but me.”",Rap,6.5
619,"The New Jersey producer and Brooklyn rapper’s slanted, rhythmically intricate electronic rap album sounds beamed in from the future. The moment JWords and maassai crossed paths, collaboration was inevitable. After meeting at a showcase in 2017, the New Jersey producer and Brooklyn rapper each felt they’d found a kindred spirit, deciding to unite the former’s knotty production with the latter’s blunt introspection as the duo H31R. On their 2020 debut ve​·​loc​·​i​·​ty, JWords laid Jersey club rhythms and boom-bap drums atop warped loops as maassai unspooled philosophical examinations of self. Their new record, HeadSpace, is a confident expansion of their electronic rap vision, with wonky, alien-sounding songs that feel beamed in from the future.For HeadSpace, JWords followed the synth-based blueprint of ve​·​loc​·​i​·​ty highlight “toxic behavior,” a flurry of lightning-speed kicks and locomotive hi-hats that charges through soft fog. The songs seem to glow from within: Textured, harmonically rich pulses drive “Backwards” and “Glass Ceiling,” while “Static” and “Train of Thought” feature glassy FM tones. JWords’s percussion sounds are warm and rubbery; bass drums land with a gooey throb and every snare has a satisfying mechanical snap.It’s the duo’s manipulation of rhythm that makes HeadSpace so entrancing. JWords seems to delight in pushing syncopation to new limits, often starting with a certain sequence only to completely scramble it. The agitated line that opens “Glitch in Time” threatens to wriggle free at any moment, but the song locks into place once JWords adds a rigid latticework of clicks and beeps. “Backwards” fits a loping, atonal synth figure into a stuttering drum pattern, constantly playing with the location of the downbeats. Occasionally, songs end before the groove can fully breathe—the ghostly drum’n’bass of “All Over the Place” could be a sprawling dancefloor jam, but disintegrates after one minute.As a rapper, maassai is equally beguiling. She subtly stretches and compresses her husky voice, delivering each line with a slight sneer. At first blush, her lyrics read as swaggering shit talk—“I ain’t eat dinner yet/But I’m so full of myself I could skip it,” she boasts on “Train of Thought”—but they’re often cues for deeper self-examination. She frequently alternates point of view, giving her raps a dreamlike, psychedelic quality. “When you scared of me, I’m scared too/You look at me and see you,” she raps on “Reflection,” her voice somewhere between a coo and a growl.Together, JWords and maassai create songs that feel like expertly assembled puzzles. On “Down Down Bb,” maassai spits rapid-fire lines as JWords’ kicks hang off the edge of each phrase: “Let me get the rhythm of your head/Let me get the rhythm of your feet.” On the closer “Air It Out,” JWords constructs a mechanical churn while maassai repeats certain phrases as if subject to delay, adding swing to the track’s grid. On HeadSpace, two potent solo artists tap into and augment each other’s strengths, practicing a kind of understated alchemy that doesn’t sound quite like anyone else.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

620,"The Virginia rapper-singer is known for her boisterous rap concoctions, but her new album is a sparse showcase of moody, Auto-Tuned vocals that feel more like demos. When Babyxsosa first emerged in 2018 with “Beat My Ass,” there was a chirpy, nursery-rhyme quality to the Virginia rapper-singer’s voice. She sings sweetly, her feathery vocals floating through the din like a snowflake in a gust of wind. As her profile grew, she began dabbling in ’80s-style synth-pop, plugg, and harsh industrial techno, the latter of which sounded like Yeezus compressed to 8-bit. Her voice is the one constant, cutting through the digital fog even as the music shuffles around. It feels like a sliding block puzzle operated by someone amped up on two cans of Logan Paul’s Prime energy drink.Even for an artist prone to unexpected pivots, Babyxsosa’s new self-titled project feels like a left turn. Outside of its explosive centerpiece “Baby G,” the production is somber and stripped-back, consisting almost entirely of moody synthlines fit for a minimalist sci-fi film. That aesthetic choice puts more emphasis on Sosa’s vocals than ever, and she uses the extra space to lather her melodies in a cold, Auto-Tuned foam. It’s hard to make out the freestyled lyrics on “Introduction,” but her coos morph into ghostly wails over a yearning organ sample, her wistfulness overflowing with every breath. Babyxsosa is a radical departure from the boisterous sound she’s been tinkering with; “Beat My Ass,” this is not. She relies on these sparse vibes for the rest of the release with mixed results.Simple vocal refrains melt into the backgrounds of songs, every element weightless and floating towards the ceiling. “Never Know/Viral” lingers on unfiltered confessions that eventually give way to Kid Cudi-style crooning. At just a little under a minute and a half, the track evaporates and leaves little time for respite before the bludgeoning, Playboi Carti-indebted “Baby G” gallops in. Then the drums and horns fade into the ether, and she’s back to singing sweet nothings on “That’s Just What They Say When They Don’t Know You Like I Know You.” The tonal whiplash is bizarre but intriguing, the bones of a romantic theme peeking through these pared-down flights of fancy. Still, the mechanics aren’t foolproof. Outside of that dizzying three-song structure, these tracks feel so raw they sometimes resemble demos more than finished statements.The project’s boldest experiments are left for the end. On “I Found It,” Sosa goes full a cappella. It feels like a prelude to closer “I’m Over This Level of Life, My Love,” which takes up nearly half the project’s runtime; the song plays out like a slow ascent to the stars, accented by distorted screams and the throes of a crumbling relationship. “I Found It” is underwhelming because it takes its simple presentation a step too far; Sosa’s presence is diminished when she doesn’t have any other elements to play off of. The similarly brief “Never Know/Viral” wrings a lot of feeling out of a small package, and “My Love” capitalizes on the open space in its construction by letting the words and chords get tangled in a mass of angst and acceptance. You can’t knock her for experimenting, but sometimes she does leave more to be desired.Babyxsosa carries the weight of a self-titled release—an EP significant enough to get its own website with a handwritten song-by-song breakdown. Sosa’s strongest work usually has an anchor—a catchy melody, vocal fry, or standout line that functions as the foundation. It’s daring to follow this summer’s raucous and techno-drenched BLING BLING EP with 20 minutes of electro-chamber pop. But when the shock wears off, Sosa’s ideas feel static where they should be free. These days, rappers stretch the limits of their voices, indulge weighty concepts, and abandon rapping entirely. Sosa’s ambitions aren’t that grand here, but it’s unclear what exactly she’s aiming for. Her presence is still strong, but it’s hard to tell whether she wants to draw the listener in or keep them at arm’s length.",Rap,6.6
621,"Pairing songs rooted in classic Sufi poetry with electronic abstraction, the two experimentalists blur lines between cultures and eras in a moving tribute to the multiplicity of identity. In the spring of 2020, locked down in his New York apartment, Ali Sethi decided to turn his Instagram into a digital rehearsal space. At the same time every day, the Pakistani American singer and composer would sit down with his harmonium and tanpura, hit Instagram’s “Live” button, and spend an hour in freewheeling musical practice. He’d riff on Hindustani classical ragas, perform playful covers of South Asian classics, invite musician friends to log on and jam with him. It was during these sessions that he first began experimenting with spliced loops from Nicolás Jaar’s 2020 album Telas, improvising alaps over the Chilean American producer’s Stygian ambient soundscapes. When a mutual friend shared a recording of one of these experiments with Jaar, the producer reached out to Sethi via email. That kicked off a conversation that continues on their collaborative album Intiha, which features Sethi singing Urdu ghazals over re-worked loops from Telas, as well as new improvised sections courtesy of Jaar.On paper, the two seem unlikely collaborators. Sethi is best known for his experiments with the ghazal, a poetic-musical form that is the South Asian analog of the blues, with Sufi spiritual renegades singing songs steeped in metaphysical pathos. He may annoy Hindustani classical purists with his innovations—ragas re-imagined for piano accompaniment, Punjabi folk blended with synth-laden indie rock—but his music rarely strays far from mainstream-adjacent sounds. His 2022 breakthrough hit “Pasoori,” a collaboration with Pakistani singer Shae Gill, melds Punjabi folk, Turkish strings, and reggaeton beats into a thrilling romantic banger that would fit seamlessly on any Spotify pop playlist.Jaar’s music, on the other hand, seems to pull away from anything so obviously conventional or recognizable. Since breaking out with the minimalist techno of 2011’s Space Is Only Noise, he has pushed ever further into ambient abstraction. Even Against All Logic—his most accessible, dancefloor-friendly side project—bristles with harsh noise and gritty industrial textures. His solo work, particularly on Telas, resembles a primordial universe, swirling clouds of nebulous sound coming together and drifting apart in accordance with arcane physical laws.Yet somehow, maybe because both their practices are so deeply rooted in improvisation and recontextualisation, the meeting of these vastly divergent musical worlds isn’t as jarring as you might expect. When Sethi first sent Jaar voice notes with his vocal improvisations, Jaar realized that “it was what Telas had been missing.” Perhaps that’s why the record is called Intiha. The word translates as “limit” but can also refer to the point of “termination.” Having already released Telas in both “solid” (the four-track album) and “liquid” (an interactive website that allowed users to recombine the record’s sounds) configurations, Jaar may be signaling that this is the piece’s final, definitive form.",Folk,7.2
622,"A drum-free but otherwise identical new version of Random Access Memories brings the saga of Daft Punk’s 2013 album to a curious, unfulfilling end. What are we doing here? Honestly, what are we doing with this “drumless” edition of Daft Punk’s Random Access Memories? What possible lessons can we learn from 2023’s second re-edition of Daft Punk’s third-best album, in which every sonic detail is the same, other than the absence of drums? Why on earth did Daft Punk, one of the savviest musical duos in modern memory, choose to release a largely superfluous album, when they could have simply ridden the residual good vibes of RAM from earlier this year? Why would anyone choose to listen to Daft Punk’s meticulously crafted fourth studio album with the work of two of the world’s best session drummers wiped from the surface?In the absence of an official explanation, speculation has thrived. Some fans claim that RAM Drumless is intended for DJs and producers who want to create their own RAM mixes and bootlegs, a logical enough idea that doesn’t account for the pricey Drumless merch or the major-label system and its outright revulsion for copyright-busting fan-made remixes. The big news is that Random Access Memories (Drumless Edition) really is just that: Random Access Memories with the drums removed. There’s no slinky disco hi-hat on “Get Lucky,” no explosive snare fills on “Contact,” no gentle cymbal taps on “Within,” not even a click track on “Giorgio by Moroder.” If this were another group you’d suspect a radical art prank, a sardonic comment, maybe, on the importance of drums to the house and techno music with which Daft Punk made their name. But Daft Punk don’t seem the type.Stripping the glossy RAM productions of their percussion does give other musical elements room to breathe—the bass, for example, feels a lot more prominent on “Giorgio by Moroder,” and you can really pick out how Todd Edwards’ brilliant microsample patchwork on “Fragments of Time” relates to the song’s bass and guitar lines. My own theory around Random Access Memories is that Daft Punk’s fourth album is, in effect, two records: a disco/soft rock/house album that houses the radio hits and a much more interesting, proggy, swirly record that lies alongside. By and large, the disco tunes—“Get Lucky,” “Lose Yourself to Dance,” “Instant Crush”—sound bereft of life in their Drumless versions, a low-carb diet beer watered down within an inch of its life. But the prog-leaning songs—“Within,” “Beyond,” “Motherboard,” etc.—fare a lot better.At times the transformation is revelatory. “Beyond” and “Motherboard,” in particular, feel the breath of new light on RAM Drumless. Shorn of their percussive shuffle, the two songs’ Drumless versions allow the astral swoon of Greg Leisz’s pedal steel guitar to drift to the surface, creating a blissed-out ambient country music to rival The KLF’s classic Chill Out (or, indeed, RAM’s Japanese bonus track “Horizon”), while the subtle orchestral touches in both songs feel flush with vivid color. The cat’s cradle cobweb of acoustic guitar and increasingly elastic one-note bassline that briefly surface in “Motherboard (Drumless Version)” are enough to make this the definitive version of the song, even if it took a decade to get there.",Electronic,5.4
623,"No stranger to singing other people’s songs, Chan Marshall attempts her most ambitious cover project yet: an album-length recreation of a Dylan concert that changed the course of rock history. On May 17, 1966, Bob Dylan gave a performance that would go down among the most significant of his career. In the four years since his debut album, he’d reached a level of reverence usually reserved for religious icons, with listeners approaching his folk songs as if they were commandments for navigating the turmoil of their era. But he was enamored with the possibilities of rock’n’roll, whose live-wire rhythms pulled his songs away from oratorical gravitas and toward a stranger sensibility—one full of surreal asides, inside jokes, and social critiques from an artist who had begun to see himself and his cohort as participants in the world’s hypocrisy, rather than innocent observers. On this night in May, the tension between Dylan’s inspiration and his audience’s expectations was particularly raw, with band and crowd egging each other toward a frenzy that culminated with the most famous heckle in rock history: “Judas!” Fans came to know the show by the name on a bootleg recording, which circulated widely and soon became another pillar of the Dylan legend: Royal Albert Hall.Except it didn’t happen at London’s Royal Albert Hall; it happened at Manchester Free Trade Hall, all the way on the other side of England, 200 miles northwest. The historical mix-up prompted by the mislabeled bootleg was only sorted out for good in 1995—the same year, incidentally, that Chan Marshall released her first album as Cat Power. Her latest, Cat Power Sings Dylan: The 1966 Royal Albert Hall Concert, is a song-by-song recreation of his set list that night. Marshall has a good bit in common with Dylan: an elliptical approach to subject matter, a sometimes fraught relationship with her audience, a willingness to follow her muse far afield from the sounds that made her famous, and tone and phrasing that can channel something deep about her sources when they’re divergent on the surface. Her decision to record her rendition not at the actual location of Dylan’s famous concert but at Royal Albert Hall itself reveals another kindred aspect between his trickster spirit and her own: the understanding that myth can be just as powerful—in its way, just as truthful—as fact.At first approach, Cat Power Sings Dylan is as straightforward as covers albums come. Marshall performed the music live, following every contour of Dylan’s set, down to his switch halfway through from solo acoustic performance to rollicking full-band rock. She didn’t tinker much with his arrangements: If a given song, in Dylan’s rendition, begins with an instrumental vamp or ends with a harmonica solo, it probably does in Marshall’s version as well. But after a while, the meticulous literalism of her interpretation comes to seem like its own conceptual gambit. When the similarities are so pronounced, the differences, when they inevitably occur, capture your attention. In the decades since 1966, Dylan’s performance has been enshrined as a pivotal moment not just in his own career but in pop music’s history, proving that rock stars were artists who could challenge their audiences, not just satisfy or entertain them—a single unruly evening standing in for a generational shift. Marshall’s treatment of the concept, from the title and location on down, comes across as both an earnest tribute to the “Royal Albert Hall” show and a probing investigation of its legend.",Rock,7.3
624,"The American photographer reflects on the past with a collection of warm, intimate piano compositions influenced by traditional folk and gospel. William Eggleston’s music, like his photography, lives in vivid color. The 84-year-old artist helped establish color photography as a medium worthy of institutional attention, elevating what was once considered purely commercial to the level of serious art. His photos are shot quickly, yet retain an honest, lived-in quality—in part thanks to his longstanding preoccupation with domestic interiors, aloof inlaws, personal trinkets, and other eccentricities of the American South. Roving and somewhat stiff, his 2017 album Musik unearthed a side of the photographer’s life once relegated to footnote status, compiling decades-old recordings captured on a Korg OW/1 FD Pro synthesizer. 512, Eggleston’s newly recorded follow-up, features warmer and more spacious improvisational piano compositions with an intimate, wide-eyed charm.The album takes its name from the unit number for Eggleston’s Memphis apartment, where it was recorded, and the music itself has a loose, domestic feel. A gentle brush of incidental noise in the opening moments of “Improvisation” places Eggleston at the piano bench, muttering under his breath before he’s joined by Brian Eno on bells. Eno’s touches are light and restrained, distinctly secondary to the tense stabs from Eggleston. The recordings have some continuity with the modernist lineage of jazz, or perhaps minimalism by way of Eno, but are more strongly influenced by the traditional folk and gospel music played on upright pianos across the U.S. for so much of the nation’s early history. The result is delightfully anachronistic and full of life.The record’s liveliness is partly thanks to choices made by producer Tom Lunt, who joined Eggleston in Memphis for the recording sessions. As both co-founder of the Numero Group and the archivist responsible for breathing new life into Eggleston’s earlier material, Lunt has a deep understanding of tradition. He invited session musicians like Sam Amidon, Matana Roberts, and Leo Abrahams to perform on the record, each adding subtle flourishes. “Ol’ Man River” is stoic and melancholy, with rolling fiddle and banjo lines from Amidon. “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes” achieves a similar depth of feeling by way of Roberts’ rich saxophone, which peek through in the piece’s softest moments.While “Improvisation” and “That’s Some Robert Burns” are both original compositions, the album’s other four tracks are all American songbook standards. “Ol’ Man River,” “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,” and “Over the Rainbow” all began life as sentimental show tunes, while “Onward Christian Soldiers” is an Anglican hymn that dates back to the mid-19th century. This distinction is, however, ultimately of little consequence for Eggleston, who strays away from anything resembling convention with his improvisations. “Onward Christian Soldiers” moves from pulsing minimalism to discordant jazz and back again, while “Over the Rainbow” leans into the delicate “soft pedal” technique so closely associated with Harold Budd. But where Budd uses the technique to achieve an icy distance on Eno-assisted albums like The Pearl, Eggleston’s playing is strikingly present, with a pastoral glow.So much about the world has changed since Eggleston first took up the piano, his “first calling” before the camera, in the early 1940s. Where his earlier archival recordings can feel rote and mechanical, like a bit of idle rehearsal time, 512 shows Eggleston reinterpreting his own past and the Southern musical traditions he grew up with. Much like his photographs, which once felt outrageously ordinary, his music provides a snapshot of the changing conditions of his life. 512 looks back with a full-hearted delight.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

625,"The prolific saxophonist recorded this stark, searching album at 1:30 a.m. in an underground parking garage; it is both an exploration of negative space and an exorcism of ghosts. The wellspring of Patrick Shiroishi’s torrential output—last year his name appeared on 32 albums, and there is every indication that he will break that record this year—is a conversation he had with his grandmother. When Shiroishi was young, he asked her about the Japanese internment camp at Tule Lake, California, where the U.S. government incarcerated nearly 30,000 people during World War II and where she met his grandfather. Normally chatty and amiable, she suddenly went stonily silent. Shiroishi has since used his saxophone to excavate his family’s history and grapple with Japanese Americans’ collective trauma. His first solo album was dedicated to his grandmother, others to his parents and his aunt. Shiroishi’s breakout solo effort, 2021’s Hidemi, narrated his grandfather’s life after Tule Lake through beautifully dense, multilayered compositions. Even Shiroishi’s collaborations with others—in his own bands Fuubutsushi, SSWAN, and Oort Smog and in countless duos, trios, and quartets—are modeled after his grandfather’s life: specifically, the sense of community that Patrick Hidemi Shiroishi helped build, as a deacon and small businessman, in Los Angeles’s Little Tokyo neighborhood.I was too young to hear silence is the sparsest of Shiroishi’s releases, but its fragile improvisations also carry the weight of his family’s story. Recorded at 1:30 a.m. in a parking garage under a Japanese restaurant near his hometown of Rosemead, California, Shiroishi’s lone saxophone emanates from underground like the buried past crying out for remembrance. In the massive, empty building, trembling melodic lines are buttressed by long stretches of ambience, and sharp bursts of noise are met by reverberant echoes. Shiroishi cites the work of saxophonist Masayoshi Urabe, whose albums A Brute and Sōingyokusaiseyo are more silence than sound, as an influence on his minimalist approach. But just as important are location-dependent works like Pauline Oliveros’ recordings with the Deep Listening Band in an underground cistern or Akio Suzuki’s “o to da te” project, which maps points of strong echoes across urban areas. This isn’t the first time that Shiroishi has played in this garage—last year’s empty vessels, with Marta Tiesenga, was recorded there during the lockdown—but here he responds to the space as if it were the other half of a duo, an integral part of the unfurling composition.The album was recorded in one take with a saxophone, glockenspiel, two microphones, and portable recorder. As a document of a live performance, it combines the tension of an improv set with the petty thrill of trespassing. “stand still like a hummingbird” opens with several seconds of silence before short saxophone blasts reveal the garage’s cavernous resonance. Running water, perhaps from a custodian or shopkeeper washing up late at night, can be heard in the background. As Shiroishi’s improv progresses, he develops a language of piercingly high notes, fluttering runs, and breathy puffs of air, all of which cascade through the concrete passages of the garage and return slightly delayed and diminished.",Jazz,7.2
626,"The band’s sixth album is familiar and intimate, updated with touches of synth and drum machine but still rooted in melancholy brass and Zach Condon’s distinct baritone. The note of surprise on Hadsel, Beirut’s sixth studio LP, is not so much that Zach Condon has recorded an album on a remote Norwegian island with free access to a church organ, it’s that he hasn’t done so before. This sneaking feeling of familiarity is at the heart of Hadsel’s comfortable and occasionally underwhelming charm. Condon has, objectively, changed the Beirut sound since the Balkan brass days of Gulag Orkestar, his whirlwind 2006 debut. But his rich baritone croon, which swoops and curls around melodies like an eagle after a rabbit, is so distinctive, his brass arrangements so stridently mournful, that he can’t help but sound like himself.Hadsel, named after the municipality in which it was recorded, has its moments of reinvention. The use of the Hadsel kirke organ, whose ministerial drones underlie several of the album’s songs, introduces an austere, baroque elegance to the title track (especially) that is far removed from the ultra-bright tones of much modern pop music. For a blackened moment, the listener is transported to the hostile beauty and long nights of a Norwegian winter, the cold wind blowing around an icy wooden church. But as soon as the brass starts its stately call, we’re plunged right back into the world of Gulag Orkestar et al.At the same time, the modular synthesizers and drum machines that made their bow on 2019’s Gallipoli are more prominent on Hadsel. “January 18th,” “Spillhaugen,” and the second half of “Süddeutsches Ton-Bild-Studio” take on a borderline jolly, Switched-On Bach-style electronic wobble, while “Stokmarknes” and “The Tern” are marked by writhing electronic beats. But it almost feels like Condon has used these elements too well, weaving unfamiliar sounds around his lugubrious vocal so snugly that his invention slips by unheralded.This isn’t necessarily a problem, given the album’s lucidity and songwriting strength. Condon recorded Hadsel at a time of great personal difficulty, after health problems forced him to cut short Beirut’s Gallipoli tour in 2019. Upon arriving in Norway, he threw himself into recording as if “lost in a trance”; when he later returned to Berlin, rather than turn to his band for help, Condon fleshed out the Hadsel recordings on brass, percussion, and ukulele. The resulting sound is not exactly minimal, but it has greater clarity of purpose than Beirut’s more overblown records. This is an intimate, unflinching album that draws its power from Condon’s voice, which is frequently multi-tracked into giant choirs, like a lonely man who has invited his imaginary friends to a party.It remains thoroughly cathartic to hear Condon in full canorous flight, pushing simple vocal lines to grandiose conclusions. Drum machine aside, “So Many Plans” is a classic, horn-heavy Beirut heartbreaker in the style of “Elephant Gun.” “The Tern,” meanwhile, is a master class in pared-down songwriting, riding one melodic thought to towering emotional extremes. Condon went to Norway and came back with a familiar tangle of contradictions: Hadsel is a new beginning for Beirut that sounds like old times, a record born of despair and solitude that still feels full of life.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

627,"While the Japanese producer’s early music was grounded in footwork, he relegates rhythm to the margins on his latest EP, arranging his samples into wild abstractions and warped folk songs. Before Takahide Higuchi tried his hand at music, he dreamed of working as a game designer and bringing to life the fantasy worlds in his imagination. Though his initial experiments with RPG Maker software proved frustrating enough to put those ambitions aside, the Japanese producer’s abstract beatcraft under the name Foodman can often resemble the intricate worldbuilding of classic titles like Chrono Trigger and EarthBound. Inspired by the cut-and-pasted bricolage of footwork and juke, his songs are built out of tiny, chirping samples that skitter like 16-bit sprites ambling across the screen. Earlier works like 2021’s Yasuragi Land remained tethered to the conventions of club music, occasionally locking into bouncy four-on-the-floor grooves, but his new Uchigawa Tankentai EP is a detour into greater fragmentation.True to its title, which translates to “inner journey,” the record is guided by a loose, instinctual sensibility, evolving organically rather than following a linear progression. “Hajimari,” for example, develops like a screen-recorded playthrough of Pikmin. While you can distinguish the vague outline of a rhythm beneath the track’s chaotically deployed samples, it’s more interesting to observe it from a distant point of view, as a self-contained ecosystem. Insectoid synths warble and coo as if in conversation while tom drums, reversed hi-hats, and visceral squelching noises illustrate the collective efforts of a hive foraging for food and constructing shelter. In the album’s introspective focus, it’s as if Higuchi’s soul-searching had distilled emotion down to a cartoon symbiosis between neurons and gut flora.Elsewhere, Higuchi inserts his own voice into the soundscape, turning splintered pieces into warped folk songs. On social media and in interviews, Higuchi often cites private moments like cold baths or lunches eaten alone as sources of inspiration, and on opener “Pichi Pichi,” he imitates the strained croak of an old man, waxing nostalgic about the texture of perfectly crisp potatoes and warm summer days as metallic synths clatter in the distance. The blend of sounds can be disjointed and sour, but that imperfection is by design. These sound like the tuneless songs you might sing to yourself while doing chores: snippets of naive expression that lend human intimacy to Foodman’s digital songcraft.Covering five tracks in just 10 minutes, Uchigawa Tankentai is one of Foodman’s shortest releases. There’s charm in its diminutive scale, though a track like the 90-second “Hoso Michi” would benefit from further development. The interplay between its dissonant chords and MIDI choral arrangement is fascinating—like Anthony Braxton composing on a Dreamcast’s sound chip—but the song explodes into a whirlwind of drums and screams before the atmosphere can take hold. Despite its brevity, the EP succeeds as an opportunity for Foodman to steer his already eccentric artistry in a number of new directions without disrupting the flow of more conceptual LPs. Embracing the post-structural freedom evident in his earlier releases, it’s some of his most expressive—and challenging—work yet.",Experimental,7.1
628,"The Bay Area rock band refines its chaotic energy on its concise, catchy, and semi-ridiculous debut. Spiritual Cramp have their very own Bez. Jose-Luna Gonzalez is the Bay Area band’s tambourine-playing mascot, popping up at their shows to provide auxiliary percussion and an extra sense of chaos to a group, usually outfitted in Fred Perry, who look like they could beat the shit out of you. Spiritual Cramp haven’t entirely carried this anarchic energy to their self-titled debut. Clear-cut and wound tight, there’s nothing here that could be considered auxiliary or chaotic. Across 10 tracks, the band packs in precise, hook-centered anthems with inspiring choruses: music made for people with a tried-and-tested vinegar solution for wiping the blood off their Brentham bombers.Taking their name from a Christian Death song, Spiritual Cramp are among a wave of bands, including MSPAINT, Militarie Gun and Turnstile, who emerged from hardcore backgrounds and broadened their palettes to include softer, artsier flourishes. While those bands take their primary influences from the East Coast, Spiritual Cramp are proud anglophiles. Spiritual Cramp plays like a callback to 1977, when the Clash realized the natural alliances between punk and reggae, filtered through a hard-sashwaying garage rock lens. Spiritual Cramp integrate dub, spiky guitars, and oi-like crowd-starters, all with a kitschy wink rather than flatly imitating their predecessors. The music is ecstatic rather than enraged, semi-ridiculous rather than self-serious.As a frontman, Michael Bingham sounds like the kind of guy who insists on snuffing out a candle with his fingers. You can practically hear the pressure of his clenched-fists in the steady burble of his rabble-rousing voice. Across Spiritual Cramp, he switches between hubristic pomposity and a less mannered call for help. The album’s sequencing is buttressed on this swing: the pendulum ride between the imperious coke come-up and the humbling consequences of the come-down. “I wanna fly everywhere and put the miles on my credit card,” Bingham sings on “Slick Rick” like Iggy Pop at his puffed-up peak, before beginning the next song, “Talkin’ on the Internet,” with his tail between his legs: “Another day/Another credit card declined,” he whines.Bingham connects the political with the personal in the most on-the-nose way possible. “There’s a war on the TV and a war in my head,” he sings on “City on Fire” over a prickly guitar line. Bingham makes no attempt to be coy or subversive. His antiauthoritarianism scans gleefully teenage, his gestures deliberately vague. This isn’t to the band’s discredit: They’re striving for London Calling universality while knowing that cultural commentary isn’t their strong suit. Luckily, the songs are catchy enough to get away with it.What Spiritual Cramp might lack in blood, it makes up for with zippy efficiency. The band pulls the focus away from its propensity for carnage and toward their instinctive sense of melody, trading disorder for a methodicalness that galvanizes rather than placates. It’s a smart move, and one that plays surprisingly well to their anthemic tendencies. Slick and indelible, Spiritual Cramp inspires the same kind of fist-pumping and pogo-ing as the band’s unhinged live shows.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

629,"Like Olivia Rodrigo if she were raised on P!nk, 26-year-old singer Arabella Latham writes shiny, uncynical pop songs full of sarcasm, screw-ups, and young-adult heartache. Arabella Latham has the resume of someone who’s had an awesome start to her 20s. The South African singer-songwriter, who records as Baby Queen, made the BBC Sound of 2022 shortlist, then followed up by hosting a video-game music show for the Beeb with, it must be said, some pretty deep cuts. She was crowned the sound of the Netflix young-adult series Heartstopper, appearing first on the soundtrack, then in a cameo. She’s toured with pop’s reigning It Girl, labelmate Olivia Rodrigo. Courtney Love called her music “immaculate.” These are the sorts of successes one might expect from an artist who stormed the music industry with an Excel spreadsheet of every music blog going. On record, however, Baby Queen is a scrappy outsider, singing about how she alienates her friends, can’t get her shit together, and makes “art-pop music about the drugs I’m using.”Baby Queen is, in short, having a quarter-life crisis, a phrase Latham hadn’t encountered until she was midway through making her album and well into one of her own. The reason we have a phrase for this particular stasis, of course, is because lots of twentysomethings experience it—including those who write songs. And Quarter Life Crisis has plenty of millennial counterparts, like Colleen Green’s burnout anxiety on I Want to Grow Up, the bitter stoner teen-pop of short-lived aughts band Shut Up Stella, or P!nk’s second album Missundaztood—an album that is to Baby Queen and her peers what Britney is to the bubblegum-bling girlies.In interviews, Latham has mentioned the “parameters” of the Baby Queen project, and the sorts of songs that do and don’t fit them: “I could sit down at a piano and write a song that’s not hyper-satirical and cynical, but would it feel like it’s quintessentially Baby Queen?” Yet she and longtime producer King Ed are clearly drawn to shiny, uncynical pop, and out of the dozens of songs Latham recorded for Quarter Life Crisis, that’s largely what made the cut. The first sounds on the album—the choral pings of “We Can Be Anything”—suggest that Latham’s logged some serious hours with the least cynical song ever: “Don’t Stop Believin’,” Glee. The single builds into an anti-nihilistic fantasy of the best possible outcome of crying at a party (“Which is not unusual of me”), receiving and then spreading the epiphany that your whole life is ahead of you: Think Girls via Zombo.com. The onslaught of optimism is undeniable—even if you can imagine the saccharine commercial it might soundtrack.",Pop,6.7
630,"On its first album in seven years, the Detroit punk band balances grid-like rigidity with the sense that everything is about to fall apart. In the seven years since Tyvek’s last album, the Detroit punks went digging through their archive. They reissued a rare 2009 cassette and put out a live album where they dusted off and ripped through some of their earliest songs. Among those deep cuts was 2007’s “Future Junk,” an evergreen gem where Kevin Boyer screams about the daily grind of driving up and down the John C. Lodge Freeway. Tyvek return to the Lodge on “M-39,” a standout banger from their wild fifth album, Overground. Over a cascading and crunchy guitar riff, amid a blanket of unrelenting cymbal smashes, Boyer’s trademark blunt and unflashy vocal performance helps transform the freeway into a psychedelic colony chiseled into cement. He twists the same handful of words into knots so that when he eventually utters the phrase “writ large on the Lodge,” it lands like a punchline.Boyer offers landmarks and clues, but otherwise his imagery feels like a puzzle with half the pieces sucked up into the vacuum. The guitar sound is choppy and rigid as ever, and there’s a relentlessness to the sequencing that’s been there for the last two or three Tyvek albums. Each song spills rapidly into the next, and rarely does the band ease up. “Return to Format” and “Rhythm / Pattern” are ramshackle as Boyer spits his words percussively while the band careens behind him. There’s a moment on “Going Through My Things” when he appears to suddenly recite the tag of an old shirt: “LOW tumble dry, LOW tumble dry, LOW,” he shouts in the approximate rhythm of a dryer’s spinning drum. Tyvek excel at this strange balance between grid-like rigidity and the sense that everything could fall apart at any moment.While Tyvek have always been a revolving door of contributors (Boyer notwithstanding), the current incarnation has been steady for a few years now. It’s palpable just how much they’ve locked in with each other. Boyer and Shelley Salant are both on guitar, and many songs reward a close listen for their intertwining, jam-forward leads. The rhythm section is strong, which is expected for two Southeast Michigan DIY scene bosses in their own right, bassist Alex Glendening (Deadbeat Beat) and drummer Fred Thomas (too many bands to list). The most obvious new ingredient is Emily Roll, Salant’s bandmate in the art-punk trio XV. Their saxophone folds in effortlessly, never dominating with an overwhelming skronk or longform voyage. Roll mirrors the pointed and staccato nature of the guitars—a blurt here, a couple supplemental notes there. It’s a new texture and a lightly sour contrast to the main hook. Right in step with Boyer’s songwriting, it’s the most exciting kind of disorienting.",Rock,7.6
631,"The teenage newcomer’s latest EP is a maximalist maelstrom of frothy hi-hats and hazy synths. It contains flashes of brilliance, but sometimes falls back on cheap imitation. In a studio vlog from 2022, rapper-producer SEBii is gobsmacked as he talks to the comparatively reserved 16-year-old che. He reflects giddily on the “new genre” they’ve created with “euphoria,” one of che’s first songs to break through the SoundCloud rap underground. (Spongebob narrator voice: It wasn’t a new genre.) The track is still incredible: tactile and minimal, built on shards of digital glass. It offered a respite from the blaring rage beats that everybody was hopping on after Playboi Carti dropped Whole Lotta Red and LA-via-Portland rapper Yeat forged a real path to stardom in this lane.A year later, che has all but abandoned that stripped-back brand of hyper-rap, exploring a  maximalist and orchestral sound with producer Natecxo. The songs on his Halloween EP Crueger continue the creative partnership established on last summer’s dizzying album closed captions. These are frothy geysers of hi-hats and synth work, and che’s voice is the glowing orb that guides you through the haze. You’ll catch a decent line here and there, but his approach is less about bars, more about texture—hitting a turn of phrase like that. When he weaves his vocals through the laser beams of “Badu,” he sometimes disappears in the storm, but his punched-in melodies are so fluid and hypnotic that it doesn’t really matter. In the studio, che will hunch over a laptop with the mic next to him and engineer himself meticulously to achieve this level of detail, one hand on the mouse as he raps, a smattering of presets smeared on his vocals.Peep the original artwork for Crueger, a clear homage to Chief Keef’s Dedication, and it might start to make sense: che is just another teenage Sosa disciple, pushing the Chicago rapper’s  atmospheric and electronic hits into wall-of-sound territory. Unlike the glut of producers emailing Keef-type “glo” beats to Summrs and Sexyy Red, Natecxo and che go for something riskier behind the boards, often just by cranking everything up. See the bombastic “Sayso,” which throws a marching band stomp into a maelstrom of melodies; the blooming organ and bass is turned up to speaker-detonating levels, like one of those DMV rap beats from hell. On the following track, “Busan,” che’s vocals—submerged under big, blocky bass—struggle to come up for water, but the payoff is the swathe of chaotic, button-mashed filters at the end. It’s head-spinning music, for better or worse.",Rap,6.5
632,"The New York rapper’s tenth album showcases his turn from athletic feats on the mic to more expressive modes, backed by some of his best production yet. Aesop Rock opens his tenth album with a parody of Silicon Valley corporatespeak. “ITS is a system of industry applications designed to curate a desired multi-experience,” he says over a pastiche of ’80s synthpop. “Using a unique hybrid of machine learning and on-site scrum sessions, our specialists have redefined tech-centric problem-solving. Disrupt. Innovate. Refine.” The technobabble pokes fun at both TED talkers and Aesop Rock’s reputation for verbosity. A Def Jux alum and Rhymesayers signee, he knows the taste of word salad. He also knows none will be served on Integrated Tech Solutions, a smorgasbord of stories, images, and textures. The record builds on Aesop Rock’s decade-plus of rehabbing his style, which has shifted from gnarled abstraction to bug-eyed omniology.Aesop Rock still raps in lurching torrents of interlocking syllables and layered rhymes, but his delivery has grown more rhythmic and laid back, more conversational than combative. His production has come a long way, too; what was once functional scaffolding has become a pillar of his music. He’s now more interested in rap as expression than athletic feat, a turn that has made his songs more deliberate and searching. With this refined skill set and vision, he’s made subjects as trivial as skateboarding at night and as fantastical as a superpowered bullfrog feel engrossing and personal. That casual fluency drives Integrated Tech Solutions, an album loosely about life under technocracy. In a world where artists have been reduced to brands and data points, Aesop Rock asserts his multiplicity.The record boasts some of his most fully realized songs. “Living Curfew,” a song about the magic of golden hour in a city, darts from a stoop to a Flatbush Avenue bodega to the bloodwork from Aes’ latest doctor visit, each detail rendered in 4K yet propelling the verse forward. The images accumulate like a Katamari ball, swelling into “Whirlwind country/A world flushed from the brush pen of Kim Jung Gi/Swirling, junkyard tires and loveseats and house pets/All swept up into one beast.” The trip-hop beat’s crawling bassline and looped moans heighten the flood of details; the song feels like wading into a mural. And that’s before billy woods sweeps in with an equally omniscient verse about witching hour, that other magical time of day.Single “By the River” is just as exquisite. Rapping over a loop of soft percussion and a jazzy horn, Aes confesses his love of rivers. East, Hudson, Amazon, Willamette, Susquehanna—he admires them all, communing with a beaver and the ghost of his departed friend Camu Tao in a winding verse that’s broken up by the simple declaration, “I like rivers, I like rivers.” It’s the rare concept song that is as revelatory as it is intricate.Aes does a lot of storytelling on this album, extolling the beauty of pigeons on “Pigeonemetry,” memorializing his late grandma on “Vititus,” and narrating a bizarre home invasion on “Aggressive Steven.” The latter gets unwieldy as the story drags on, but Aes’ rhythmic virtuosity shines in this narrative mode. He’ll often insert an exclamation or aside to imbue a line with color, or to transition into a different flow or rhyme scheme. “Mr. T is fucking real?” he spit-takes on “100 Feet Tall,” channeling the astonishment he felt when his family ran into the celebrity in the ’80s. On the Watchmen-referencing “Salt and Pepper Squid,” a monologue about mentoring younger skaters sidles into a conversation: “I like to help the younger rippers clip up/A little hype to reignite the nimbus when they hiccup/How’s your weekend?/Is it house on a beach with a view, and tea for two?” Elite technique is clearly second nature for him at this point, but he’s constantly in search of ways to rap his ass off without showboating.The production is just as accomplished and purposeful. Outsourcing just one beat, he goes full mixmaster. On “Infinity Fill Goose Down,” chopped and scratched vocals, squiggles of funk guitar, and an arcade cabinet’s worth of synths fade in and out over nimble percussion. Pigeon coos undergird the ornithological paeans of “Pigeonometry;” porch-stomp drums thunder over reverbed electric guitar on “Bermuda”; a burping bassline loops over a crisp breakbeat on “All City Nerve Map.” He’s long been an omnivorous producer, but he’s recently learned to emphasize rhythm as much texture. (This applies to his verses too: His odes to junk food on “Time Moves Differently Here” straddle the bass notes like a lover, his slowed flow drawing out the pleasure of every delicacy.)As on Spirit World Field Guide and The Impossible Kid, a fear of mortality lurks beneath the levity and wonder. In addition to his typical jokes about being a hermit and living fossil (“Aes from before the first Star Wars/I survived Action Park, I survived lawn darts),” he also ponders the legacy of his art. In an interlude, he considers the arc of Vincent van Gogh, who was considered a failure in his lifetime. Van Gogh is the patron saint of flop eras; people evoke the Dutch painter when they need validation during perceived downturns. But for Aes the prolific post-Impressionist is interesting because he was productive, period. Even if his art hadn’t survived, he still made it, a devotion that inspires Aes. Integrated Tech Solutions illustrates how that commitment continues to deepen even as Aesop Rock eyes the clock. “O death, o death, could ya please hold a moment?/I am so in effect,” he raps on closer “Black Snow.” He’s got more to say.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

633,"The endlessly adaptable Chilean star flexes her versatility across synthy bossa nova, breezy trip hop, pummeling dance-punk, and dirty perreo. You might think you know the Chilean pop chameleon Mon Laferte, but allow her to reintroduce herself. The 40-year-old artist’s best work revolves around grief-stricken ballads—the kind you might blast in your depression dungeon while surrounded by smelly laundry and dirty dishes. Her videos and costumes have evoked the glamour of pin-up girls and rockabilly up-dos. But anyone who has tried to pin down Laferte to a singular mode has been sorely mistaken: She has experimented with SoCal folk-pop (2021’s 1940 Carmen), gloomy cumbia (2018’s Norma), and yearning boleros (many songs on 2017’s La Trenza).Her new album Autopoiética is a refusal of stasis by an artist now 20 years into her career: “I’m a big bitch, star machine, microparticles subdivided into interspatial nanoparts,” she quips on “40 y MM,” breaking down her ineffability. Autopoiesis, a term coined by Chilean biologists Francisco Varela and Humberto Maturana in the 1970s, describes the cyclical self-maintenance of cells; Laferte adopts the scientific vernacular as a metaphor for the endless redefinition of self as she strays from nostalgic idioms and dabbles in pummeling dance-punk and dirty perreo. She lampoons anyone who tries to define her by fixed gender roles—“Not a beauty queen/Not a whore nor a princess”—while asserting her own pleasure: “Préndele Fuego” is a babymaking bossa nova tune where Laferte sings of the joys of sitting on her partner’s face and getting fingered on the dancefloor. In her words, this album is for the MILFs, maestras, and “hardcore señoras.”One of the most thrilling left turns is “No+Sad,” an antidepressant dosed with 40 milligrams of goth reggaeton. Over blaring sirens and a spiky dembow riddim that rumbles under her vocals, Laferte seems to address the vitriol she’s faced as a cultural agitator. She snubs the haters who insult her “saggy breasts” and label her a communist, feminazi, and “tacky fucking bitch” (“pinche naca”), rehashing this slander in a coy whisper. It’s one of three songs on the album where she speaks in hushed tones, instead of reprising the maximalist vocal performances she’s known for. If anything, her words are more arresting when murmured. Meanwhile, “Tenochtitlan” and “40 y MM” illustrate Laferte’s love of Portishead, wading in the mellow tempos and airy vocals of ’90s trip-hop to tell a moving story about her immigration journey and longing for artistic freedom—another stylistic adventure.Still, not everything feels fresh. “Mew Shiny” is an old-school ballad, reminiscent of classic rock, that teeters on cloying sentimentality, one of the record’s weakest moments. Luckily, Laferte embellishes some of the traditional songs with clever adornments and sharp reversals. At first glance, “Pornocracia” is a bolero sex jam, but a second reading reveals it as a rebuff of an objectifying partner. “Casta Diva” is an orchestral epic that interpolates the 19th-century Italian opera Norma by Vincenzo Bellini, accompanied by a divine string section and a macabre church choir. In the final minute, a thunderous boom and a steady dembow riddim crash into the production. Laferte’s voice, once the embodiment of seraphic bliss, short-circuits into unintelligible digital glitch.While some of Laferte’s previous work verged on pure nostalgia, Autopoiética transcends mere reverence for the past. The choice looks good on her. Autopoiética challenges anyone who dared to relegate Laferte to late-career stagnation: She insists on boundless transformation.",Pop,7.5
634,"On a gothic and stormy new album, the experimental producer and vocalist constructs alien landscapes whose unpredictable structures seek to tune us more deeply into ourselves. On Death Is Home, Aïsha Devi arrives with the clearest and most distinct version of her sound yet. Defined by a sense of gothic scale and darkness, it’s rave music with a brain and a heart—for lone adventurers rather than big rooms. To understand it, one must take Devi’s entire discography into consideration: As Kate Wax, she made cloudy dance-pop—music that could have been dismissed as airy and transitory yet carried a strange and sometimes clunky heft. In 2014, the Swiss-Nepalese/Tibetan artist began releasing music under her own name, ditching the alter ego for a more avant-garde vision. She also began interweaving her meditation and spiritual practices into her production and performance. (Much ink has been spilled on the dancefloor as a space for potential healing; Devi appears to take this approach genuinely.)DNA Feelings (2018) was a disorienting, minimalist affair that placed Devi’s heavily processed vocals against pristine, icy sound design. Hard to grasp and even harder to dance to, it’s a challenging but rewarding listen that demands patience and careful attention—Pauline Oliveros for the clubland set. Death Is Home is her first LP since then, and first new music since 2019’s S.L.F. EP, which married Devi’s earlier predilection for pop with DNA Feelings’ abstract map. Opener “Not Defined by the Visible” turns the rave build into a dizzying spiral staircase, the kind everyone expects to resolve into a reliable drop and attendant emotional payoff. In Devi’s version, it becomes delicate architecture, refusing obvious catharsis for a sense of vertigo.Devi is an expert at building tension; a sense of foreboding lurked even in DNA Feelings’ relatively weightless palette. On Death Is Home she pushes that tendency as far as it will go, creating cavernous environments with such a restrained hand that when stabbed with squeaky synths and ruptured with dry, piercing kicks, as on “Lick Your Wounds,” they suggest the score for a sci-fi/body horror flick. “Immortelle” is just gorgeous, scribbly trance synths and ominous ambience anchoring Devi’s alien-frequency vocals. Visionary Kenyan club experimentalist Slikback helps the thrilling “Dimensional Spleen,” with its twinkling synth line and straight-to-the-hips bass, become the most accessible work of Devi’s recent career, though the track is no less thoughtfully constructed than anything on DNA Feelings.At times Devi sounds as if she’s playing with the new age tropes of a particular kind of ’90s mainstream electronica, digging through the cheese to find something true. The celestial bells of “Mind Era” and fluted synths of “The 7th Element” wouldn’t be out of place on Pure Moods. The references feel loving—new age was music for seekers and meditators, just as Devi’s is—but she can’t resist messing with the program, processing her vocals beyond recognition and screwing up the song structures. “Prophet Club” is a lovely slice of futuristic R&B. Closer “Azoth Eyes” is a true stunner, showing that Devi is as adept with percussion-heavy work as she is with airier fare. She sets gauzy layers of fluttering vocals against thick, ominous ambience and crushing, distorted beats, creating an atmosphere that works on and within the physical body.",Electronic,7.4
635,"Recorded outdoors during the pandemic with bassist Anna Butterss and guitarist Jeff Parker, the Chicago percussionist’s sunny, vibey jazz record brings back a distinct era of rediscovery and anti-nostalgia. If it sounds like Daniel Villarreal is rediscovering his drum set in real time in the opening moments of Lados B, that’s because—in a way—he is. He creates a groove one thwack at a time, poking gingerly at his cowbells and woodblocks as if to make sure they still work, building a curtain of percussion for nearly a minute on “Traveling With” before bassist Anna Butterss and guitarist Jeff Parker come in. The sessions of “high-level spontaneous music” documented on Lados B were recorded in October 2020 and represent the first time any of the three participants collaborated with another living musician after the beginning of the COVID pandemic––an arrangement possible thanks to International Anthem founder Scottie McNiece, who allowed the three to record in his backyard in L.A. There are no bird chirps or distant lawnmowers to let you know they’re recording outside, but there’s a lot of sunshine on this low-slung funk record—and a bit of bittersweet anti-nostalgia for the generator shows, street-corner open mics, and outdoor jams that defined the first stirrings of live music on the other side of lockdown.Some of these recordings ended up on Panamá 77, Villarreal’s debut from last year, but Lados B zooms into the raw material recorded during their two-day jaunt in McNiece’s garden. Panamá was fierce and fiery, with Villarreal seemingly hell-bent on meeting the high stakes hanging over any debut album. Lados B is looser, and the tempo rarely exceeds a mid-tempo lope; on “Things Can Be Calm,” he ditches his kit entirely to play kalimba through a ghostly patina of metallic echo. Rather than a clattering virtuoso attacking his drums, it’s easier to imagine Villarreal as a sturdy and sedentary presence—the bole of a mighty tree, with his arms as the branches and the continuous wall of percussion as the rustling of the leaves. Butterss’ basslines are spare and precise, resting atop Villarreal’s beds of percussion. Parker borrows some tricks from his great 2021 album Forfolks, including using a looping pedal to elongate single notes and create lustrous ambient drones that free him from the obligation of playing chords.The overall vibe is less reminiscent of Panamá 77 than Butterss and Parker’s last collaboration: the sumptuous live album Mondays at the Enfield Tennis Academy, which is a thousand times more fun and front-porch-friendly than an improvised double album named for a David Foster Wallace reference has any right to be. That album folded hip-hop beats and ambient textures into its stately tribute to cool West Coast jazz, and so does Lados B, which has fewer tracks than Panamá but is slightly longer despite advertising itself as an album of B-sides (the literal translation of its title). The band nicknamed the garden in which they recorded “Chicali Outpost,” a reference to its California locale and to Parker and Villarreal’s roots in the fertile Chicago jazz scene International Anthem has been documenting for almost a decade. On top of sounding like the kind of place Hemingway might’ve sipped cool rum cocktails and pecked out a novella, it’s a name true to the record’s spirit: the restlessness and open-mindedness of the Chicago scene, pitched at the woozy tempo of G-funk and Palm Desert stoner rock.International Anthem likes to follow up its tentpole releases with albums that serve as prequels, hyperlinks, or featurettes. A few months ago, UK saxophonist/poet Alabaster DePlume followed up his spoken-word epic Gold with an album called Come With Fierce Grace that documented the sessions from which the record emerged. Lados B serves a similar function to Fierce Grace and likewise inhabits a completely different sound and mood than its predecessor. The jams on Lados B sound slightly tentative at times; Parker never quite figures out what to do on opener “Traveling With,” and nearly all the songs begin with one musician introducing an idea and the others following, betraying the songs’ roots as essentially warm-ups. But it’s a testament to the trio’s formidable skills that Lados B hangs together despite the circumstances of its creation. On top of its bona-fides as a warm-weather album, Lados B provides the pleasure of hearing three top-tier players rediscover the joys of playing with each other in real time.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

636,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit the debut album by the positive-thinking Swedish pop group whose fusion of synth-pop and reggae became a preposterous international success. In the early 1990s, four unassuming Swedes created a snappy, newly digitized sound that took hold of the world. Ace of Base locked into a style that radio programmers, record execs, and fans latched onto with equal fervor, devising an unheard-of blend of upbeat synthpop cranked with a reggae-influenced bottom end that ushered in a renaissance of Swedish pop imports that continues to dominate charts to this day. But for siblings Jonas, Jenny, and Malin “Linn” Berggren and friend Ulf Ekberg, all in their early 20s at the time, the quick ascent was a surreal head trip. “I never thought I’d come anywhere in the world,” Jenny, one of Ace of Base’s singers, admitted in 1994, at the height of the band’s multimillion-selling peak. “I figured maybe I would see all of Europe, and that would be it.” Yet with the group’s unstoppable debut album, The Sign—which, at over 26 million units, remains one of the best-selling albums of all time—the band quickly went much farther.The Berggrens grew up in Gothenburg, an industrial port city on the western coast of Sweden. The siblings studied classical music in school, and as they grew older each found a musical outlet: While sisters Jenny and Linn sang in a church choir, older brother Jonas became an Italo disco obsessive who sported a rattail and bleached hair and performed in local bands that traded in New Romantic synth-pop. By the late ’80s, he entered a Swedish government program for aspiring musicians, which afforded him a rehearsal space and some cheap equipment to experiment with. There he worked on music that combined melodies inspired by ’80s synth-pop legends Depeche Mode and A Flock of Seagulls with thrumming percussion that shared the nervy pulse of Kraftwerk. A poster bearing the latter band’s name hung in his studio like a talisman.At 20, Ekberg was coming out of a phase as a member of a skinhead gang—he’d performed in a neo-Nazi group called Commit Suiside, a fact that haunted Ace of Base when they first got famous and European reporters picked up on it. He blamed banal reasoning for his past: “I used to indulge in drugs and violence, which culminated in my association with the worst form of rebellion: the skinheads,” he said in a statement released the same year as The Sign in a minimal effort at damage control. “I now regret all of this, but I can hardly change the past.”Despite his history, Jonas and Ekberg struck up a friendship as they worked on separate music in the same rehearsal space. Jonas, eager to start a band of his own, enlisted his sisters Jenny and Linn to supply cheery vocals, forming the first iteration of a group called Tech Noir after the night club in The Terminator. When the original bassist missed a performance to catch a Rolling Stones show the same night, Ekberg filled in and formally replaced him. As they created new demos together, reggae groups often rehearsed down the hall—the genre was gaining popularity in the country by the early ’90s, as local acts like Dr. Alban reworked the sound with a Eurodance pulse. The coincidental proximity of working reggae musicians exerted an osmotic influence on Jonas and Ekberg, setting off a lightbulb that transformed their music for good. They grafted reggae’s spacious groove and off-beat percussion onto their own chirping synth-pop, creating a sweet spot in the middle.",Pop,8.0
637,"Undergoing personnel changes and toying with new technology, the band changed gears in 1998, adopting an atmospheric sound that left both longtime fans and recent converts scratching their heads. In February 1999, R.E.M. walked into a Los Angeles nightclub to tape an episode of Fox’s prime-time drama Party of Five. “Who would have thought we’d ever do stuff like this?” bassist Mike Mills quipped of their cameo. But then, the veteran alternative rockers were at an unexpected point in their career. Their appearance on the show was meant, in part, to promote Up, their exploratory 11th album, released just three months prior. By the time R.E.M. filmed the segment, it was clear that Up was dead in the water. “Daysleeper,” its lovely, lilting first single, had been their first lead single not to reach the Top Ten on Billboard’s Modern Rock charts, and “Lotus,” the hardest rocking cut on the record, barely scraped both the Modern and Mainstream Rock charts.With hindsight, it’s clear that Up was a transitional record, the pivot point between R.E.M.’s reign as the biggest band in the college-rock underground and their subsequent act packing arenas. A dense, adventurous record, Up—newly reissued in an expanded 25th-anniversary edition that includes the Party of Five live recording as a second disc—seems designed to play directly to longtime fans predisposed to follow the group wherever it leads. Heavy on atmosphere and leisurely in pace, it requires close attention. Yet somehow Up wound up alienating followers enamored of R.E.M.’s jangle and chime as well as recent listeners brought aboard by the earnest introspection of Automatic for the People and overdriven fuzz of Monster.That’s quite a trick, and, in some respects, the alienation was intentional. Fresh from re-upping their contract with Warner Bros.—in the fall of 1996 they inked a deal for a reported $80 million, a staggering amount for a group that crawled out of the Athens scene of the 1980s—guitarist Peter Buck and bassist Mike Mills were eager to continue the explorations of New Adventures in Hi-Fi, the 1996 album largely recorded while touring Monster in 1995. They immediately faced a significant roadblock: At the inception of the sessions for Up, drummer Bill Berry left the band. Berry’s decision was understandable. He had suffered an onstage brain aneurysm in 1995, a health scare that prompted him to hang up his rock’n’roll shoes and retire to a farm in Georgia.Berry’s departure threw the band’s dynamics off balance. They’d long ago settled into a familiar working rhythm: Buck and Berry workshopped material in the studio prior to Mills’ arrival, and the trio would then hand over tracks to singer Michael Stipe. Buck had already been seeking new sounds, amassing old keyboards and drum machines prior to the start of the album sessions. Once recording was underway, Buck, on bass, started each day laying down tracks with drummer Barrett Martin and multi-instrumentalist Scott McCaughey, while Mills added color and textures with keyboards. Stipe suffered a massive case of writer’s block toward the end of recording, leaving the rest of the band to tinker with overdubs and mixes as they waited for the vocals. Navigating such shifts would be tricky under any circumstances, but R.E.M. also switched producers from Scott Litt, who had helmed every one of their records since 1987’s Document, to Pat McCarthy, a sympathetic collaborator who helped facilitate Buck’s experiments with electronics, achieving sounds that, while not out of step with the alternative rock of the late 1990s, were still new to R.E.M.",Rock,6.9
638,"The UK duo loosen their collars on their new remix compilation, pushing the songs on 2022’s I Love You Jennifer B to more mischievous, high-energy places. Anyone who has set foot in an academic space knows: Sometimes the brightest students are the biggest freaks. Jockstrap’s 2022 album I Love You Jennifer B was a top-of-class debut: a painstaking, high-drama pop collection with a clear command of classical songcraft and ornate glamour. Their new album, I<3UQTINVU (“I Love You Cutie, I Envy You”), compiles reworkings of those songs that the duo’s Taylor Skye created to blow off steam, fist-pumping anthems that loosen the collar on the polished originals. If Jennifer B was closing night of the big production, then I<3UQTINVU is the chaperone-free cast party: puckish, weird, and ultimately, pretty lit.On Jennifer B, Jockstrap drew as much from chamber folk and UK rave culture as they did the classic pop canon. I<3UQTINVU scrambles the formula further, zigzagging into grime, chiptune, and harder EDM. Skye recruits a few featured players, including standout South Florida artist Ian Starr on “Red Eye,” which reworks Jennifer B’s strummy curtain opener “Neon” into a brief and unhinged banger. Starr’s nightmarish snarl of “I make that boat rock” sets the tone for the big payoff—a gargled primal scream that rips the track open into a glorious conclusion of 808s and autotune.Not forgotten in the excitement is Skye’s main collaborator, vocalist and composer Georgia Ellery. Jennifer B placed her warble and knotty writing center stage in its horny baroque circus. Even broken down for parts, Ellery’s vocals are still a guiding force, maintaining a lightness that balances <3UQTINVU’s harsher edges. On songs like “Good Girl” and “I Feel,” Skye keeps key verses that preserve her songwriting, like an imagined lover’s quote from “Angst” on the latter: “You fucking love/You love to fuck/To fuck it up/Fucking listen to her sing!” And on “I Touch,” Skye leaves Ellery’s “Glasgow '' nearly intact, introducing a drum machine and looped vocals. It soars.Not every cut here earns its place. “I Noticed You” sounds like Fred Again.. mimicry with its uber-smooth vocals and monotonous house cascade, missing Jockstrap’s signature skew. Despite a fun verse from vocalist Coby Sey, the inscrutable “All Roads Lead to London''—which includes new synths, dog barks, and Rubiks-cube restructuring—just makes you miss the swooning electro-catharsis of the original, “Concrete Over Water.”Amid the band’s first-thought-best-though experimentation, a glimmer emerges. A bookending companion to I<3UQTINVU’s high-octane opener “Sexy,” “Sexy 2” reworks “50/50” into a warm lullaby, and features the album’s only new material from Ellery. Over slide guitar, banjo, strings, and shakers, she sets another beguiling scene of lust. But there’s no wink here, and none of Jennifer B’s melodramatic acrobatics: The recording is among their most intimate and unvarnished. Somewhere in the glistening runoff of Jennifer B, Skye synthesised one of Jockstrap’s loveliest tracks yet. It’s a testament to the mess on the cutting room floor as the necessary conditions for producing the next great song.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

639,"The debut album from the young pop figure transforms her jittery, emotional miniatures into songs that feel more extroverted, more joyful, and sometimes more complete. Intimacy and distance exist in a delicate balance for PinkPantheress. Since she started posting snippets and demos to TikTok in 2020, her shy club tracks have exuded warmth and tenderness, like a friend whispering secrets in your ear on the dancefloor. Her earliest singles—like “Break It Off” and “Pain”—captured the desperate yearning and the lingering pain of young love. At the time she was a teenager studying film in London, uploading music in her spare time, and naturally she kept the public at arm's length. Her songs were light on details, heavy on suggestion, and rarely stretched longer than a couple of minutes. Just when it seems like she might be willing to open up, the song ends. She’s onto another breakbeat and another thought.Heaven knows, her debut album, largely dispenses with this approach. Working with a cast of new collaborators—including pop industry staples like Greg Kurstin and producers with roots in the underground, like PC Music’s Danny L. Harle—she transforms her jittery, emotional miniatures into pop songs that feel more extroverted, more joyful, and sometimes more complete. It’s a natural step, following the success of “Boy’s a liar Pt. 2,” the pillowy, pastel-hued club cut with Ice Spice that vaulted up the Hot 100 earlier this year. That song’s prismatic production and charismatic guest appearance represented PinkPantheress pushing at the boundaries of her ambition—aiming bigger and broader than ever before. The track’s inclusion here is reflective of a general desire across Heaven knows to outrun the URL spaces she came from. Earlier this year, she said that she doesn’t use TikTok anymore, and that she’s uninterested in being an “internet artist.” She’s always had a desire to be pop in the most literal sense, the sort of songwriter, she told NPR, who makes music “your cousin or your mom” could relate to.Consequently, she returns to the palette that’s worked for her so far: synths that flicker with technicolor richness, dizzily 2-stepping drum programming, and the fragile wisps of the upper range of her voice. “Feelings,” as its title suggests, digs into her tried-and-true themes: desire, anxiety, and general uncertainty. But the song—which casts a similar nocturnal glow as early ’00s R&B—feels more fully realized, with gleaming production choices and a more emphatic vocal delivery. Throughout the record, she excises any hesitance or half steps: She embraces the fluorescent confidence of newfound stardom.PinkPantheress claims to write intuitively: Her songs were short because that’s how long she felt they needed to be. She doesn’t seem to want anyone to read into the relatively epic length of songs like “Capable of love” (three minutes and 43 seconds), but it is a notably different listening experience. Her older, miniature songs sugar-rushed through their ideas, while “Capable of love” teases out its melodies patiently, indulging tasteful repetition and turbulent dynamics that she previously wouldn’t have room for.Heaven knows flexes her abilities as a writer, producer, and curator of guest spots (Kelela and Rema’s appearances add crackling energy to “Bury me” and “Another life,” respectively). But part of what separates her from nostalgia-pop peers like piri & tommy or Yunè Pinku was a willingness to lurk in the shadows of the club, letting quiet overtones hang heavy over the tracks. Even as she extends herself as a songwriter, and as she grows more comfortable in the spotlight, she hasn’t found a way to build on the full extent of her mystique.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

640,"On his latest album, the former Cymbals Eat Guitars frontman takes an imagistic, detail-driven look at the dark corners of America. A song by Joseph D’Agostino can spin in a dozen different directions. Take “Erlking,” an early standout from his second album as Empty Country. Named after a murderous elf from European folklore, it opens with a sobering thought about the victims of Sandy Hook: “Those 20 kids should be visiting colleges.” From there, D’Agostino alludes to Calvinists sailing across the Atlantic on wooden ships, glimpses terror in a “dented metal restroom mirror,” and sarcastically imitates dudes who brush away their buddies’ assault allegations: “Forget who he molests/He’s a hell of a guy.” Locating a linear narrative is difficult, but both the song and the album that surrounds it casts a shadow of doom, best summed up by one lyric: “We’re well and truly fucked, my dear.”D’Agostino, the former Cymbals Eat Guitars frontman, started Empty Country after his arty, emo-inflected band broke up in 2017. His second album under the moniker continues the bleak imagining of America of his 2020 debut. Accompanied by one-time CEG drummer Charlotte Anne Dole and her twin brother Patrick on bass, D’Agostino tells tales of lost innocence, societal decline, and rampant violence, venturing further into the corroded recesses of this country’s past and present. Empty Country II is the purest distillation of his songwriting yet, and it could be packaged with a map: He name-checks everything from Tennessee’s Cumberland Caverns to New York City’s dreaded Port Authority Bus Terminal to the Glen Road Silver Bridge in Southwestern Connecticut. Often, the locations are the only solid ground D’Agostino offers. His tales are fictionalized, unreliably narrated, and interwoven across centuries.“Bootsie,” which veers between claustrophobic verses and anthemic choruses, tells of a young girl who takes a Greyhound from West Virginia to the “Biblically filthy” New York of the early ‘80s, finding community (but also chemical dependency) within the disco era’s drag queen culture. Closing epic “Cool S”—named after that Cool S—is sung from the perspective of a teenage murderer who is now living out his days behind bars. “FLA” traces trauma across decades in its namesake state, spiritually linked by hurricanes in 1935 and 1992. While Empty Country II can feel like a short story collection whose thematic connections become more apparent with every page turn—and indeed, D’Agostino did write a companion short story to lead single “Pearl”—ECII is more masterful as an album than a lyric booklet, invoking the depressive blues of Neil Young’s Ditch Trilogy and the sweeping, scraggly landscapes of Modest Mouse’s The Lonesome Crowded West.Whether accompanied by little more than a piano on “FLA” or guiding full-band climaxes with his falsetto on “Pearl,” D’Agostino’s adenoidal voice cuts against the grain of the music, ensuring that we hear every word. The prickly compositions stray from Empty Country’s folk and country overtones. Even on the jazzy David Berman tribute “David,” knotty solos and seedy atmospherics lurk in the background. Seek out the most uplifting lyric and you’re left with D’Agostino reflecting on Berman’s suicide: “I’m scared to die/But I’m not scared of death.” This is a dark, disheartening listen. And yet, Empty Country’s detail-driven writing shows there’s strength to be found in dredging all this up, that there’s beauty in the margins.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this review misstated the location of the Glen Road Silver Bridge.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

641,"The Australian punk musician continues his prolific streak on a fun and occasionally melancholic tribute to mid-’60s garage-pop. Jake Robertson has been in some bands: School Damage, Hierophants, Leather Towel, Modal Melodies, SWAB, to name a few. He is perhaps best known for his time in the insouciant Ausmuteants, a group from the early 2010s who garnered fans worldwide for their no-frills take on synth-punk. But the restless punk stalwart seems to have hit a particularly rich creative vein with his solo project, Alien Nosejob. Since 2017, Robertson has issued records at a breakneck pace, from the raw yet hooky classic punk of 2020’s Suddenly Everything Is Twice as Loud to the new-wave-inspired 2021’s Paint It Clear to the glam rippers on 2022’s Stained Glass. He’s got the songwriting chops to draw out what makes these vintage sounds so special, bringing vibrancy to musical ground that has been mined to near-depletion. In an interview with Still in Rock, he describes his style-hopping thusly: “Sometimes I wish I had the focus to concentrate on one sound at a time, but I don’t. I’m part of the microwave generation. I want three meals in three minutes, or I’m not eating.”Robertson’s latest, The Derivative Sounds Of... or... A Dog Always Returns to Its Vomit, plays specifically with the garage-pop sound of the mid ’60s. As is typical for him, it’s incredibly self-aware but doesn’t take itself too seriously. He may be looking backwards for inspiration, but it’s clear that the album’s title is pushing against the on-the-nose nostalgia of the ’90s and ’00s retro garage boom, which often didn’t question the regressive sexism and racism of the sound’s “trash” tropes. Instead of recreating the past, he carefully teases out the sonic details from the style that hit for maximum satisfaction, and weaves them together tightly in his own signature manner.Robertson is excellent at self-editing, and these songs are brash and bright and economical. They’re fun, with an underpinning of melancholy both teens and teens-at-heart will recognize as key to growing up in a chaotic world—which has been pop’s primary concern ever since the invention of the teenager as a discrete category. On “Act Different,” a rickety but catchy tune with a warbling, chorus-heavy guitar line, Robertson describes the simple feeling of alienation from one’s peers and how comforting it can be to retreat: “When you’re alone/You can be yourself.”Beneath the easy approachability of his music, there’s clearly careful craft at work. Opener “I’m Lost,” which rails against people caught up in their own hype, has a thrilling percussive breakdown to highlight the impact of its simple minor-key chord progression. “Ariel View” has a groovy little organ part to rival the Standells, and the lovelorn “There Was a Time I Called Her Name” features delightful psychedelic guitar flourishes. Rather than feeling like studied mimicry, these tracks have a charming lack of professionalism—Robertson’s falsetto on “There Was a Time I Called Her Name” sounds constantly on the verge of cracking—and the genuine enthusiasm of the original wave of garage rockers, kids who were simply excited to be able to pick up newly accessible electric instruments and make a racket together. Consider it home-cooked, with love.",Rock,7.3
642,"On his first studio album since 2017, Matthew Barnes details the inner mechanics of loneliness and frailty, mapping them onto lurching rhythms and agonized, alienated cries. In the 2022 supernatural horror movie Skinamarink, the camera’s distorted lens stares into complete darkness for so long that the darkness starts to take on a form all its own, roiling with what’s not there. A similar presence emerges from the holes left open in Matthew Barnes’ work as Forest Swords. His silences have depth and body to rival the figures that clatter inside them. On his new album Bolted, the UK producer details the inner mechanics of loneliness, paranoia, and frailty on the level of the beat, dreaming up a cold world where broken, snarling things have no choice but to huddle together for survival.Barnes recorded Bolted in a factory in his native Liverpool, joining legions of artists who have drawn grim inspiration from northern England’s post-industrial landscape. Like Throbbing Gristle, the industrial pathbreakers who sprang malformed from Hull nearly 50 years back, Barnes finds plenty to excavate in the physicality of percussion: the way materials slam and grind into each other, the effects the resulting sounds have on the nervous system. (His 2018 DJ-Kicks mix notably included a field recording called “Voice Memo of Piston at Manchester Museum of Science & Industry.”) Rather than sounding as if they’ve been optimized by a digital studio, his beats tend to impart the illusion of different objects crashing to the ground at varying distances. They’re loose, anxious assemblages that leave plenty of space for the ear to play in. On Bolted, they cohere less than they ever have on a Forest Swords record, leaving dance music’s standard rhythmic logic to fray in the wind.On lead single “Butterfly Effect,” a scraping, asymmetrical beat skitters beneath a vocal from Neneh Cherry. Barnes composed the drum pattern in the wake of a leg injury, and he has described the process of piecing it together as “some kind of attempt to cope with the psychedelic amounts of pain I was in.” The beat’s jittery, deformed locomotion neatly impresses the idea of a body thrown out of equilibrium, shuddering its way through physical suffering. The bold metallic cacophonies of “The Low” and “Rubble” similarly probe at the idea of the body as a lurching machine, and at the chaos that unfurls at the points where it starts to break.One especially evocative technique in the Forest Swords toolbox is the tight crop on an impassioned vocal sample. Barnes likes to pinpoint the most urgent moment in a singer’s performance, then sever it from its surrounding context: no intake of breath, no resolution, no language, just assonance. On “End,” a displaced voice duets with a dusty woodwind sample; it sounds desperate to be understood, but all the syllables pour out scrambled. This mutilated utterance is lonelier than silence. Someone’s out there, but you can’t understand them; there’s distance between you that can’t be closed.",Experimental,7.5
643,"Drawing on samples of nature and science recordings, the experimental duo crafts a motley, riotous album from the Folkways Records archive. When Moses Asch founded Folkways Records in 1948, he set out to create a repository of all the sounds of the world—folk music and protest music and indigenous music and jazz, but also sounds of the office, of the junkyard, of the bottle-nose dolphin. “I decided that I would become like an encyclopedia,” he declared. “You don’t eliminate ‘A’ because nobody buys ‘A,’ but keep ‘B’ because ‘B’ is popular.” Asch promised that not a single title would go out of print, an offer that attracted educators, scientists, and activists who prized longevity above mass appeal. The result is one of the most remarkable audio archives ever created: Across 40 years, Asch released nearly 2,200 albums, an average of one per week. After his death in 1986, the Smithsonian Institution acquired the Folkways archive and stored it in a climate-controlled fireproof vault. Any title can now be replicated on demand by a CD-producing “Moe-bot,” an ultra-modern solution that realizes Asch’s promise beyond his wildest imaginings.Croaking Frogs, Buzzing Hornets, Squealing Dolphins: A Guide to Smithsonian Folkways’ Best Science and Nature RecordingsTo celebrate Folkways’ 75th anniversary, the Smithsonian invited Baltimore sound-wranglers Matmos to record an original album that would sample this vast catalog. Drew Daniel and M.C. Schmidt, a duo as likely to find inspiration in a Whirlpool washing machine as in the work of Polish composer Bogusław Schaeffer, were especially drawn to records from the 1950s and ’60s, the era when portable equipment first made it easy to record everything from toads to time clocks. Matmos came back with a counteroffer: The album would feature no original music, only samples; and those samples would come exclusively from these early nature and science recordings. Return to Archive is the motley, riotous result, a suitably retrofuturistic collage incorporating over two dozen records ranging from Sounds of Animals to Sounds of Medicine, International Morse Code to End the Cigarette Habit Through Self Hypnosis.Daniel and Schmidt let the archive guide them. Some sounds play nicely together, as in the dozens of snippets on opener “Good Morning Electronics,” finely diced and snapped to an eighth-note grid to create a whirlwind tour of jungles, laboratories, and sci-fi worlds. Others, like the mud-dauber wasp in its eponymous track, demand space to themselves. Matmos work up an entire band from the buzz of the insect’s flight, sculpting bass, percussion, and distorted electronics through careful sampling, processing, and sequencing. It’s an impressive performance even if it lacks the novelty of the group’s previous tracks crafted from crayfish synapses and cow uteri.",Experimental,7.4
644,"The Danish musician’s vibrant, uncanny new album gives alt-rock a hyperreal gleam. On her debut album, Skinned, ML Buch framed wry observations about modern life in futuristic, subtly off-kilter electronic pop. She was touching screens, mulling over online obsessions, contemplating the nexus of technology and desire. Her new album, Suntub, focuses on more abstract and corporeal themes—onomatopoeic words, “strange curves,” elemental forms like sun and sea and wind—teeming with the nitid detail of a Gregory Crewdson tableau. More than anything, Buch seems consumed with the mysteries of biology and the mazelike dimensions of human viscera. “Can I melt in algal bloom/Leak from bladder flower wombs,” she asks on “Solid,” stacking vocal harmonies over neo-grunge guitar. Across three different songs, she sings, respectively, of “flesh on air,” a “fleshless hand,” and a “flesh rag” in a “flesh bag.”Accompanying this shift from URL to IRL, Skinned’s overtly electronic elements—vaporwave synths, atmospheric sound design, Auto-Tuned choruses—have largely disappeared, replaced by sparkling guitars, frictionless rock drumming, and vocal melodies rendered with airbrushed clarity. Buch leans further into emulating the “dad rock” of blockbuster acts like Dire Straits and the Police: Traces of Roxy Music’s DNA are evident in the chromium glow of her guitar tone, along with the fuzz of shoegaze and the crunch of ’90s indie. She even indulges in a little ersatz vinyl scratching. But more often than not, the reference points feel like a copy of a copy of a copy, emulated so many times that the original inspiration is impossible to identify, leaving only a vague feeling of deja vu.To create her striking, ultra-vibrant sound—steeped in alt-rock naturalism yet wearing an uncanny sheen—Buch used a number of unusual techniques, including seven-stringed and fretless guitars. She apparently recorded her vocals inside her car, and reamped her instruments through spaces like a swimming pool and a wood-paneled sauna, but her production doesn’t offer a tangible sense of physical space: In an odd twist, it offers the suggestion of a virtual world, something conjured up entirely within the confines of her computer. There’s not a hair out of place in these immaculately polished assemblages. They’re almost too flawless—the lines unnaturally sharp, the colors unnaturally vivid, the rhythms as steady as HDTV with motion smoothing turned on. Yet that hyperreal gleam is also what gives them their magnetism.Nowhere is the album’s curious airlessness more palpable than in Buch’s vocals. They sound weirdly placeless, perhaps even sourceless—smooth, free of vibrato, soft yet not quite breathy. But where such tactics might have been used to create a distancing effect, Buch’s unblemished tone and intuitive melodic turns never sound arch, affected, or ironic. Her tone may be cool, but her music is bathed in a warm, radiant glow. A similar paradox characterizes the album itself, which swaps the artificial veneer of Skinned for a deeper and more mysterious form of artifice. Outwardly, Suntub is so glossy that it suggests a kind of normcore, a pastiche of gentle alt-rock. Below the surface, however, Buch’s strange curves and fleshless hands point in a far more cryptic direction.",Electronic,8.0
645,"The Broken Social Scene frontman confronts loss, survival, and addiction on a set of brooding dispatches from middle age. Every album anniversary tour is also about the march towards death. Ben Gibbard is no longer the baby-faced up-and-comer who made Transatlanticism and Liz Phair is no longer the romantically frustrated 25-year-old who made Exile in Guyville, but they’re still bringing these milestone albums on tour, inviting us to reflect on how they’ve changed and we’ve changed and everything’s decayed in the years since we first heard them. We’re all getting closer to the grave, but at least “Fuck and Run” still bangs.Kevin Drew, of Broken Social Scene fame, has spent the past year negotiating the same nostalgic mindfuck, performing 2002’s You Forgot It in People in full to audiences for whom “Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old Girl” and “Lover’s Spit” were as formative as Sgt. Pepper’s. If that record’s 20th trip around the sun made you feel old, how do you think Drew feels? Now, after revisiting the creative output of his twenties, he returns to the unsettled present on a short, grayscale solo record that’s literally titled Aging.If Drew’s 2007 debut, Spirit If…, was a solo album in name only—billed as “Broken Social Scene Presents,” with swelling arrangements featuring many of Drew’s bandmates—Aging is the real thing. Shorn of the communal spirit that courses through BSS’s records, these are brooding, synth-heavy dispatches from middle age. “My skin is cold/I’m not aging right,” the 47-year-old croons on “Awful Lightning,” a six-minute centerpiece that wrings slow-burning drama from Hauschka-like piano arpeggios.Drew has long excelled at writing emotionally resonant songs even when you don’t have a clue what he’s singing about. (SongMeanings.com commenters will crack “Shampoo Suicide” as soon as the cops find Jimmy Hoffa’s body.) But Aging was written as Drew grappled with the loss of friends and mentors, and death has a way of nudging songwriters towards the blunt and direct. At times, it’s disarming to hear him singing to us so plainly about his troubles.On the burbling, melancholy “Elevators,” his deepening baritone sounds uncannily like Matt Berninger as he puts a cosmic spin on grief: “Elevator please change your name/Because they’re coming for me tonight/And my friend died.” “Party Oven” summons the nocturnal musings of a guy wondering if a lifetime of debauchery was all worth it. The stirring song captures a lot of feeling in few words; when Drew sings, “We partied into your grave/Was that okay?” you can detect grief and guilt mingling together.",Experimental,6.5
646,"On her first album in a decade, the New York guitarist returns to her pyrotechnic displays of virtuosity. The pace is fast, the tone raw, the mood appropriately triumphant. In the decade since her last LP, New York City lifer Marnie Stern stepped back from her solo career at the edge of math rock to focus on domestic life. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, she was at the forefront of the new millennium’s wave of noisy, kinetic rock acts, showing off a gymnast’s flexibility on a string of high-energy records. In a twist on a day job, Stern has spent much of the last 10 years playing guitar in Seth Meyers’ late-night backing band—a gig more conducive to raising kids than the interminable grind of touring. But, she says, she never lost sight of the guitar as a “blank canvas.”Marnie Stern Still ShredsStern reclaims her place among the era’s most commanding guitarists on her polished fifth LP, The Comeback Kid, a densely packed showcase of her distinctive style. The latest set is noisy at the core and fuzzy at the edges, heavy on fingertapping and busy melodic displays that snap together elements of punk, grunge, and surf rock. Re-sharpening the rounded edges that shaped much of 2013’s The Chronicles of Marnia, Stern flaunts a reinvigorated spirit in searing songs that live up to the playfully celebratory mood she establishes in the album’s title.In press materials, Stern described making the new LP as an exercise in learning to “start being myself again.” Any time she wondered whether a choice was too strange, she’d remind herself that this was her project: “I’m allowed to do whatever I want!” In that spirit, “Plain Speak” opens the album with bright, bristly, major-key riffs that she tempers with layered vocal harmonies. “I can’t keep on moving backwards,” she barks, standing firm at the center of the song’s dizzying tilt-a-whirl spin.She leans further into her idiosyncrasies on “Believing Is Seeing,” unleashing a creepy, almost cartoonish cry—“This place is cold! I can’t hear you!”—over icy ostinato guitar before stepping sideways into a series of riff-heavy passages. “What if I add this? And this?” she asks as she heaps layers of guitar onto the mix, playing up the self-referential humor. The churning energy of “The Natural” and the short bursts of “Oh Are They” both channel classic elements of ’80s and ’90s underground rock; her repeated yelps have the feeling of a rallying cry.Like the oaky notes of aged bourbon, the particulars of Stern’s technique have only gotten richer since The Chronicles of Marnia. Her dives feel more dramatic, as when she approaches power-metal poses in “Forward” or shreds up a storm in “Working Memory,” and she reaches piercing vocal highs that land between a ’70s psychedelic shriek and a winged mythical beast. Drummer Jeremy Hara is Stern’s reliable companion throughout, complementing her breakneck fretwork with powerful percussive blasts.",Experimental,8.0
647,"The Brockhampton leader embraces a grungy, guitar-centric new sound on his first solo album since the dissolution of his rap collective. For some Brockhampton fans, the band’s farewell album felt like a fakeout, if not a betrayal. The form-breaking rap collective’s previous full lengths had been defined by both their abundance and their communal spirit—each was an unruly pileup of voices, personalities, and perspectives. But the group’s 2022 curtain call, The Family, released seven months after they announced their indefinite hiatus at Coachella, turned out to be less an actual Brockhampton album than a Kevin Abstract solo album about Brockhampton, with the project’s founder ruminating on the group in their absence. It was a fundamental contradiction: a one-sided Brockhampton record.If The Family was Abstract’s eulogy for Brockhampton, his new solo album, Blanket, is his fresh start. In September, Abstract debuted this material at a short-notice live show in Hollywood, with a band that played up the heavy, grungy direction of this new material, all brooding fuzz, dropped tunings, and loud/soft whiplash. Abstract has flirted with rock music before, both with Brockhampton and on solo albums like 2016’s American Boyfriend, yet Blanket commits so completely that it feels like a true makeover. Where modernist rappers like Kenny Mason and Jim Legxacy dabble in guitars as part of a wider, rotating menu of styles, on Blanket, Abstract embraces them to the near total exclusion of rap.It isn’t always a natural fit. With his whispery lower register, Abstract isn’t much of a rock singer, and he’s not much of a screamer either (his “woos!” on the title track are unsure and truncated, like a basketball fan realizing mid-yelp he’s cheering for the wrong team’s dunk). And too often he mistakes rawness for inspiration. Opener “When the Rope Post 2 Break” aims for Nirvana but plays more like a half-finished demo. Abstract pounded out the record relatively quickly, over just a few months, and he doesn’t disguise when he’s winging it.What Abstract does bring to the table, though, is an ear for sticky, misshapen melodies and a rap producer’s sense of pacing, which keeps Blanket moving so briskly that its periodic clumsiness doesn’t bog it down much. When he sweetens the nervier edges of ’90s alternative with a strong shot of R&B, the results can be sublime: “Scream” charts an unlikely middle ground between Blonde and Surfer Rosa, while “Voyager” conjures the blistering passion of a Prince rock ballad. As heavy as the album can be, with its raw-nerved surveys of alienation and rejection, Abstract knows when to lighten the mood. Whenever Blanket threatens to succumb to wallowing, he breaks things up with a peppy, Mac DeMarco/Alex G-style indie-rock tune like “Running Out” or “What Should I Do.” By the record’s final stretch, much of its initial angst has burned off, freeing Abstract to indulge the sweeter, poppier styles that come to him more naturally. On the exuberant “Real 2 Me,” he pines for a crush with puppy-dog longing (“When you signed my cast, I wish I broke both arms,” he gushes).For the closer “My Friend,” featuring some understated vocal accompaniments from indie breakouts MJ Lenderman and Kara Jackson, Abstract captures the more painful flip side of infatuation, dwelling on the sting of unrequited romantic feelings. With its acoustic guitars and wistful twang, the track is Abstract’s biggest sonic departure yet from Brockhampton. Yet in another sense, it’s the song that feels most of a piece with his old group, simply by the presence of other voices. That’s the challenge that looms over his solo career: As compelling as Abstract can be on his own, he still sounds best when he has some company.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

648,"The new album from pop balladeer Jilian Medford unwinds the emotional pressure, leaning into high-adrenaline hooks and poignant moments of self-reflection. Ian Sweet’s new album, Sucker, opens with mortal fear. “What if I die?” Jilian Medford wonders; after a piano chord rings out for a moment, she continues: She’s afraid she’ll pass “with this song in my head,” that she’ll “never get to sing it.” Medford is no stranger to high-stakes songwriting: She wrote most of 2021’s ambitious and emotionally rich Show Me How You Disappear after spending two months in an intensive outpatient mental health program. Writing that record, Medford Rolling Stone, was a process of “sifting through the weeds, grasping onto things, like, ‘I hope this lyric will help me literally to survive.’”But despite its opening lines, Sucker doesn’t reprise that make-or-break intensity. Instead, Medford dials down the pressure, turning her attention to more mundane crises: letting herself fall for someone who will probably break her heart; the quiet aftermath of a breakup; cutting her bangs even though she swore she wouldn’t. Retaining her commitment to emotional transparency, she leans into high-adrenaline hooks and poignant self-reflection with confidence and grit.Medford produced the record alongside Alex Craig and Strange Ranger’s Isaac Eiger, working at an artists’ residency at the Outlier Inn, a Catskill Mountains establishment where 24-hour studio access offered them space for experimentation and spontaneity. The songs are tightly constructed, but don’t feel buttoned-up; even when they deal with bruising emotions, there’s a current of lightheartedness and fun. The propulsive and fuzzy “Your Spit” reflects on the doubt that accompanies new relationships, but it’s also just about the thrill of making out. Her voice, which starts near a whisper, becomes a shriek of joy when the big synths kick in.“Emergency Contact” and “Sucker,” with their shoegaze guitars and catchy hooks, are a deft synthesis of Ian Sweet’s indie rock beginnings and Medford’s playful pop instincts. Across the album, she tweaks a classic quiet-loud recipe just enough that songs like “Smoking Again” and “Your Spit,” with all their swerves and eruptions, feel like joyrides. Towards the back half, that catharsis can verge on predictable, but smart production flourishes—the creaky synth line on “Clean,” the corroded climax of “Hard”—continually push the music into stranger, more inventive territory.Medford grounds her lyrics in memorable, off-kilter specificity: the melodic hum of power lines during a long drive, the salty taste of a kiss, an ex who always misspelled her name (“Two Ls when there’s only one/And a G instead of a J”). She takes herself to task, copping to mistakes with a self-deprecating wink. “I run my mouth/Like I run away/From everything,” she sings on the understated “Comeback.” When romantic trouble arises, she’ll say she had it coming. “I’m a sucker for the pain/And heartbreak,” she admits on the title track. If Show Me How You Disappear was a testament to perseverance and self-reliance in tremendously challenging times, Sucker is evidence that those skills still enrich us even when circumstances aren’t so dire. There’s palpable joy in the songs’ anthemic structures and Medford’s bright, confident delivery, even though there are reminders that this self-awareness was hard-won. Medford makes the crying and bleeding sound fortifying nonetheless. “It’s just a cut,” she sings on “Clean,” “and baby, I’m tough.”All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

649,"The Australian psychonauts embark on a two-part mythological synth odyssey. It’s one of their wackiest and most uninhibited records to date. In 2013, Giorgio Moroder sat down to give Daft Punk some advice. “Once you free your mind about a concept of harmony and of music being correct, you can do whatever you want,” he monologues on “Giorgio by Moroder.” Consider King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard enlightened: They’ve abided by that method for their entire career, yielding microtonal trilogies, thrash metal climate criticism, and occult-themed hip-hop. If you’ve ever wondered Have King Gizzard made a song like this?, chances are they have.Inspired by Moroder’s free-spirited approach, the Australian sextet presents The Silver Cord, a synth-based improvisational odyssey that retells ancient mythologies. In an echo of the extended remixes Moroder created for stars like Donna Summer and Blondie, the album appears in two forms, one that runs about 30 minutes and the other stretched as thin as possible into 90 minutes. Skeptics might ask why; the band would probably answer, “Why not?” Even 25 albums in, it’s one of their wackiest and most uninhibited records to date.The 30-minute mix is clearly the more approachable. Twinkling opener “Theia” might trick you into believing The Silver Cord resembles Butterfly 3000, the mid-pandemic Gizz album that sought to escape into a world of lush synth loops. Closer inspection reveals the new album is more like an electrified sibling of Ice, Death, Planets, Lungs, Mushrooms and Lava, whose mellow, free-flowing songs emerged from open-ended improvisational jam sessions. Though the band has traded guitars, drums, and bass for Rolands, Junos, and Moogs, you can hear familiar techniques, like Michael Cavanagh’s breakneck synth drum fills on “Chang’e” and Stu Mackenzie’s throaty growls on “Gilgamesh.”The extended mix is where the band really runs wild, creating elaborate imaginings of mythological worlds. It feels most organic on the brighter tracks, like the chameleonic “Theia” (now pushed to 20 minutes), the head-bobbing “Set,” and the celestial “Chang’e.” Named for the Chinese deity who escaped to the moon, “Chang’e” is dreamy and invigorating, with synths that oscillate like waves. In the second half, the tempo rises and the synths pitch up, rocketing to the exosphere; then just when the song threatens to burst, it opens onto a new expanse, as if landing on the lunar surface. The brooding 11-minute version of “Gilgamesh,” on the other hand, drags on with little purpose except to challenge your attention span, and the chants of “Gila! Gila!” feel out of place amid the digital pulses.",Rock,7.1
650,"On its second album of 2023, the London trio looks to enliven its bookish, deadpan indie rock formula. Three years ago, when London trio Bar Italia emerged as signees to Dean Blunt’s mysterious World Music label, they curried niche intrigue among devotees ravaged by their foggy mystique. The world is much bigger, though, which meant that the music needed to be convincing enough to transcend online chatter—troubling, perhaps, for a group whose shadowy aesthetics tended to bleed into just-as-shadowy songs. Over the murky first months of their existence, two interpretations of Bar Italia’s sound seemed apt: tongue-in-cheek provocation akin to their World Music peers, or earnest slacker rock that only felt vapid because you weren’t listening for the right things.During their initial stint with World Music, the group released Quarrel and bedhead, a one-two punch of LPs whose stark arrangements and compact lengths left people wanting more. Earlier this year, they signed to indie powerhouse Matador. Tracey Denim, their first album for the label, took tangible steps towards establishing an identity, as opposed to languidly tip-toeing around one. They were honing a sound—a deadpan, cut-and-dried effort shared between (very) amateur vocalists and lightly fuzzed guitars—that left a blurry trace of larger ambitions. Not only could they stand alone, but they were also willing to give it a try that lasted longer than 20 minutes.Five months later, they’re back with The Twits, an attempt to expand on a tried-and-true formula. It’s bookish, looking-out-the-window music: foot-tappy and slightly unnerving, best consumed through faulty earbuds you have to hold at precisely the right angle to operate. The group echoes the same moody UK rock influences they always have (The Cure, Slowdive), but with a willingness to experiment that suggests they’ve grown bored of mere imitation. The result is a slackish near-hour of aspirant dorm-room rock, augmented with nerdy undertones and a teeny—dare I say too teeny—pep in their step. “You don’t realize it, hardly recognize it,” their voices tease in the record’s final minute, disembodied shouts riding eerie guitar feedback. It sounds like what the Shining twins might create with secondhand Stratocasters in a makeshift studio at the Overlook Hotel: music so unsettling, and so serpentine, that it almost feels as if it’s laughing at us.This is still pretty angsty stuff, and per usual, the group favors themes of isolation and jilted romance. For all its crypticism, Bar Italia’s early music was rife with coming-of-age signifiers—breakup mantras, pleas for escapism, and fledgling musicality to represent fledgling adulthood. On The Twits, they sound refreshingly ready to add color where they once left tracks barren. “worlds greatest emoter,” which packs arena-sized riffage into a pint container, feels surprisingly danceable, as opposed to the pensive half-sway the group’s output usually encourages. The other singles are strong, too: Where they used to fester in heartbreak, a steely new determinism peeks through the cracks. “Keep playing with my receiving hand,” Nina Cristante goads in “my little tony,” “’Cause you know you lost the game.”",Rock,6.9
651,"The Andalusian singer’s debut brushes electronic beats and R&B melodies over a flamenco canvas. It is a masterful meditation on ancestral struggle that looks back to find a way forward. Growing up in the sierra of Andalusia, María José Llergo gained an education in the musical discipline of flamenco, surrounded by the community and spirituality of the people who helped create it. Her skill and technique are exceptional, evidence of her classical training at the Catalonia School of Music, which she attended after leaving her hometown of Pozoblanco. While flamenco is known for being technically complex and often mythologized under the domain of lone icons, in the lyrics and the expansive atmospheres Llergo crafts, she honors the genre’s heart. The folkloric style was consolidated in the region of Andalusia, and it has served as a vehicle for Romani migrants who have faced rampant discrimination in Spain to voice their struggles.That resilient ethos appears in Llergo’s own Romani heritage and Andalusian upbringing, a vital component of the music that is too often lost in the flamenco that becomes most commercially successful outside of Spain. Her vision, this time with a more explicitly experimental bent toward electronic music and R&B, succeeds because it builds from this context instead of shedding it. Llergo’s full-length debut Ultrabelleza, which translates to “ultra-beauty,” reflects a lyrical and musical command of the form that many spend decades trying to understand—and emulate.Her first project, the 2020 EP Sanación (Spanish for “healing”), launched her as an avant force in the genre. Her commitment to the practice of healing is present in every element of the writing here. Lyrics feature recurring motifs of flying, wind, and water—symbols of purification and liberating movement. But these lofty images are grounded in discussion of the struggles with poverty and discrimination that she’s faced in her life. She lingers in propulsive beats and extended, reflective melismas, as if the music itself is an exercise in repair.The album opens with a prayer to her grandmother played on a cassette; the sound of it loading into a tape deck transforms sublimely into the clatter of feet on the ground, a traditional zapateo that introduces the following track, “Aprendiendo a Volar.” On “La Puerta Está Abierta,” she sings of a childhood grief that may be difficult to remember or recognize. Singing is the portal from then to now: “Cuando se abra la puerta, cuando se alce mi voz/El aire cruza la sierra de esta habitación.” (“When the door opens, when I raise my voice/The air crosses the sierra, from this room.”) On the standout “Superpoder,” she visualizes flying over overdue bills and neighborhood whispers that she’s “broken,” finding strength in the music that sustained her. She sings, “Aprendí a llorar cantando/Aprendí a cantar llorando.” (“I learned to cry while singing/I learned to sing while crying.”) At times, her warm voice literally reverberates against sleek drum machines and string sections, blending the timelines of past and present. As heavy as these introductory tracks are—they each feature a ghostly Hammond organ, which disappears as the album builds in intensity—they encapsulate the hope that exists on the other side. For Llergo, singing offers an opportunity to bear witness to healing in all of its incarnations.",Pop,7.9
652,"The Baltimore rapper helps the superproducer loosen up on their new collaborative album, a follow-up to 2021’s Memory Lane. Shordie Shordie is a rapper comfortable playing both casanova and jilted ex, sometimes in the same song. He got his start as the hook man for Baltimore rap trio Peso Da Mafia, turning tracks like “Money Man” and “About Us” into anthems for the hustlers and romantically downtrodden. As a solo artist, Shordie has leaned more aggressively on the romantic side of things, delivering dispatches from the nebulous corners of situationships like a raspier version of fellow DMV vocalist Brent Faiyaz. Chameleonic Canadian producer Murda Beatz was a periodically interesting foil for Shordie on their first collaborative album, 2021’s Memory Lane, but his beats often blended into the background. This year’s Memory Lane 2 is like a DLC pack for the first project, tweaking the muted sound of the original and more fluidly displaying Shordie and Murda’s chemistry.As a producer, Murda Beatz is a jack of all trades who can come across bland, a type-beat producer watering down distinct regional flavors. The Memory Lane projects stick to the guitar melodies and 808s that typify Shordie’s catalog. Roughly two-thirds of Memory Lane 2’s production is string-based; most of it is serviceable, but some songs have more personality and finesse than usual. Early highlight “Me Too” features skittering hi-hats that play double-dutch with guitar strums and Shordie’s lively hums. “A Nice Time” teases out a flamenco shuffle, turning a tale of interstate love into a nervy and seductive dance.Shordie has always been the animating force behind his and Murda Beatz’ best songs, his melodies, stories, and trademark “ayeee-yeah-yeah” adlib bursting with color. Only he could croak-sing to a woman about having sex with her sister, like he does on the hook for “Drink,” and make himself sound more endearing. Flow-wise, he’s dexterous and unpredictable. “Ride With Shordie Pt. 2” chronicles a drug deal, party, and anxiety-riddled drive with a girlfriend over the course of a night; Shordie brings it to life with a rat-a-tat delivery at the start, then raps verses seemingly in one gulp of breath. His voice can communicate fear (“First Kiss”), excitement (“Sin City”), and regret (“Farmers Market”) effortlessly.Memory Lane 2 really revs up in moments where Shordie and Murda Beatz go offscript. “WYO” turns the cliche sidepiece narrative into a dialogue, with guest BlakeIANA just as down to creep as Shordie is: “I’m so P, won't tell your bitch, but I might put it in my song.” “Don’t Forget Me” dwells on a drug-fueled fling over a jaunty hyphy beat, the melancholy lyrics contrasting with the peppy atmosphere. You can tell Shordie and Murda are getting more comfortable around each other, figuring out how to turn foibles into ear candy.Whether he’s dodging enemies or linking with a new lady for the night, Shordie is constantly grappling with several things simultaneously. If he’s with one girl, he’s thinking about another; if one drug trade or shootout ends with him alive, he’s occupied with a different one that almost went south. There’s tension and unease in even his most relaxed songs, and that multifaceted approach seems to be rubbing off on Murda Beatz. The production, though still mostly leaning on reliable tropes, is a little more challenging and curious than before. More collabs together might be what it takes to get Murda Beatz to fully loosen up.",Rap,6.9
653,"In a minimalist piece presented in four different iterations—for strings, woodwinds, brass and organ, and choir and electronics—the Los Angeles composer strips her music down to its bones. The first few notes of “Long Gradus (strings)” are so fragile that they might break at any moment. Each member of string quartet Quatuor Bozzini bows one long tone without any vibrato or other ornamentation, stretching it out until it becomes paper thin. It’s like a skeleton of a Sarah Davachi piece—just the notes, none of the reverb. To write Long Gradus, the Los Angeles-based composer draws on many of the ideas that have shaped her work over the years—slow tempos, just intonation, harmonies inspired by Medieval and Renaissance polyphony. But where her previous albums felt cavernous, Long Gradus strips her music down to its bones, zeroing in on the timbre of each individual note.Davachi composed Long Gradus while she was in residence at Quatuor Bozzini’s Composers’ Kitchen. The artists worked closely together to develop the piece, which explores psychoacoustics—the science of sound and perception—through sustained tones. It is composed of four movements, each between 15 and 17 minutes long, that progress through a series of intervals, tracking their evolution in time. Intended as an open-ended work, Long Gradus offers guidelines but no strict rules, so it may be played by any group of four instruments.In the album version, Davachi shows the composition’s adaptability by presenting recordings of string quartet, woodwinds, brass and organ, and choir and electronics, demonstrating how the piece translates across instrumentations. Davachi has never shied away from writing long pieces—her albums often run an hour or more—but Long Gradus takes her work to a new extreme. Its four discs spread out over four and a half hours, examining the contours of the work from seemingly every angle.Throughout, tones enter and fade with the ease of breathing. Each movement creeps from low to high pitches almost unnoticeably, save for some occasional clashes between frequencies, and ample pauses between notes give the music a glacial quality. Davachi has always explored measured, subtle motion: Her stretched-out progressions often seem to exist outside of time, moving at a pace that’s guided by intuition. But that’s a zoomed-out picture, and Long Gradus shows the granular: With this composition, Davachi invites us to take stock of every tone in the minutest detail.The four iterations take on strikingly different qualities. When notes get close together in the string quartet version, there’s pronounced beating; when woodwinds play, there are soaring overtones. The strings often sound ghostly, while the woodwinds are bright and feathery; organ and brass feel deep and resonant while choir and electronics take on a Medieval air. Those changes are so subtle that listening to each feels repetitive—this is the same piece, after all, just played by a different set of tools. But the four versions of Long Gradus do show how the work transcends the particularities of a given adaptation. No matter the instrumentation, Davachi’s music is still evolving.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

654,"On his wily, restless new album as Actress, Darren Cunningham expands the canvas to make room for private jokes, stray thoughts, and cryptic musings. The human voice does not survive for long in the vacuum of Actress’ music; it is cut up, spaghettified, dissolved into fog and smoke. Demonic pitch-shifted voices cackle, howl, and recede into the murk. Sampled divas morph into distant ambulance sirens. All the while, Darren Cunningham carries on an arch, amused, perma-blazed commentary; one imagines him as Rod Serling or Vincent Price, inviting the enterprising listener to follow him into a world where reality cannot be trusted. His catchphrases and cryptic murmurings are often the only thing connecting the listener to the human world, the only reminder that there’s actually a producer behind all of this and that you’re not just listening to an ill wind blowing from Tartarus.Cunningham’s new album LXXXVIII was inspired by chess—the idle pastime of a steel-trap mind. There are some remarkably idle stretches on this 57-minute album, which weaves between short dance tracks and long, intractable expanses of stasis; it’s the inverse of the typical techno “artist album,” where the dance tracks are sandwiched between half-baked ambient stocking-stuffers designed to show off the producer’s compositional bona fides. Many of the dance tracks on LXXXVIII seem vestigial or underdeveloped; “Oway (f 7 )” is a stark, haunted-sounding loop that never builds to anything, and “Pluto (a 2) ” cuts off abruptly after less than three minutes. You get the sense that yawning voids like “Green Blue Amnesia Magic Haze ( d 7 )” and “Azifiziks ( d 8 )” are the real heart of the record, that if you peer into their depths for long enough you might decode some of the byzantine logic that drives this music—or maybe you’re just staring at a black hole.LXXXVIII is the Roman numeral for 88. That was the name of a comparatively spry album Cunningham released relatively under the radar in 2020, now packaged with the 3xLP edition of the new record. It is also the number of keys on a piano, and Cunningham uses that instrument as a means to transform his music into a sort of free jazz. “M2 ( f 8 )” starts out as the kind of slight, nacreous keyboard sketch Ryuichi Sakamoto might’ve cranked out between appointments before it’s subsumed into a loping, side-chained rhythm. “Push Power ( a 1 )” kicks off the record with a deranged hyena cackle, after which an imperious voice recites robotic commands and Cunningham ruminates endlessly on a circular piano phrase. It scans as a joke on the first listen, a challenge on the second, and something really quite beautiful on the third; just wait for the voice that bubbles up at the end and seems to sing, “Cry.”",Electronic,7.4
655,"On its first album in 30 years, the Boston shoegaze band looks back with tenderness. Drop Nineteens were five private-college kids in Boston, equally enthralled by arena-scale post-punk and the new sounds of shoegaze. Though surrounded by a thriving underground scene and no shortage of venues, they were more interested in recording than gigging. In dorms and basements all over Boston University, they poured rough dream-pop into a rented eight-track console, mailing the resulting demo to the only place that made sense: England. The gambit succeeded. Melody Maker awarded them Single of the Week, and labels started phoning. By the time 1992’s Delaware was released, Drop Nineteens still hadn’t played a hometown show, an order of operations that rankled their peers. (A contemporary zine featured the band on the cover with the headline “Sick of Them Yet?”)No matter: The UK music press loved these American kids punching holes in shoegaze’s narcotic cocoon. They opened for Blur. Radiohead opened for them. But the tour life was rough on a group so young (“We’re sort of the Kris Kross of indie rock,” lead singer Greg Ackell quipped at the time), and Drop Nineteens lost three members before starting work on the next album. Ackell and bassist Steve Zimmerman found replacements for 1993’s shoegaze-free, crisply acidic National Coma, which had its moments but nothing as autumnally assured as Delaware’s single “Winona.” By 1995, the band was done.Thirty years after their unintended swan song, Drop Nineteens return with Hard Light. Ackell and Zimmerman are rejoined by founding guitarist/singer Paula Kelley and lead guitarist Motohiro Yasue; National Coma-era drummer Pete Koeplin rounds out the quintet. With so much time gone, it would have been no surprise if Drop Nineteens had rehashed musical glories, or settled old scores. But when Hard Light does look backwards, it does so without triumph or disillusion, only tenderness.Ackell turns a telescope on the distant glow of youth—in all its peacocking, dumbass splendor—and finds warmth. Everywhere you look, there’s an escapade: driving to a gig in a snowstorm, strutting your new boots into the club, skidding out on a stick shift. “Stepped into a cage/Woke up in Berlin,” Ackell marvels on “Gal,” as the reverb burns off like fog. The icy, Kelley-led “The Price Was High” reads like a cryptic retelling of their transatlantic breakout: “The nights from days/Ferried east and ended with no one/Getting wise.” Guitars howl over a high-stepping rhythm section, like a blizzard barreling into a Soviet disco.",Rock,7.4
656,"Mexico City collaborators Mabe Fratti, Camille Mandoki, Gibrana Cervantes, and Concepción Huerta conjure up fluid, freeform chamber improv that feels like the product of a collective mind. The music of Mexico City-based collective Amor Muere stretches between dream states and the waking world. The group—comprising cellist and songwriter Mabe Fratti, singer and sound artist Camille Mandoki, violinist Gibrana Cervantes, and electronic musician and tape manipulator Concepción Huerta—built their project on a foundation of friendship and creative collaboration. The four women have been performing live within the local scene for years, sitting in on each other’s sets and participating in a larger-scale multidisciplinary piece written and directed by Mandoki. As Amor Muere (translation: “Love Dies”), they seek free expression within a democratic setting. On their debut album, a time to love, a time to die, they tap into the reaches of their conjoined minds and extract avant-garde compositions grafted from gritty electronic textures, discordant strings, and soaring vocal melodies. Even in their most abstract sketches, each musician retains a distinct fingerprint. But their work also seems hewn by a single set of hands.To create their debut, Amor Muere expanded and refined material developed over multiple jam sessions in recent years. Some songs highlight the dynamics of texture and silence: The wordless “Shhhhh” captures a frantic, creaking conversation between Fratti’s cello and Cervantes’ violin. The dialogue is sparse at first, but whips into a tangled frenzy as Huerta and Mandoki goad the string players with digital blasts and distorted washes of synthesizer. Fratti sings the lead vocal on “LA,” a sun-dappled counterpart to the moody “Shhhhh” that tracks the interplay between bowed strings and electronic atmospheres. Her tone is mottled but reflective, like slightly smudged glass. “Suave aire sobre la cabeza/Sabe a dónde llegar” (“Soft air over our heads/Knows where to arrive”), she sings. Measuring the impulse of a breeze that drifts naturally yet with seeming purpose, Fratti’s lyrics—steeped in dream logic—might be an ode to improvisation itself.“LA” shares DNA with Vidrio, a new album Fratti made with Héctor Tosta under the name Titanic. That record is lighter, more traditionally melodic, and relies on Fratti’s delicate, watercolor voice to illuminate the duo’s vibrant, roving jazz compositions. But with Amor Muere, Fratti is free to wander across craggier terrain, and her voice offers a dulcet reprieve from the strange noises she and her bandmates conjure. On “Can We Provoke Reciprocal Reaction,” Fratti’s vocalizations intertwine with Mandoki’s smoky timbre, repeating, “Oh, this life/I want it all again/I faded out,” atop plucked strings and wailing synthesizer. The ambling, circular rhythm mimics the song’s inspiration: a daily walk. Amor Muere treat the quotidian activity with a sense of wonder, peppering the song with springy, metallic, jaw-harp-like noises, injecting a sense of playfulness into the sense of repetitive motion.",Experimental,8.0
657,"The London producer’s frosty new album is an enigmatic journey through windy ambient passages, glossy R&B melodies, and frenzied piano. Before she made her singular brand of beguiling, textured experimental music, Klein’s first love was filmmaking. In a 2018 interview, the South London composer and producer even joked that her music career is “a ploy to win an Oscar.” Her latest album, touched by an angel, gives credence to this ambition. It is a wintry odyssey that elides easy interpretation while offering fascinating glimpses into the life of its creator. At nearly 90 minutes, it has the immersive feel of a feature-length film.touched achieves this placid, weightless ecstasy through unlikely vocal manipulation and warped instrumentation. The record is composed of windy ambient passages that threaten to swallow the listener, naked piano that flies up and down like a mad Tinkerbell, and glossy R&B melodies buried under static and distortion. Distant train whistles recur as motifs, transporting us to ambiguous planes of memory. Listening to the album can feel like skating on an icy pond until suddenly you’ve ascended, your feet barely skimming the ground.Lyrics are few and far between, giving only hints into the inspiration behind the music. (The title, touched by an angel, allegedly comes from a Christian TV show that Klein watched with her mom.) On highlight “say black power and mean it,” metallic percussion ricochets before tempestuous static blankets the track in a layer of fuzz. On “storm,” synthetic strings beckon from the darkness, joined by recorder squeaks, burbles, and the sound of flapping wings. The 10-minute “no weapon shall form against me” crescendos into staticky yells that become more overwhelming as they repeat. Even when you hear human voices, they are often scrambled, unintelligible.Mainstream pop culture has always existed on the outskirts of Klein’s music, and here she incorporates specific allusions to express feelings of alienation. On “black famous,” the album’s opener and most rousing song, Klein references Drake’s “Started From the Bottom,” flipping his flex to evoke a sense of loss without resolution. “Started from the bottom, man/She’s still in the bottom, man,” she says with a devotional quality. The music video for “DJ drop,” a hypnotic meditation built from train whistle and looped croons, focuses on a plastic bag’s journey on the sidewalk: It functions both as a tongue-in-cheek nod to Katy Perry and a somber visualization of feeling invisible as a person of color.The eight-minute “street cred” exemplifies the entrancing idiosyncrasies of Klein’s music. Over a simple hum, she rewinds her voice again and again, creating alien melodies from repetitive snippets of unintelligible words. Her chirpy, pitch-shifted vocals sound hypnotizing but disorienting. It’s a dazzling performance that leaves you captivated, even as Klein slips away from our grasp once again.",Experimental,7.4
658,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit a 1995 album that changed the sound of dancehall while pointing the genre in a newly reflective direction. “Strangest feeling I’m feeling/But Jah love we will always believe in/Though you may think my fate is in vain/’Til Shiloh, we chant Rastafari’s name.”These two lines, delivered in a fervent a cappella, comprise the entirety of the first track on Buju Banton’s 1995 album ’Til Shiloh. The legendary deejay’s raspy voice—until then typically heard booming from the towering 10,000-watt sound systems of open-air dancehall sessions—seemed instead to conjure the resonant wooden chancel of a church; the way it rose in tone, from hushed to beseeching, gave it the unmistakable contour of a prayer, an entreaty aimed at once inward and skyward. Taken on its own, it might easily be heard as a snatch of gospel music, yet the divine names Jah and Rastafari placed the song squarely outside the strictures of mainstream Christianity.Banton was then Jamaica’s most prominent artist and reggae’s rawest voice—whether measured in the sheer volume of his thundering basso or the unfiltered sex and violence of his lyrics. But “Shiloh,” just 18 seconds long, signaled a shift. If this first track contained within its mesmerizing tranquility a half-formed question about what sort of album might follow, the second—“’Til I’m Laid to Rest”—offered a definitive answer. Opening with wordless vocalizations reminiscent of Ladysmith Black Mambazo’s traditional Zulu harmonies, it was anchored solely by Nyabinghi hand drums.Atop this self-consciously traditional accompaniment, Buju unveiled a vocal declamation that was shockingly inventive in form, adapting his signature deejay style—a gruff baritone polyrhythm more closely associated with dance-friendly catchphrases—to a classic protest song: “Oh, I’m in bondage, living is a mess/I’ve got to rise up, alleviate the stress/No longer will I expose my weakness/He who seeks knowledge begins with humbleness.”The effect was electrifying, combining the gritty emotional pull of a blues lament and the mystic aura of the best roots reggae with the rhythmic dexterity and extemporization of a soundclash champion. Producer Bobby Digital would later issue this rhythmic bed as a juggling riddim, featuring other vocalists over a filled-out arrangement with rhythm guitar and a harder kick and snare pattern, called the “Kette Drum” riddim, but when Buju wrapped his constantly modulating double-time around this slow, stripped-down version, most listeners had never heard anything like it.At the time of ’Til Shiloh’s release, dancehall had been recognized as its own art form, something more than just a subset of reggae, for less than a decade. Buju, at the ripe old age of 22, was its undisputed king. He began deejaying seriously in the late ’80s, hanging around Kingston sound systems like Rambo Mango and Culture Love, waiting for a chance to hold the mic, then haunting studio gates, hoping to record. Although “The Ruler,” for producer Robert Ffrench, was the first Buju 45 pressed to vinyl, his 1991 breakout hit “Stamina Daddy,” for Winston Riley’s Techniques label, established his star persona: a lanky beanpole of a youth assuming the macho swagger of a bigger man, complete with a deep, gravelly voice that emulated his namesake, the older sound system star Burro Banton.",Pop,9.4
659,"Newly reissued on vinyl, the most experimental album from the Charlottesville jam institution explores the uneasy zone between celebratory anthems and grim lamentations. In the summer of 1997, the Dave Matthews Band reigned as unlikely alt-rock superstars. The group’s major label debut, 1994’s Under the Table and Dreaming, elevated them from heroes of Virginia’s progressive roots scene to mainstream success, and 1996’s Crash made an even bigger splash, propelled by the ubiquitous hit single “Crash Into Me” and a resultant Grammy win. As was their style, DMB had dedicated most of the years between to touring, jamming ebulliently to crowds of adoring fans who were, as comedian and podcaster Marc Maron would eventually put it, only truly comfortable while “jigging around in an arena with other like-minded people.”That DMB was difficult to classify hadn’t barred them from hitmaker status, but the spotlight left Matthews feeling restless. “Maybe you couldn’t call them pop and you couldn’t call them jazz and you certainly couldn’t call them rock,” producer Steve Lillywhite told Relix in 2018. “What were they?” With 1998’s Before These Crowded Streets, Dave and co. asserted that whatever you thought they were, they were something different. Newly remastered and reissued on vinyl to commemorate its 25th anniversary (puzzlingly sans bonus material, given the ponderance of archival tape), the record represents DMB at its most nakedly ambitious. The core of the band’s sound remained intact: maximalist rhythms from drummer Carter Beauford and bassist Stefan Lessard undergirding Matthews’ buoyant odes to abandon, while the melodic runs of saxophone/flutist LeRoi Moore and sawing fiddle of Boyd Tinsley offer counterpoints. These songs, however, explode the template with gothic romance, horror, and yes, a few goofy odes to bliss.As work began on the record, DMB were tasked with contributing a recording to Wes Craven’s meta-horror sequel Scream 2. Though the band owed its stardom to peppy, worldbeat and jazz-inflected acoustic rock, one entry from Matthews’ songbook made immediate sense for inclusion: “Halloween,” an uncharacteristically aggressive number about a jilted lover that originally appeared on the group’s 1994 pre-major label EP Recently. They got to work on an update, shaping the queasy, see-sawing composition into something more sinister. Matthews’ voice usually sounded friendly and jovial. Now he was howling, dripping menace and bile, part Tom Waits with a side of Vincent Price. The band began wondering if perhaps the song was too interesting to give away, so they reversed course, submitting “Help Myself,” an old reworked tune, instead.“Halloween” is a testament to the darkness that lingered in the corners of the breezy music of the Dave Matthews Band from the very beginning. With Crowded Streets, that darkness moved to the fore, unavoidable even among supremely horny songs like “Stay (Wasting Time),” the knotty funk of “Rapunzel,” and the sleek and devotional “Crush,” where Lessard’s Mingus-inspired bassline and blocky jazz chords impart an air of smoky sophistication. “No need to bear the weight of your worries/Let them all fall away,” Matthews sings at the start of the record; then he and his collaborators spend the next hour documenting all manner of anxiety.",Rock,7.6
660,"Will Anderson amplifies everyday heartbreak with towering shoegaze and supersized power-pop anthems that demand to be played loud. For most of its existence, shoegaze promised a glimpse of an alternate plane of existence, either in the womb, the afterlife, or the unconscious. You know, “dreamlike,” “heavenly,” “ethereal”—whatever assured transcendence from this mortal coil. Mere words melt into suggestive, non-verbal cues. The typical hierarchy of rock band instrumentation dissolves, the guitars and bass and drums surging as one utopian soundwave. The right effects bank can turn that piece of wood you used to strum “Wonderwall” into a jet engine or a swarm of comets. And though shoegaze has repeatedly rejuvenated itself by merging with digicore, black metal, emo, and even alt-country, perhaps the most impactful change for the genre over the past decade is its acceptance of life on life’s shittiest terms, emerging now from the cramped apartments and overworked laptops of the bummed-out and broke. Such as Will Anderson, the mid-30s mastermind behind Hotline TNT’s intoxicating second LP, Cartwheel, where an average guy’s everyday heartbreak is blown up into a Loveless for the lovelorn.Hotline TNT Filter Heartbreak Through Dizzying, Distorted Guitar RockThough Anderson made his reputation in cosmopolitan Vancouver and Brooklyn, Cartwheel exposes his roots as a quintessential Midwestern indie rocker, born in Wisconsin and mo(u)lded by a non-musical stint in Minneapolis. Much of Cartwheel abides to the Copper Blue standard of redlining power-pop, impressing itself equally with sticky, circular melodies and concussive volumes. But when Hotline TNT tap the keg and hit the gas on “Out of Town,” Anderson throws a winking “baby girl” into the first line and channels his inner Paul Westerberg. “We had to betray the Bob Mould guidance one of these days and see how the other half lives,” he joked in a statement. To Hotline TNT, those Twin Cities indie rock icons aren’t just role models, they’re the authors of the commandments: Be striving but skeptical, passionate but never pretentious.The Twin/Tone influence on Cartwheel is obvious, and so is its spirituality, drawing out the Midwestern tendency to manifest modesty as self-deprecation and/or self-sabotage. In the early aughts, Anderson made a non-SEO-friendly name for himself with the scuzzy noise-rock project Weed. Hotline TNT gave themselves a similarly hard time by withholding their debut Nineteen in Love from streaming and trying to generate momentum as a live act during the thick of the pandemic. It can’t be a coincidence that the Cartwheel cover art imagines a bootleg Charlie Brown T-shirt, because Anderson spends most of the album breaking his own heart in 10 words or less: “After the fall/I pretend it’s all my fault,” “Tell better lies/Unsatisfied/Maybe next time.” Lead single “I Thought You’d Change” is the most hopeful song on Cartwheel and, for that reason, also the saddest; after whiffing so many times, why would he expect anyone to change?",Rock,8.4
661,"Newly reissued and remastered, the Gallagher brothers’ 1998 B-sides collection remains a smartly curated, thoughtfully sequenced set that stands among their finest work. The Masterplan poses one of the great “what if?” scenarios in rock history. What if Noel Gallagher had saved all the A-side-worthy B-sides he was cranking out between 1994 and 1997 for a proper Oasis album? What if they had released that batch of songs as their third full-length instead of the overblown and underwhelming Be Here Now? What if, instead of sounding Britpop’s death knell, Oasis’ third album kept the party going into the new millennium, thereby negating the need for dejected fans to take solace in Travis and Coldplay? Who knows, maybe Oasis still would’ve traveled up their own arse en route to “All Around the World” anyway, but at least that indulgence would’ve felt a little more earned.Be Here Now didn’t exactly derail Oasis’ career—we should all be so lucky to flop at 8 million copies sold—but the album effectively fast-tracked the band’s transition from zeitgeist-shaping force to heritage act. (The stats don’t lie—15 years into their career, Oasis were still pulling two-thirds of the setlist from the Definitely Maybe/Morning Glory era.) So when B-sides compilation The Masterplan arrived a year after Be Here Now’s big boom and bust, it effectively dumped salt onto a still-fresh wound. And to this day, it stands as a taunting totem to what Oasis’ third album could’ve been. “The Masterplan should have been Be Here Now, and Be Here Now should have been a bunch of B-sides,” Noel admitted in a 2019 interview. “Somebody should have been fucking bright enough to stand up and say: ‘You can't fucking put these out as B-sides, you’re fucking mental’… The one major regret I have in my professional life is I wasn’t aware enough.”As such, UK fans could be forgiven for thinking The Masterplan was just a cash grab, a hastily assembled collection of B-sides that were already widely available on CD singles, some barely a year old. But in North America, The Masterplan was a crucial act of fan service. In the ’90s, the stateside singles market had been all but snuffed out by a music industry that had conditioned consumers to pay $23.99 for a full album to get the one or two songs they liked. By contrast, fans in the UK were receiving a steady stream of singles every few months, accompanied by B-sides that formed an entire parallel shadow discography to the popular favorites. But The Masterplan had no designs on being a comprehensive collection of Oasis castaways. Rather, it’s a smartly curated, thoughtfully sequenced set that can stand proudly on the shoulders of the band’s unimpeachable first two albums. (The fact that this reissue/remaster contains no additional tracks or alterations suggests an undying respect for its original form.)",Rock,8.0
662,"The Australian musician chooses herself over the bullshit on a cheeky, colorful album that flexes greater musical confidence. Tkay Maidza’s three-part Last Year Was Weird EP series was a hairpin turn for an artist looking for a new direction. Moving on from stadium-ready EDM-pop-rap, the Australian musician flaunted a more eclectic range while giving herself space to own the mess of being in the spotlight. She dove into lush digital funk, explosive SOPHIE-style bangers, and cheeky hip-hop with the unrestrained zeal of a kid in a ball pit while also sharpening her confidence. One second she’d be slithering through chest-thumping industrial hip-hop; the next, she’d be cooing over jaunty guitars and whistles.Sweet Justice, Maidza’s sophomore album and her first full-length in seven years, expands on that growing musical confidence, the whiplash between funk, dance, and industrial styles more intense than ever. With fiery lyrics and sharper bravado, it’s an album largely about karma: “Eat your heart out on a silver plate/They been fishy so I’m eating steak/On the hook I catch ‘em with the bait/Get up out my face is si vous plait,” she boasts on “WUACV,” named after the meme used when someone’s feeling particularly chaotic. She’s flippant toward her detractors, thoughtful as she navigates life and love. Sweet and sing-songy on highlight “Out of Luck,” she asserts her self-worth against people who demand her time but couldn’t give two shits about her. Generally, Maidza’s vision of justice isn’t based in direct retribution—she knows that choosing herself over the bullshit is the best revenge. “I should buy my bag a bag,” she says, an elite and hilarious flex.This time producer Dan Farber, who had a heavy hand in the sound of the Weird EPs, cedes space to bigger names, who bring grandeur to her songs. Take the Flume-assisted “Silent Assassin,” which turns sirens, 808s, and video game sound effects into a laser tag field for Maidza to charge at haters. Or the Kaytranada-produced “Our Way,” a smooth dance funk number where Maidza demands a lover to step their game: “Never needed all them roses/I just wanna know I’m chosen.” Like her idols Missy Elliott and Santigold, she can bend her airy voice to any beat, and that’s half the fun.With Sweet Justice, Maidza is walking the path of artists like Tinashe, who had an easier time finding themselves the further away from the mainstream machine they got. And despite a few stumbles—”WASP” and closing track “Walking On Air” are the album’s most generic offerings—her frenetic fire-and-ice routine is impressive. She’s grown up without losing her freshness, refining the skill and intensity that got her here in the first place. This is the swagger and range that’s appealed her to artists from Billie Eilish to Kari Faux: Maidza makes the act of taking what’s yours sound like a multicolored daydream.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

663,"After fronting the rock band State Champion, the Louisville artist crafts a solo debut full of vivid songwriting and cosmic-slacker jams. In Kurt Vonnegut’s debut novel, 1952’s Player Piano, the author delivered one of his defining ideas through the mouth of his character Ed Finnerty: “Out on the edge you see all kinds of things you can’t see from the center… Big, undreamed-of things—the people on the edge see them first.” Seventy years on, the Kentucky-based songwriter Ryan Davis traces life’s edges in the same spirit, contemplating the human capacities for open-hearted euphoria and harrowing pain.Dancing on the Edge is Davis’ first record under his own name, but it’s hardly a debut: He’s fronted the ragged rock band State Champion, led Louisville’s heady Cropped Out festival, and established Sophomore Lounge, an indie label with a fierce DIY spirit. In carrying his own banner forward, Davis steps into more of a singer-songwriter role, calibrating his focus on twangy, witty tunes. With the humor and wisdom of a good-natured barfly, he shares his meditations on mortality and finding purpose in a short, messy stint on Earth.Davis has a gift for vivid imagery and inventive turns of phrase, which he applies liberally. As evidenced by the extended metaphor he offers in “Junk Drawer Heart,” Davis homes in on the details of life with idiosyncratic precision. He says he’s seen “sunsets through each and every shade of beer,” and in shaking off the black clouds that chase him, he declares, “Constantine didn’t make Saturday night for sitting here acting like this.” Enumerating the rest would spoil the fun of their patient unfurling, but Davis’ inclinations cast him as an affable narrator of rough and rowdy environs. He hits a Kenny Powers-esque high of crass poetry when he observes the inevitability of the dirty truth coming to light: “Blacklight will find the jizz.”Elsewhere, Davis sings openly about fear and vulnerability. Here, too, he finds moments of levity as he’s confronting his deepest existential concerns. He describes “playing ‘got your nose’ with the face of death” in “Learn 2 Re-Luv,” an accounting of imperfections with an imploring heart. The colorful moments have their poignant complements, as when he circles a more pronounced sense of hopelessness in “Bluebirds in a Fight.” He rests his observations on piano, pedal steel, and cushy bass padding, prioritizing a somber mood that diverges from the record’s prevailing mellow but restless spirit.The loose arrangements of Davis’ backing Roadhouse Band swing further into cosmic-slacker territory than the more serrated stuff he’s delivered with State Champion. Acoustic guitars set a sanguine tone that Christopher May chases on pedal steel, and synthy flashes add more jolts of color. The harmonic twists match the exploratory spirit of Davis’ metaphors, enhanced by vocal contributions from guests like Joan Shelley, Will Lawrence, and Freakwater’s Catherine Irwin. The songs tend to lope along with the relaxed pleasure of taking the scenic route home. In the unhurried “A Suitable Exit,” he repeats the phrase “Death has loaned us to life,” while a corkscrewing fiddle line helps carry the point.",Rock,7.9
664,"The Mexico City duo of Mabe Fratti and Héctor Tosta break with the hushed beauty of the cellist’s earlier work, exploring sprawling new directions in modern composition, jazz, and art song. When we last heard from Mexico City-based cellist and singer Mabe Fratti, she was exploring sun-baked, sand-blasted textures on 2022’s Se Ve Desde Aquí. It was a shift from the earthy chaos of her earlier albums, where shape-shifting instruments tangled like root systems of ancient, verdant trees. This summer, Fratti announced a new project, a collaboration with her live-show linchpin Héctor Tosta, aka I. la Católica. They called it Titanic, which certainly takes nerve: Would the duo tackle Céline Dion? The much-missed Kirsty MacColl’s breathy folk-rock? Would it be camp? Would it be a disaster? Their debut album is confident in its ambitions. Vidrio cross-pollinates the spatial management Fratti has spent the past few years cultivating with Tosta’s taste for prog sprawl. The album’s title is a word for “glass.” The record is a window overlooking fertile plots of modern composition, jazz, and art song.“Anónima” digs in with sharp whacks at Fratti’s cello, some crashing drums, ringing piano that collapses the separation between melody and rhythm, and chiming percussion that does the same. Above all else, there’s Fratti’s voice. She intones the title (translation: “anonymous”) as trails of reverb slowly surround her. Her voice doubles, quadruples, too clear and strong to stay unknown for long.Much of Virdrio’s beauty sprouts from the juxtaposition of Fratti’s voice (and that of her cello, which she also makes sing, as if it had not only a neck but a throat) and the various experimental grounds she and Tosta map out. In “Hotel Elizabeth,” Fratti stumbles into a jazzbo waltz; her voice sometimes leads its partner, Jarrett Gilgore’s beastly saxophone, around the dancefloor, and sometimes they do little dances of their own, Fratti never losing her cool in the face of Gilgore’s reedy tantrums. “Entre mis contradicciones crece una flor” (“In between my contradictions grows a flower”), she sings, and her voice sounds like it’s doing just that.Fratti and Tosta initially drafted much of the album together on synths and drum machines. But their mutual appreciation for both the praxis and finished products of Talk Talk inspired these final versions, which take long jams and use them as stems for studio arrangements. “Circulo Perfecto” shows off the appeal of the process, with its thoughtful precision serving as an ideal vessel for Fratti’s chatty vocal runs.“En Paralelo” is decidedly darker, with Fratti sawing and hacking at her strings like she’s Bernard Herrmann and speak-singing like she’s Trish Keenan—and what follows, the diabolical “Te evite,” grows and thickens and worries its way towards the deep dark woods Broadcast lost themselves within. Instead, we arrive in the grand “Palacio,” in which piano chords climb five stairs, again and again, only to reach an agonizing suspension of strings, feedback, horn, and silence, and then tumble back down again. It’s frustrating, fascinating, and kind of funny, too. Fratti shares a sense of drama with brainy singers like Nico, Björk, Kate Bush, and Meredith Monk, but her songs often feel smaller in scale, little blossoms instead of great fields of ground and sky.",Experimental,8.3
665,"The Austin band’s first album in 18 years puts an ever-so-slightly sharper edge on their familiar, slow-burning indie rock. “Punk as Fuck” is American Analog Set’s definitive song and not just because it’s their most popular. The opener of 2001’s Know by Heart doesn’t hit all that different than “A Good Friend is Always Around,” “Come Home Baby Julie, Come Home,” “Dim Stars (The Boy in My Arms),” or any other song with a title that more accurately reflects the Austin band’s music. Their bashful take on slowpoke indie rock was initially seen as an extension of Yo La Tengo and Stereolab, and it was a formative influence on Ben Gibbard, who appeared on an AmAnSet track named “The Postman” two years before Give Up. Throughout their initial run straddling the turn of the 21st century, the Austinites stuck to one sound, and they had a sense of humor about the reputation it earned them.The nice thing about having such a defined aesthetic is that any incremental adjustment can have a profound impact, like a cruise ship sailing half a degree off course. For Forever, the first American Analog Set album in 18 years, doesn’t really rock, but it’s not afraid to get in your face. The instruments are stripped of the cottony production of their Emperor Jones era, the synths completely devoid of retro kitsch. You’d figure that a song that shares its name with a Judas Priest classic would be For Forever’s “Punk as Fuck,” an ironic allusion to everything this band is not. But “Screaming for Vengeance” really is the most metal thing American Analog Set have ever made, if only because the mix is completely dominated by a bass riff that judders like a close-mic’d trampoline spring.It’s all relative, but “the hardest American Analog Set album” still applies. As with many of his peers in the early aughts, Andrew Kenny’s lyrics had a mean streak masked by a librarian whisper. But as every sound on For Forever becomes more rigid and aggressive, Kenny takes on a snarl that highlights the nastier tone. While “Over the Jeans” and “By the Bridle” could be interpreted as obituaries for the indie rom-com era that American Analog Set helped soundtrack, “Screaming for Vengeance” has little room for interpretation. “It’s young love/You get fucked/You’re gonna bleed a lot,” he hisses.Still, none of this comes off as urgent or bracing. For Forever is not the result of a pandemic-induced reckoning or an opportunity to capitalize on an unexpected flourishing of influence; a Numero Group reissue of the band’s first three albums isn’t set to arrive until 2024. Rather, it’s been described as the result of guys slowly remembering they liked hanging out together and years of surreptitious jamming awaiting a proper outlet.",Rock,6.9
666,"The Cincinnati synth-punk trio dials up the energy on a zippy new album. The Serfs’ 2020 debut, Sounds of Serfdom, seemed tailor-made to the tastes of the goth YouTube algorithm, where success scales with how '80s to-the-letter your band sounds—see the frictionless coldwave of Molchat Doma. The Cincinnati trio’s early releases scanned as little more than lo-fi imitations of their influences, nervy, bare-bones cartridges of minimal wave that played like Oppenheimer Analysis B-sides with less variation. But on their third album Half Eaten by Dogs, the Serfs up the ante, imbuing their once-pallid synth-punk with color and velocity.Opener “Order Imposing Sentence” hurtles forward like a car on the brink of falling apart, stringing together clanking percussion, a spirited guitar riff, and shouted, Gun Club-style vocals. “Suspension Bridge Collapse” and “Cheap Chrome” have a similar liveliness. Like Sextile and Mandy, Indiana, the Serfs charge gritty post-punk with glitter of dance music, adding more gleam while retaining their own rough, spirited voice. “Club Deuce” is the serpentine gem at the album’s center: Bright, lucid synths pingpong across cavernous claps as keyboardist Andie Luman whispers cryptic nothings. The effect is intoxicating. While McCartney's vocals for The Serfs sometimes lend a soporific effect to the songs, distorted and flat, Luman’s ghostly presence elevates the intrigue.Half Eaten by Dogs is noticeably frontloaded, slowing down in the back half. While these songs are mostly satisfying, they can start to feel like a drag. The dreamy glissade of “The Dice Man Will Become” lasts so long that it starts to feel immaterial; the closer “Mocking Laughter” peters into static, a disappointing ending to an album that’s so dynamic. But there’s still a strong spirit to the Serf’s songwriting, and they have stoked a remarkable fire beneath their sound, pushing themselves in a zippy and promising new direction.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

667,"John Darnielle delves into the lore of 2002’s All Hail West Texas with a soft-rock opera that adds baroque arrangements to his brutal, tender storytelling. Few working artists have accumulated a richer body of lore than the Mountain Goats. Across a vast catalog spanning more than 30 years, John Darnielle has developed a mythology with enough recurring characters and references to fill its own Wiki and support a number of dedicated blogs and podcasts. The Sophoclean title of new album Jenny From Thebes announces it as a continuation of the myth cycle. A sequel to Darnielle’s 2002 lo-fi masterpiece All Hail West Texas, his latest album revisits some of the most beloved characters and settings in the Mountain Goats universe.That earlier album was a loose collection of story fragments about down-and-out people; making out the whole picture required some close reading. Jenny From Thebes doesn’t continue the story so much as fill out its absent center: Jenny, a recovering addict who runs a safehouse in a small West Texas town. When Jenny has appeared in other Mountain Goats songs, she has functioned as a vague emblem of freedom: riding in on her custom Kawasaki motorcycle, promising escape. These songs bring Jenny back down to the sordid everyday while also imbuing that desperate reality with the soft glow of magic.Inside John Darnielle’s Boiling BrainDespite the thematic callback to Darnielle’s home-recorded early work, the Mountain Goats have never sounded so baroque. Working with producer Trina Shoemaker, the now-standard lineup of Darnielle, bassist Peter Hughes, drummer Jon Wurster, and multi-instrumentalist Matt Douglas gets a lift with expansive string and horn arrangements, and Bully’s Alicia Bognanno contributes icy stabs of echoing guitar. If this is a rock opera, it is a soft-rock opera. The plush arrangements insulate the often brutal scenes depicted in the lyrics. The jittery strums and surging backbeat on “Murder at the 18th St. Garage” make its titular crime—Jenny killing her scumbag landlord—feel like a victory. In the standout “Water Tower,” a forensic account of Jenny disposing of the body turns into a lullaby: “Float downstream,” Darnielle murmurs over a soft bed of guitars. It’s the sound of tragedy recollected from afar, not reported live from the scene.In a way, Jenny From Thebes is precisely about the struggle to find the right distance: from the past, from other people, from ourselves. Darnielle is a master of the perspective shot; he is often at his most vivid when writing in the second person. The narrator of “Cleaning Crew,” a loping response song to West Texas’ “Source Decay,” imagines the pain of the addressee in medically precise detail, almost as if it were her own. The tenderness of these observations, together with the warmth of the vocal delivery, ensures that it takes a few verses to realize that the song is actually a farewell.Early in the strings-driven “Same as Cash,” where the speaker tries to reconstruct Jenny’s inner life, this realization emerges: “I can only see the scene secondhand/I can only try to understand.” This statement underlines Jenny’s tragic flaw: a compulsion to take on others’ burdens until she breaks. It also happens to be a pretty good encapsulation of what the Mountain Goats do well. Darnielle has spent his career trying to get inside the heads of injured athletes, dead celebrities, pagan warriors, and struggling junkies, finding the humanity in their particular suffering. The acknowledgement that we can never have total access is far from damning—it’s what gives his songs their license to operate. Perhaps that’s why those lines about our flailing attempts to connect appear near the beginning of “Same as Cash” and not the end. Rather than cutting the story short, they clear the ground for it to continue.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

668,"The Maryland R&B star’s third album is stacked with DMV-area talent and storytelling reminiscent of your most toxic ex. But how does he really feel? Brent Faiyaz is the guy in the club who seems mysterious and knows it. He’s got the moody-yet-cool lane on lock, and it’s made him one of the most prominent men in R&B right now. There’s nothing too deep about it, but when it works, it’s like his life is a Scorsese montage of short-term relationships that end with his suitcase getting tossed out the window. His velvety speak-sing won’t blow you away—especially if you were raised in a crib where weekends were soundtracked by the supernatural smoothness of Luther and such—but it is effortlessly fly. As a songwriter, the Maryland native relishes in being the villain (it won’t come as a surprise that he has said he “grew up on Max B and Dipset”). In the process his name has become a descriptor of its own—for the kind of dude who’ll play games with your heart.What keeps the fuckery in Brent Faiyaz’s music feeling like real life instead of image upkeep is the setting. Since his breakout moment with the silky hook on “Crew”—with D.C. rappers GoldLink and Shy Glizzy—there’s been a sense that even if one of his late-night adventures takes place in L.A. or New York, all roads lead back to D.C., Maryland, and Virginia. On the heels of last year’s underwhelming but extremely popular Wasteland comes Larger Than Life, a life-is-good album where Faiyaz could easily have chosen to pop champagne to his success by bringing all of today’s most powerful rap and R&B artists into the fold. Instead he pays homage to his home by getting both regional pioneers and up-and-comers involved in his mess.To underline the point, Larger Than Life kicks off with one of those timeless intros from Virginia Beach’s Timbaland that sounds like it’s been ripped off an answering machine. Once the smoke clears for Faiyaz’s naturally icy croons, the immediately recognizable sample is TLC’s “No Scrubs,” which sounds like a jittery Timbo beat but of course isn’t. No context necessary, though: Faiyaz’s conversational and flirtatious delivery is as crisp as ever. That’s followed up by “Last One Left,” another obvious flip, this one derived from Timbo’s beat for Missy Elliott’s “Crazy Feelings.” (Missy, another Virginia native, is here too, basically re-recording the cascading hook of the original.) What could have been just karaoke is spiced up by a pretty batshit verse where Faiyaz lectures some poor girl about getting relationship advice from her friends: “If they gon’ run yo’ life, then get your ass out of mine,” he sings sweetly, as if he’s not in full guilt-trip mode. Tacked on at the end is emerging Maryland rapper Lil Gray, spitting one of those radio-friendly guest features you could expect from Fabolous or Fat Joe in the early 2000s.",Pop,7.0
669,"The Barcelona musician expands her dizzying art-pop sound with sharper hooks and a feistier spirit. The first time you hear one of Marina Herlop’s songs, it might sound almost incomprehensible. Much of her singing comes from a place beyond language; her piercing harmonies, switchbacking rhythms, and sudden modal pivots are just as disorienting. The Barcelona musician’s songs are equally inspired by 20th-century avant-garde composition and centuries-old folk music, but they appear mostly like alien galaxies modeled upon non-euclidean principles. After prolonged exposure, though, a funny thing happens: They come to feel not just familiar but entirely natural, imbued with all the seeming inevitability of pop music, as though each brain-twisting tone cluster were an expression of some universal law. Bewilderment has rarely sounded quite so catchy.Herlop wrote her new album, Nekkuja, in the interim between recording her breakout, Pripyat, and its long-delayed 2022 release. She has been performing the songs in concert for two years—often enough that if you’ve seen her once or twice, and checked in regularly with her Instagram stories, you’ll have assimilated even their most labyrinthine twists and turns by now. The music is an extension of the jewel-toned art pop she began with Pripyat; the songs are similar in sound and feel, but they are also punchier, with sharper hooks and a feistier spirit. Though shorter than its predecessor by three minutes, the new album feels more ambitious and more daring.Herlop delights in pulling out the tablecloth from beneath her carefully appointed songs, leaving cutlery and stemware quivering dangerously in place. “Busa” begins placidly enough: Mellotron-like flutes, spiderwebbed harp melodies, the clacking of a typewriter. A peal of elfin laughter from her friend (la Busa, for whom the song is named) ripples across the stereo field. But jagged tritone synths stab crosswise through the arrangement; stacked vocal harmonies (“Pollen! Pollen! Pollen!”) slice like an industrial laser. “Cosset” opens with the woozy chimes of a deranged Christmas carol, but it abruptly shifts in mood and intensity, as thrumming drum’n’bass rhythms and jazz-funk electric bass take over. Singing a one-word chorus in Catalan—“Worms, worms, worms”—Herlop’s multi-tracked voice soars while underneath, the rhythm section shudders like heavy machinery. Angel choirs and earth movers reach an uneasy détente.“Nekkuja,” it turns out, is a made-up word. Herlop says that she came up with it after a long search for the precise configuration of syllables that might express the nexus of sounds, colors, and textures that she had in her head. Herlop has always been a master fabulist, but these songs reveal what a vivid lyricist and meticulous composer she has become. The album is loosely themed around the idea of gardening—a preoccupation she nurtured in those difficult years awaiting Pripyat’s release, when she felt her creativity withering on the vine, and she turned her thoughts to ideas of nurturing, custodianship, and the necessity of making peace with that which cannot be controlled.Marina Herlop Is Classically Trained and Totally Chaotic—Her Music Thrives on BothShe opens the record with a line—“Damunt de tu només les flors” (“Above you only the flowers”)—borrowed from Frederic Mompou, a Catalan composer beloved for his minimalist piano pieces, that she spins into a magic-realist poem about childbirth and history, with a chorus like an armored-up nursery rhyme. She touches upon complementary images as she goes: slivers of light in her hands; trees that are sick of humans; roots pushing to shatter the sky. Her byzantine world-building comes to a head on “Reina Mora,” where nervous wooden clicks and flickering handclaps are spun into a controlled rhythmic fury that makes me wonder what a Herlop/Jlin collaboration might sound like. A brief interlude connects “Reina Mora” to the album’s final track, “Babel,” an elastic fugue for what might be hammered dulcimer, striking a perilous balance between Arca and Arvo Pärt. Both songs share the same lyrics, and at the end of “Babel” she returns to the line that opened the album, repeated with one final twist: “Damunt de tu només les flors/Damunt de tu només l’esforç” (“Above you only the flowers/Above you only the effort”). Her voice is split, like light through a prism, into stark harmonic bands, and the album’s parable of sowing and reaping becomes clear; incomprehensible toil gives way to the ecstasy of creation. Worms, pollen, roses emerging from wombs: Rarely are the agonies of the creative process brought so enchantingly to life.",Electronic,8.0
670,"Vancouver’s atmospheric noisemakers team up with Norwegian dream-pop artist Tuvaband, whose luminous voice brings focus to the group’s sprawling avant-prog. Bands that peg their name to their sound risk painting themselves into a corner, but on their earliest DIY recordings, Vancouver duo New Age Doom embraced truth in advertising. If not quite as gimmicky as their moniker might suggest—what if Laraaji made a Sunn0))) record, lol—releases like 2019’s self-titled anthology and 2020’s Himalayan Dream Techno staked out the middle ground between the cathedral and the commune, filtering heavy metal’s black-mass grandeur and percussive thunder through the free-flowing serenity and found-sound ingenuity of ’70s private-press ambient recordings. But since then, the New Age Doom name has come to represent less a cheeky genre mash-up than a guiding philosophy, a means to manifest the balance of natural beauty and apocalyptic chaos that governs life on Earth. Sure, New Age Doom are the sort of act who will set up shop on the street to startle unsuspecting passersby, but they also just might be the only noise band with their own brand of plant-based cashew dip.Though centered on the core duo of guitarist Greg Valou and drummer Eric J. Breitenbach, New Age Doom have broadened their horizons on every album, often with help from collaborators. The most notable of these was 2021’s Lee “Scratch” Perry’s Guide to the Universe, where New Age Doom and a team of guest players backed up the dub legend on the final album he recorded in his lifetime. Their new release enlists many of the same musicians—including Blackstar bassist Tim Lefebvre and trumpet player Daniel Rosenboom—to support another vocalist, but the lead-role casting and musical approach couldn’t be more different. Where Guide to the Universe saw New Age Doom play a more subservient role to Perry, complementing their hero’s stream-of-conscious poetry with suitably zoned-out soundscapes, There Is No End has them constructing more concrete arrangements around the Norwegian dream-pop artist Tuva Hellum Marschhäuser, aka Tuvaband, whose luminous voice functions as the beacon that guides them through the stormiest passages.There Is No End builds a bridge between the two projects’ respective worlds. Its opening track, “In the Beginning,” expands upon an idea introduced on Tuvaband’s “By the Time You Hear This,” the centerpiece of her 2023 album New Orders, where Marschhäuser asks, “Is this the end of the start of the end of the start of the end/Or is it the start of the end of the start of the end of the start?” In their original context, those words seemed to address the uncertain status of a relationship, but on “In the Beginning,” she weaves a similarly cyclical sentiment into something more like a Zen koan: “In the beginning, I’m just beginning,” she states matter-of-factly, “and in the end there is no end.” New Age Doom put that doctrine into action with a track that slowly whips itself into a towering inferno of tambura melodies, transcendental trumpet flourishes, and surging percussive grooves, before everything comes crashing down at the six-minute mark. But what initially sounds like a dramatic, drum-set-toppling finale is actually a gateway to the song’s extended coda, where the expanded ensemble smashes and thrashes with furious intensity for five more minutes until the clamor gives way to clarity.",Experimental,7.6
671,"The Pacific Northwest metal duo’s riveting new album is a sludgy and simmering call to action. Ragana’s saints weren’t canonized by a specific religion; they were forged by fire. In the sanctuary of a century-old Catholic church-turned-studio in Anacortes, Washington, the Oakland via Olympia metal duo of Coley and Maria (who do not publicly share their last names) paid their respects to their queer and trans predecessors with what they’ve described as a hymn of gratitude. “Desolation’s Flower,” the opening title track of their new album, is simmering and righteous. Coley’s obliterating, fuzz-slathered, single-note guitar melodies echo alongside Maria’s massive and gradual percussive crash. From that foundation, they build to multiple movements of feverish drumming and soaring black-metal riffs. Coley’s screams suggest anger, but instead of unleashing pure rage, their words express gratitude for their forebears and a promise to live in their example.“Holy are the names,” they repeatedly insist, of those who withstood the relentless hell of oppression to find a hidden world of reprieve. Their symbolism evokes the 19th-century Romantics, offering an indelible image beyond the confines of this music: “They found desolation’s flower.” As the song winds down after eight minutes, each of Maria’s evenly spaced bass drum thuds lands like a firm, persistent reminder. In both its gradual climb and its focus on forebears who cleaved through volatile terrain, the song provides the sonic and conceptual groundwork for the entirety of their sixth album, Desolation’s Flower.The seven tracks on Desolation’s Flower splice panoptic frenzy with near-ambient calm to underscore the present fraught moment in history where oppression is written into law. Ragana’s anarchist politics have carried through as the conceptual undercurrent to all of their records to date, and that continues here. In their lyrics, the metaphorical ecosystems of the world are all freezing cold, dense fog, untenable fires, and brutal winds. It’s a setting that breeds desperation and intense longing. “There is no return to a place before pain,” Coley reveals on “Winter’s Light Pt. 2.” The best way to survive out there is together; the duo recently discussed how easy it is to find community and connection through protest. “May we find shelter in what remains,” the song concludes.For all its heft and darkness, Desolation’s Flower is never full-on bleak. The emphasis on collective strength, on reaching out when everything seems hopeless, is a call to action when crumbling feels like the default. It’s there in their lyrics, and there’s also something intrinsically motivating about this Pacific Northwest queer anarchist black metal duo’s shredded vocals and raw, slow-building sound. Even the way the album is put together mirrors it’s focus on finding power through solidarity: Coley screams and plays guitar on all the odd-numbered songs, and for the rest, they sit behind the drums while Maria takes the lead. Ragana have spoken about consciously balancing their individual styles on their records—Coley’s more elaborate odysseys next to Maria’s quieter and more minimal compositions—and that melding of aesthetics keeps Desolation’s Flower riveting.",Metal,8.3
672,"Flanked by a close circle of collaborators, hip-hop experimentalist Ishmael Butler takes a brief, mysterious trip through rap aesthetics past and future. Ishmael Butler once likened influence to a vortex. Time, he said, doesn’t move linearly like an arrow, but “goes around like a whirlpool, where things are picked up and moved around but they may appear in the same place that they appeared earlier or later.” He pointed to Lil B, who championed hip-hop fundamentals like freestyling and dancing around the same time Butler and Tendai Maraire formed Shabazz Palaces, as an example of this coiling chronology. But it applies to Butler as well. The futurism of Shabazz Palaces has always been interwoven with the past and present, their songs scintillating tapestries of old-school shit talk, proggy psychedelia, and melodic flossing. Robed in Rareness is draped in this multiplicity as Butler and a team of close collaborators swagger across eras of rap.The seven-song record is the third Shabazz Palaces project without Maraire, who left the group sometime before 2020’s The Don of Diamond Dreams. The production, helmed entirely by Butler, is icier and more metallic without Maraire’s rhythmic touch; the arrangements don’t swell, contract, and glow as intensely as those on Lese Majesty or the Quazarz. But that muted palette fits the cool, nocturnal mood. Though there’s still plenty of Shabazz Palaces’ signature chaos percolating within the beats, from the distorted moans drifting through “Binoculars” to the spacey sound effects stardusted across “Scarface Mace,” the music largely brings to mind the calm of a club’s backroom. There’s a party happening a few feet away, but this particular crowd is happy to kick it in private.Butler rolls deep, tapping features for all but one song. Geechi Suede of Camp Lo, Colorado Springs’ O Finess, and Butler’s mysterious signee Lavarr the Starr, with whom he co-released an album in April, are among the guests, their disparate styles reflecting the music’s eclectic mix of punchlines, flexes, and cosmology. Butler leads the pack, gamboling through his verses like a hurdler. “I’m in my smooth phase/The L’s, they L me like Cool J/How could I fugaze?/The gangsters they hear me and shoe gaze,” he raps on opener “Binoculars,” his voice compressed into a fizzy warble. “Of the jiggy OGs, I’m the president,” he says with pride on “Woke Up in a Dream,” a collaboration with his son Lil Tracy. Butler charmingly calls Tracy his “idol,” a nod to their familial bond, and to his multidirectional understanding of time.He really is a rap time traveler. There’s no parasitism or trend-chasing desperation to the trap hi-hats and Auto-Tune vocals on “Cinnamon Bun,” on which his cadences strangely evoke Father and Chavo. The haunted beat of “Scarface Mace” brings to mind the cinematic loops of Roc Marciano and Alchemist, and could easily slot into a Griselda release. I doubt these are conscious reference points, though. Butler is a true lifer, the pursuit of new sounds as intrinsic to his style as sounding fly. The ease with which he shifts directions and shuffles through time keeps the album engrossing, even though the guest verses lag Butler in terms of skill. Robed in Rareness is ultimately a less significant Shabazz Palaces release, but there’s something fitting about a casually adventurous album by a vet dropping in the year of hip-hop’s 50th birthday. As the doomsayers look backward, Butler turns his gaze everywhere.",Rap,7.1
673,"The San Jose band’s second album is a collection of gnarly emo epics that spotlight the underbelly of being a touring musician. Life on the road may seem like an escape, but for awakebutstillinbed’s Shannon Taylor, in between sweaty gigs is ceaseless asphalt upon which to project one’s own disillusionment. “All the things I used to love before/How come they don’t feel like anything anymore?,” Taylor wonders on the San Jose emo band’s second album, chaos takes the wheel and i am a passenger, spending yet another night sleeping on the floor in a strange city. After years of failed starts in various bands around the Bay Area punk scene, Taylor found herself living what was once her dream with the success of awakebutstillinbed’s debut album, 2018’s what people call low self​-​esteem is really just seeing yourself the way that other people see you, but discovered the complicated truth that achieving her goals could only stave off depression for so long. The emo epics on chaos aim a floodlight at Taylor’s inner demons, channeling diaristic despair over riffs that zoom by like yellow highway lines under passing headlights.As Taylor journeys ahead, numbed by her neverending itinerary, she meets shadowy characters who magnify her sense of estrangement. On “airport,” she recounts her life story to a stranger on an airplane, feeling an uncanny detachment from the drunken adolescent she used to be: “I couldn’t connect to the person I was describing/As if I, long ago, wasn’t me.” When she plays a show, the people she encounters are a balm, until they’re just another person to lose: “clearview” opens during a tour date in Missouri, where Taylor meets a fan who soon after passes away. She mourns by taking this tragedy with her as she performs: “Every chord I strum/You'll always be there.”The band’s raw, expository lyrics are accompanied by a gnarlier sound. On last year’s split EP with Ohio screamo band For Your Health, Taylor opened with a screeching cry, and her voice only got harsher from there. On chaos awakebutstillinbed push even further into the red, carving scorched-earth melodies through Taylor’s battered bleats. The band’s original lineup—save for bassist Ally Garcia, who gets a quick shoutout on opener “bloodline”—worked with producer Joe Reinhardt (Hop Along, Algernon Cadwallader) and engineer Jack Shirley (Deafheaven, Joyce Manor) to build towering catharsis around Taylor’s words. The sprightly, chiming guitar tones of their debut are largely gone, replaced by dense walls of distortion and clear-eyed finger-picked guitar. Taylor too leans into the darkness; her clean vocals always threaten to crack open into a piercing howl.",Rock,7.8
674,"On her second album about environmental catastrophes in her native Kazakhstan, the London-based composer turns her attention to the radioactive legacy of the Semipalatinsk Test Site. Deep in the steppe of northeast Kazakhstan, at the foot of Degelen Mountain, stands a monument bearing an inscription in English, Kazakh, and Russian: “1996-2012. The world has become safer.” These words commemorate the successful containment of stores of plutonium and enriched uranium that had been abandoned in a maze of underground tunnels throughout the Semipalatinsk Test Site, the U.S.S.R.’s answer to Los Alamos. From 1949 to 1989, the Soviet Union conducted 456 nuclear tests in a region that came to be called the Polygon, exposing hundreds of thousands of nearby residents to fallout and irradiating the soil for miles around. After the dissolution of the U.S.S.R. in 1991, Kazakhstan became the first country in the world to voluntarily surrender its nuclear capability. The secretive 17-year operation to secure the site is one of the most crucial projects since the Cold War to safeguard against nuclear proliferation.Yet the decades-long story of the Polygon—now a destination on the dark tourism map—continues. Even today, the people of the region suffer from cancer, birth defects, learning disorders and other maladies—effects of radiation poisoning that can persist for generations. The issue remains largely unknown in the West, which lends an urgency to Galya Bisengalieva’s interpretation of the history of Semipalatinsk on Polygon. In her role as violinist and leader of the London Contemporary Orchestra, Bisengalieva has collaborated with Radiohead, Actress, Frank Ocean, and the National and appeared on the scores for Phantom Thread, You Were Never Really Here, and Suspiria. But on solo projects like 2020’s Aralkum, which focused on the shrinking of the Aral Sea due to Soviet irrigation projects, she has translated the geopolitical crises of her native Kazakhstan to a wider audience. Polygon portrays the grandeur and desolation of the Kazakh countryside, offering both an elegy and a protest for its forgotten victims of the nuclear age.Having trained in rigorous Soviet schools from a young age, Bisengalieva has said that she wants “to reimagine the violin,” to vault her own boundaries and discover new sounds with the instrument. Though Polygon features few elements—mostly violin, voice, and traditional Kazakh instruments, along with slight electronic manipulation—she produces a vast array of effects that lend these tracks the depth of a fully realized film score. Their titles describe the setting: album opener “Alash-kala” refers to the name of Semipalatinsk from 1917 to 1920, when it was an autonomous region and Kazakhstan’s cultural center. Waves of gentle ambient sound recall wind rushing across the steppe as crystalline notes sweep overhead, suggesting the rugged beauty of the landscape. “Polygon” depicts the fate of this landscape with an insistent thrumming beat and tense layers of strings—she says that she multi-tracked as many as 40 detuned violin parts—leading inexorably to a chorus of haunting voices. Suddenly, they are cut off; after an anxious delay, a percussive boom sounds in the distance and the beat is replaced by shuddering trails of static.",Experimental,7.4
675,"Taylor keeps her re-records very close to the originals, but five previously unreleased songs add depth and context to what was then her galactic, career-shifting pop debut. For Taylor Swift, 2014 might have felt like one long debutante ball. On her fifth album, 1989, she emerged as a pop superstar, platinum coursing through her veins, Victoria’s Secret models flanking her like groupies, and a jewel-encrusted microphone permanently affixed to her right hand. For the first eight years of her career, she had been known for her intimate, open-hearted songwriting. On 1989, she traded in six-minute open letters and vivid diary entries for songs that were bright, punchy, and dramatic. It was her “first official pop album,” as she herself put it at the time (dubstep drops on 2012’s Red be damned), inspired by the decade of her birth but totally contemporary in its single-minded pursuit of chart domination and Grammys supremacy.The gambit worked: Your aunt who only listens to Whitney Houston probably bought 1989; the guy who thinks his indie records are much cooler than yours definitely told you it contained “some really well-crafted pop songs” on a Tinder date once. The album yielded five Hot 100 top 10s, including three No. 1s, and hovered in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 for its entire first year of release. Behind Adele, it was the best-selling album of 2015. And it crystalized an image of Swift that she hasn’t been able to shake off over the intervening decade: that of an invulnerable, sweetly Machiavellian pop deity, arranging her music and the world around her with equal precision.1989 (Taylor’s Version), the fourth entry in Swift’s series of re-recordings, goes some way toward fleshing out this chapter in her career. The “vault” tracks packaged with the Taylor’s Version series range from astonishing (“Nothing New”) to feeble (“Castles Crumbling”), and while the five songs added to 1989 (Taylor’s Version) lack the wallop and precision of the album proper, they also sometimes reveal humanizing depth—the equivalent of seeing a star exhale and slump their shoulders the minute they step from the afterparty into the Escalade. Toward the end of “Now That We Don’t Talk,” a glittering catwalk-stomper shot through with the bitterness of Speak Now’s “The Story of Us,” Swift basically positions the poise and shine of 1989 as a way to cope: “The only way back to my dignity/Was to turn into a shrouded mystery.”If 1989 lacks some of the texture and nuance that defines her best work, the vault tracks can be encumbered by their wordiness. On “Suburban Legends,” Swift writes in the dense, largely rhymeless run-on style that defines later records like Folklore and Midnights. The second verse builds to the lines, “I am standing in a 1950s gymnasium/And I can still see it now”—an unwieldy contrast to the appealingly quantized bounce of 1989 cuts like “How You Get the Girl” and “Style.” But this messiness can yield the kind of bittersweet gems that are Swift’s specialty: As ever, she excels when channeling the cocktail of victimhood and superiority that foments in the aftermath of a breakup. On “Now That We Don’t Talk,” she tells an ex that “from the outside, it looks like you’re trying lives on.” “You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor,” from “Is It Over Now?” is an instant addition to Swift’s already-heaving canon of perfect last words.",Pop,7.7
676,"The multi-hyphenate singer-songwriter’s second album, densely packed but light as a feather, explores life and the many leaps of faith required to truly live it. Richard Bach’s popular 1970 allegorical novel Jonathan Livingston Seagull tells the story of a seagull cast out from his flock for daring to challenge their worldview by flying beyond the clouds. Along his solitary journey, he finds ways to channel his sense of isolation into self-actualization; he eventually ascends to another realm, one where ostracized gulls like himself soar across the sky in peace and serenity.“Jonathan L. Seagull,” a standout track on singer, songwriter, and producer Sampha’s second album, the meditative Lahai, ponders the forces that keep us tethered to the reality of life on Earth. “Seasons grow and seasons die/How high can a bird ever fly?” he sings, as if to literally uplift the listener. The production becomes airy and buoyant as Sampha alternates between his usual rich tenor and a breathy, piercing falsetto.There has always been something transcendent, almost spiritual about Sampha’s music, like listening to someone invent their own type of prayer. He name-checks our avian protagonist once more on “Spirit 2.0”, Lahai’s lead single and its crown jewel, where honey-toned synths and skittering drumbeats craft an ambiance halfway between Erykah Badu’s R&B mysticism and the pop experimentation of mid-career Björk. “Just like Jonathan Livingston Seagull/Try catch the clouds as I free fall,” he sings, until realizing that he is ripe for salvation: “Love gonna catch you/Spirit gonna catch you, yeah.” In comparison to the rest of the album, the production on “Spirit 2.0” is sparser, more intentional in its empty space, mirroring the resignation that comes before having to take a leap of faith.Transcendental seabirds aside, it’s no wonder that Sampha relates to these themes of alienation, individuality, and transformation. His 2017 debut album, Process—which won him the Mercury Prize and made him an R&B powerhouse after years of collaborating with superstars like Kanye West, Drake, and Solange—was written and recorded in the wake of losing both his parents to cancer. On the other side of the type of world-shattering grief encapsulated in Process songs like “(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano” lies an emotional expansion, a psychological release when those heavy emotions finally give way to something new; Lahai celebrates that transition.Another major factor between Process and Lahai is the birth of Sampha’s daughter in the spring of 2020. The newfound optimism deftly woven into this record clearly comes from an artist who has recently and suddenly shifted their perspective on life and love. “Can’t Go Back” is built upon a hypnotic loop of Sampha singing the song’s title, punctuating driving breakbeats that push the track into quasi-IDM territory. Amid the pulsing beat, Sampha is aware that his daughter is “heaven-sent,” and that whatever the circumstance, he now has no choice but to move forward, never looking behind him.",Pop,7.0
677,"Prince’s hip-hop-influenced ’90s comeback is the subject of a new box set that offers fascinating insight into a prolific, if uneven, period in his career. Once upon a time, there was a Prince who was so powerful that he could write a hit song on command. It happened when he was making his watershed 1999 album. In Alan Light’s Let's Go Crazy: Prince and the Making of Purple Rain, the artist’s former manager, Bob Cavallo, recalled telling Prince he was missing a first single for the set. Two weeks later, the guy came back with “1999,” which would become one of his signature songs. Same goes for Purple Rain. The movie’s director, Albert Magnoli, told Prince that he needed a track to play over a mid-picture montage, tying its themes together. The next day, Prince handed him “When Doves Cry,” another signature and his longest running No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.It happened again with Diamonds and Pearls. Ahead of the 1991 release of a major comeback for one of the titans of ‘80s pop and the unveiling of his new band the New Power Generation, suits in the Black-music department of his record label, Warner Bros, weren’t hearing a lead single for R&B radio. Prince disagreed but he took the weekend and came back with “Gett Off,” a pummeling interpretation of new jack swing that contained a string of slick pick-up lines—some rapped—from Prince and the promise of “23 positions in a one night stand” from N.P.G.’s in-house rapper Tony M. It became a No. 6 R&B song, and its orgiastic video portraying an HR nightmare of a dance audition lived in heavy rotation with the persistence of a vibrator that summer on MTV.“Gett Off” was a perfect single, and not just because it reoriented Prince in a hip-hop context while sounding both fresh for him and the genre. It also sported the radio-friendly ambition that guided the album it previewed. Diamonds and Pearls was tailored to be a success. “He wanted a big—capital B-I-G—pop record,” Marylou Badeaux, former Warner exec in the promo department, recalls in one of the extensive essays in the new Diamonds and Pearls Super Deluxe Edition, a package that’s almost as big and heavy as a tombstone (at least on vinyl). The album was a shot at regaining chart relevance after flops like 1988’s Lovesexy and 1990’s Graffiti Bridge album and movie. Prince engaged in an “uncharacteristic sweep of industry showcases,” according to the zine Uptown, and even deigned to speak to journalists.The early ’90s was a time when many veteran Black acts who had, to one degree or another, been accused of ignoring their Blackness and their Black audience, made a concentrated effort to prove that chatter wrong. Whitney Houston hooked up with Babyface and L.A. Reid on her third album, 1990’s I’m Your Baby Tonight, and Michael Jackson had Teddy Riley co-produce roughly half of 1991’s Dangerous. This was all before the R&B craze that would find marathon runs at No. 1 from the likes of Boyz II Men—but it was just before it. For Prince’s part he incorporated samples, loops, and raps and… hired a band, which was actually not very contemporary-R&B of him at all. But he was Prince. It was always going to be at least a little weird and he was going to do his damnedest to make it work. The album spawned both R&B and pop hits and went double platinum. It contained his strongest string of singles since Purple Rain, including the regal title track; “Insatiable,” the perfection of his quiet-storm aesthetic; and “Cream,” which is so simultaneously self-affirming and horny that it’s as close to autofellatio as any Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 ever got.",Pop,7.8
678,"Synth-rich and emotionally ambiguous, the producer’s new instrumental LP meditates on nostalgia for the sound of terrestrial radio in the 1980s. It was an eBay purchase that pulled DJ Shadow out of a pandemic slump: a trove of some 200 tapes’ worth of broadcasts recorded from a Baltimore and Washington, D.C.-area radio station in the 1980s. Novel yet stuck in time, their blend of dance, R&B, and early hip-hop triggered nostalgia without feeling overly familiar. On his latest LP, Action Adventure, Shadow homes in on a related aesthetic, importing an underground hip-hop ethos into the most expensive studio money could buy—in 1983. Whether with an MPC or a DAW, he remains a world-class drum programmer, and the beats here balance vintage luxury with slick modern production value. The synth space lasers and electronic drums on “Time and Space” sound clean and classic; the drums and melody on “Ozone Scraper” are basic but richly textured. The total effect is like a 4K remaster of an old film’s 35mm print, its fine grain beautifully rendered in high resolution.The art and business of sampling have evolved significantly in the 30-plus years since DJ Shadow started making music. By the time of his first releases in the early ’90s, cratediggers were already starting to chop up and manipulate samples beyond recognition; by the end of the decade they had perfected the art of burying them in the mix, layering dozens of pieces of audio like camouflage. Shadow’s 1996 masterpiece Endtroducing… carries the distinction of being recognized by Guinness as the first album constructed completely from samples. But in 2023, the landscape looks much different; digital tools make identifying samples easier than ever, and publishing unlicensed material can create a legal time bomb.The samples on Action Adventure, rather than providing a wealth of material from which to create a collage, feel like calculated choices, hyper-specific triggers that help set the tone for the songs. The rambling riff and scream from Dust’s 1971 hard rock jam “Loose Goose” provides the jump-off for the high-octane “Free for All,” a raucous bruiser that could easily pass for a Run the Jewels instrumental. A line from Loudon Wainwright III’s 1986 folk ballad “Expatriot,” about a man leaving home, becomes the centerpiece of “All My,” a blistering ode to crate-digging that would feel right at home at a Chicago footwork party. And he’s still capable of finding salvation in the stacks, pulling an inspired vocal performance from Jan Jerome’s obscure 1990 R&B B-side “Baby, Got Me Goin” to build the stunning new jack swing track “You Played Me,” with a bassline that could give a twentysomething Teddy Riley a run for his money.",Electronic,6.9
679,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit a 1987 goth rock masterpiece, a dramatic and winkingly macabre record from the mind of a man who thought it was all sort of a joke. The Sisters of Mercy were pure evil right from the jump. Their sound was so identifiable, so simple and evocative, that it formed its own strand in the DNA of goth music. After a run of increasingly well-crafted singles and EPs, the Leeds band’s 1985 full-length debut, First and Last and Always, crystallized this identity: a drum machine that plinked like icicles dripping on a cave floor; warped guitar riffs that seemed beamed in from ’60s psychedelic rock; menacing basslines that were as memorable as the guitar parts; lyrics of alienation sung in a vampiric yawn that could seduce and mock and yearn.Where do you go next? Fire the whole band. Bring on Meat Loaf’s songwriter and the guitarist who shredded on “Addicted to Love.” Incorporate a 40-person choir and a climactic sax solo. Write a piano ballad about childhood. Treat the drum machine so that it sounds like Rocky hitting the punching bag. Shoot an expensive video in the desert so that the Sisters of Mercy look like rock gods, wandering the earth in search of a sweeping vista to suit their newfound ambition.On paper, Floodland should be a polarizing cautionary tale: an act of hubris that rejects the humble, visionary qualities that endeared a loyal audience to an underground, artsy group of misfits. Instead, it’s the masterpiece that defines them. Andrew Eldritch, the band’s sole remaining member by the time of its release in the fall of 1987, was driving himself nuts poring over demos alone in his adopted home of Hamburg. Driven by a burning desire to prove himself—and to propel his story beyond his old friends and new nemeses—this album had to be a grand gesture. Something undeniable.An auspicious turning point for a band that started as a joke. “A very, very, very, dry joke,” Eldritch clarified to an interviewer in the early ’80s. His idea back then was to embrace the most ridiculous aspects of strung-out rock showmanship and marry them to music so exasperatingly bleak that it formed a meta-commentary on making art in an inhospitable world. The sense of humor came through their sulking covers of unlikely songs—say, ABBA’s “Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)”—and their occasional insistence on style over substance. Here was a band who crafted their own logo and merch before ever recording a song. (“I thought T-shirts were the key to this,” Eldritch reflected in 2019, “and I have not been proven wrong.”)Of course, Eldritch’s self-deprecation was always part of the act, and the truth was that the Sisters of Mercy were significantly more talented and devoted than they let on. Their live shows were emotionally draining, and their recordings were meticulous and full of atmosphere: a sound often imitated but never matched. And yet, it’s the songwriting that helped distinguish them from their peers. Breakthroughs like 1983’s “Temple of Love” showcase Eldritch’s studious attention to the structures and melodies of the classic rock era while expressing the necessary gloom to fit in with the post-Joy Division post-punk boom.",Rock,9.1
680,"N/A Wong Kar-wai’s feverish and charming 1994 romantic drama Chungking Express features the director’s greatest needle drop: The vibrant guitar riff of the Cranberries’ “Dreams” leads into a Cantonese cover by singer and actor Faye Wong that spills open over a montage of her character, a snack-bar worker who daydreams of escape, replacing every memento of a love interest’s ex with tokens of herself. The line between Wong, the performer, and Faye, the character, is already shaky—both possess a boyish, offbeat cool—but the former’s cover version mirrors the latter’s intention to assume another’s place. The guitars burn a bit brighter and the drums fold a little flatter, and though Wong adjusts to a convincing echo of Dolores O’Riordan’s warble and yodel, her voice sounds a touch more refined—her delivery similar, yet never quite identical.Wong, who would later become heralded as the “queen of Cantopop” and also establish a noteworthy Mandarin discography, frequently reimagined other artists’ work in the early period of her career. After she signed to Cinepoly in 1989, the label held her to the standards of Hong Kong’s Cantopop; her early albums sandwiched uninspired renditions of Japanese and American hits between treacly adult-contemporary ballads. Adapting foreign hits in Cantonese had become a reliable method of generating mainstream success in Hong Kong, yet hints of a more innovative approach were audible in covers like Wong’s take on “Dreams.” Wong’s final four albums for Cinepoly, newly reissued on vinyl, showcase the maturation of her voice as well as her deepening desire for artistic freedom as she embraced idiosyncratic sounds and themes of escapism; they trace her evolution from competent copyist to singular talent.In an interview, Wong pointed to the malleable nature of the voice as an instrument, and hers constantly morphed alongside her changing interests. After becoming dissatisfied with the direction of her career, she traveled to the U.S. for vocal lessons and demanded greater creative control upon returning. Subsequent releases between 1992 and 1993 showcased a heavy flair for R&B, with full and brassy tones, before she pivoted into pop-rock, her voice strained and willowy on covers of the Police and Tori Amos. In 1994, Wong embraced a more alternative sound with 胡思亂想 Random Thoughts—the parent album for her popular Cantonese “Dreams” cover—and ventured further afield with a pair of covers of Scottish dream-pop pioneers Cocteau Twins that closely recreated their style, Wong bending to match Elizabeth Fraser’s rolling trills.While those records emulated Wong’s wide-reaching influences, 討好自己 Please Myself, her final album of 1994, sharpened her artistic identity. Up to that point, her covers had been faithful to the point of imitation, but here, Wong’s version of the Sundays’ “Here’s Where the Story Ends” offers a glimpse of her own vision. More dream than jangle, the cover flips the specificity of the original’s bittersweet narrative into a relatable lovesick sigh, and as Wong’s voice rises over the rattle and shimmer of the guitars, it sounds clear, bright, and full of infatuation. The rest of the album dresses Wong in a similar palette of dazzling dream pop and fond adoration.",Pop,7.4
681,"The Peruvian producer’s debut album is a shimmery collection of protest chants, club rhythms, and sunlit synths that testifies to dance music’s spiritual nourishment. The ecstatic house music of Sofia Kourtesis suggests places that are full of people, but not necessarily crowded. Think of a time when you were closely surrounded by more heads than you would normally tolerate, but it wasn’t a problem, and actually made your environment that much better. On her debut full-length, Madres, Kourtesis invites us inside every version of this space that she knows. That includes, but also extends far beyond, the transcendent dancefloors that she summons through her enraptured, hair-on-fire performances. Madres travels from intimate nightclubs in Berlin to sunny beaches on the Spanish coast to booming demonstrations on the streets of Lima. It’s a rich collage of foraged samples that beg to be rewound and heard anew, a dance album that will jolt you with jumper cables, and a stirring statement on maternal patience in its many possible forms. Madres fulfills the promise of Kourtesis’ string of effervescent EPs and exceptional remixes over the past five years.With her eye for texture, Kourtesis practically drops you into the middle of these gatherings—sometimes through field recordings culled directly from those scenes. But it’s her meticulous composition style that heightens the album’s sense of bounty. On the title track, gentle synths splash and scatter like thick sunshower drops on a windshield, vocal arpeggios loop into an angelic backing choir, and a door hinge creaks in distress. Kourtesis eventually sighs a tender and glowing refrain, introduced by the song’s crown jewel: a grainy, vintage sample of a nasal voice yelping a mysterious broken phrase, calling out from beyond. She treats the sample like it’s a torn-off corner of an old photograph: damaged and decontextualized, then reframed and reconsidered.MadresThat approach pays off most of all on the clamorous protest track “Estación Esperanza,” which features her lifelong role model and the first musician she ever saw in concert, Manu Chao. When Kourtesis released “Estación Esperanza” as a single nearly two years ago, it illustrated her noisiest side, clanging like an old radiator warming up—and in the context of Madres, it’s ripping hot. Alongside chants from a Peruvian anti-homophobia protest, Kourtesis dices up and echoes a rhyme that Chao repeats throughout his 2001 album Próxima Estación: Esperanza The line—“¿Qué horas son, mi corazón?”—could be interpreted as a parent asking a child for the time, or a personal mantra, or nifty nonsense. Chao named his album after its recurring sample of the Madrid metro intercom announcing Esperanza station; written out, the words appear to say “Next Station: Hope.” But Kourtesis takes a page from Chao’s book and spins the title into a rallying cry: Here, “Estación Esperanza” could be read as “Hope Season.” Her gift for pulling new meaning out of aged audio fragments is one of Madres’ foremost delights.",Electronic,8.5
682,"The UK electronic musician used neural networks to wring synthetic voices into strange, unintelligible shapes. The results are by turns funny, poignant, and frightening. Lee Gamble’s Models is a cold, sad, wispy album whose songs are like ghosts trying to communicate their unfinished business, unable to puncture the barrier between their plane of existence and ours. The seven tracks on the UK producer’s new album don’t just deconstruct pop music; they obliterate it, leaving unmoored vocal bits gasping and choking in dead air, as if separated from their parent songs and starving for oxygen. There’s something curiously touching about these twitching, disembodied songs; you almost want to pick them up and try to put them back together again.There’s not a single actual human voice to be found across the record’s 32-minute runtime. Instead, Gamble assembled an arsenal of synthetic voices, which he then fed through neural networks that scrambled the syllables beyond recognition. At times, the results resemble human language, as when “She’s Not” repeats its title over and over like an overzealous trained parrot. Others are pure generative gibberish. Once you realize which pop song Gamble is atomizing on “XIth c. Spray”—hint: it’s an early hit by an American pop star whose last name rhymes with “spray”—the contrast between familiar melody and alien language becomes funny, poignant, and frightening. You almost feel sorry for the artificial voice as it performs the function it was created to perform, endlessly and unthinkingly, with no comprehension of how ridiculous it sounds.Gamble’s production feels just as incorporeal as the voices. Composed of endlessly circling rave melodies and chord progressions that lead nowhere, it harkens back to the ambient jungle deconstructions on his 2012 album Diversions 1994-1996 and conjures the same feeling of cavernous emptiness. His productions may not be composed by AI, but they don’t exactly sound human either, with “Purple Orange” daringly disappearing into silence in its opening seconds. (Many listeners may find themselves checking their volume settings.) Even unmistakable nods to Hyperdub labelmate Burial on “Juice” and Boards of Canada on “Blurring” feel less like references and more like errant bits of cultural detritus that Gamble just happened to scoop up while digging, WALL-E-like, through a post-apocalyptic wasteland. The album’s one moment of stunning beauty—a wash of Ashra-like guitars at the beginning of “She's Not”—seems totally divorced from the rest of the music here, which proceeds from such inhuman logic that the idea of “beauty” seems as foreign to it as it would be to a crocodile.Yet there’s something reassuring about Gamble caressing AI for its flaws. The existential concern around AI stems largely from its potential to displace work and money from actual creatives; to a lesser extent, the technology raises questions about expressive authenticity: How much of an artist’s soul comes through in music generated by an intelligence beyond the artist’s control? Gamble deals with this problem by using AI in a deliberately inhuman, even ridiculous, way and calibrating his production to match it. He has compared the voices to Elizabeth Fraser, whose unintelligibility has become a meme, but even at her most inscrutable, you could usually suss out what the Cocteau Twins singer was feeling. With the strange quasi-intelligence that stares back out of this music, it’s anyone’s guess.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

683,"On his latest album, Jack Tatum incorporates newly vulnerable songwriting into his ’80s dreamworld. On May 25, 2010, Brooklyn’s Captured Tracks released a pair of homespun debuts by bands whose re-interpretations of first-wave indie pop would help spearhead a wave of millennial DIY nostalgists. Since then, Beach Fossils and Wild Nothing have charted parallel paths: Both followed their debuts with a studio-grade sharpening of their sound, then pivoted to baroque songcraft with vintage electric keys and saxophone solos. Following a joint tour celebrating the bands’ 10th anniversaries, their respective frontmen each settled down to start families before returning this year with unusually personal albums that re-examine their past work through the lens of fatherhood. Beach Fossils’ Dustin Payseur returned to his surf-pop style on June’s Bunny; Wild Nothing’s Jack Tatum finds new meaning in his dreamscape on Hold, emerging with some of his most touching tracks to date.Hold was written shortly after both the birth of Tatum’s son and the onset of the pandemic. The inability to tour or book studio time, coupled with the parental learning curve, forced him to reconsider his priorities—a shift that’s reflected in the exploratory nature of his new work. In contrast to the distinct aesthetics of 2016’s Life of Pause and 2012’s Nocturne, Hold adopts a refreshing sense of whimsy. Self-producing for the first time since 2010, Tatum dabbles in one-off genre experiments, toys with eccentric lyrical devices, and embraces a maximalist ethos that sets this album apart.Loosening up Wild Nothing’s sound also allows Tatum to peel back the obscurity of his lyrics. On “Pulling Down the Moon (Before You),” the Peter Gabriel-inspired closer, he indulges in a newfound sentimentality, describing the renewed purpose he’s found in fatherhood and the anxiety that comes with it. “A whole existence I can hold/But won’t ever weigh me down,” he sings, reverb-gated snares and delayed lead guitar echoing all around. His vocals nudge to the front of the mix, a deluge of psychedelic effects highlighting the vulnerability in each word.The most gripping moments dissect Tatum’s insecurities with surreal, self-deprecating humor. “Suburban Solutions,” inspired by his move from Los Angeles back to his home state of Virginia, second-guesses the desire for domesticity. He pictures his new setting as an ironic advertisement for the bourgeois lifestyle, soundtracked by a chintzy array of synths. “Take a big bite,” he commands in the cartoonishly pitched-down voice of a commercial announcer. Where dreams once represented escapism in his music, the subconscious now feels occasionally antagonistic. It’s strange to hear a Wild Nothing track to adhere so tightly to a concept, but Tatum grounds the material in his trademark stuttering rhythm guitar and booming motorik beats.When Tatum returns to dreams, he seems eager to wake up. In “Histrion,” he recounts a familiar nightmare: standing in front of an audience and forgetting every word. (In the final verse, a crane hoists him offstage.) Bolstered by warbling Auto-Tune, he belts with unprecedented abandon, slamming piano chords and wailing in a Todd Rundgren falsetto to amplify the ecstasy. This ability to surprise is Hold’s greatest asset. After dabbling in Eno-esque ambient sounds, straight-ahead shoegaze, and baggy beatcraft, Tatum lets the layers of nostalgia overlap when “Dial Tone” calls back to that old, breezy jangle circa Golden Haze, a time when Wild Nothing’s ’80s revivalism set a new benchmark for bedroom pop. He can still rekindle its magic on cue.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

684,"The Brooklyn singer-songwriter makes being a loser sound lush with textured, self-deprecating songs that land like punchlines. On A Little Touch of Schleicher in the Night, Katie von Schleicher is a luckless harlequin on a velvet stage, showcasing an array of indignities against a luxe backdrop of strings and woodwinds. She’s a clown; a loud talker making faux pas; a deadpan underdog. Like Harry Nilsson on A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night, she makes being a loser sound lush, teetering between cheeky, aggressively charming pop and dreamy balladry.The Brooklyn singer-songwriter’s latest album is more acerbic than 2017’s Shitty Hits and 2020’s Consummation, the pay-off, perhaps, of writing classes taken during a lean period without a booking agent or a plan. “Honestly my tight five needs work,” she confesses on opener “Montagnard People,” but the songs here delight like a series of clever, well-timed punchlines. Her candor makes her a protagonist worth rooting for. “When you’re mourning the past/You’ll remember your ass,” she sings, recalling lapsed advice to take nudes while she’s still young and hot. She snoozes the alarm under a heap of pillows and suffers from week-long migraines. “I wear becoming like a burlap sack,” she says on “Elixir.” Somewhere between Faye Webster and Eleanor Friedberger, von Schleicher delivers her sermon from inside a conversation pit, sunk deep while the hubbub transpires a few feet away.The quips are the album’s most noticeable gems, and they shine all the more inside such atmospheric production. A Little Touch of Schleicher in the Night is an excellent attestation to von Schleicher and collaborator Sam Griffin Owens’ direction: Every song sounds textured and multifaceted, with steady builds and decrescendos that juxtapose joy with the comedown. The arrangements—a menagerie of saxophones, clarinets, and violins with the jaunty bounce of guitar chords—walk a tightrope between the schmaltz of a Herb Alpert record and the evocative swell of Brenda Lee’s “Emotions.” It succeeds as party music, the kind that starts jubilantly and lapses into wine-drunk silence. Although occasionally, like on “Bottle It,” von Schleicher slows down the tempo and risks killing the buzz.The album is not all joyless rides and parties, surfacing raw anxieties about failure and being left behind. But it finds solace in revelry: “Tonight I’m a dancer/I wanna feel alright/There are a million worries, I know,” she sings on “Elixir.” If time and existentialism comes for us all, the best we can ask for is a picture of our ass at 25 and a pop song on the radio while we languish on a California highway. A Little Touch of Schleicher in the Night gilds indignity with glamor, a winsome paean to shiftlessness and melancholy.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

685,"JT and Yung Miami strive to regain their spot as the dirtiest, most provocative hitmakers in rap. The title of the new City Girls album is a shocker: RAW aka Real Ass Whores. It’s an attempt to convince the music world that their X-rated anthems of tricking and scamming haven’t lost any edge just because they got real professional in the three years since City on Lock. In that time, Yung Miami, who chants like New Orleans bounce and Miami bass pioneers of the past, settled into the role of talk show host with Caresha Please, an occasionally raunchy and often therapeutic interview series designed to make her the next rapper-turned-mogul. JT, the more hardened rhymer, transformed into a Vogue It Girl, with more appearances at runways than on rap songs. They’ve intentionally steered their image away from the Miami fast life and closer to Vivica A. Fox’s businesswoman in Two Can Play That Game.As this transformation was taking shape, the City Girls' lawless, horny, club-hopping escapades became a living mood board for the next generation. It’s not out of pocket to say that Sexyy Red’s Hood Hottest Princess, arguably one the biggest mixtapes of the year, wouldn’t have been able to flourish like it did if the duo’s 2018 album Girl Code hadn’t come before it. But who wants to be discussed like musical relics? The City Girls sure don’t. Throughout RAW, they’re on a mission to regain their spot as the dirtiest, most provocative hitmakers in rap.Too bad they sound too splintered to get there—I wouldn’t be surprised if a chunk of RAW was recorded while Miami and JT were in different cities. They don’t feel like they’re on the same wavelength nearly often enough. Most of the standout moments go to Miami. Her verses are always rich with carefree personality, like how she erupts over the hushed beat of “Line Up” for a few of the most emphatic bars on the album: “It’s just somethin’ about a nigga who put money in a brown bag/Ooh it turn me on like a light switch.” That “ooh” sounds like she’s panting in the booth. Then on “Show Me the Money,” over a flip of Rebbie Jackson’s “Centipede” so fly that you could imagine it in the hands of turn-of-the-century Hov, Miami’s shifty-flowed flexing does Trina on “Nann Nigga” about as well as anyone except Trina herself.JT isn’t quite an afterthought, but it sometimes feels like she’s clocking in. Her solo track “No Bars” is supposed to be her close-up, and the thudding Michigan-style beat makes you believe that she’s about to black out. Instead the song is pretty tame, full of clean-cut bars about which brands she would like to be sponsored by. (“Got bitches tannin’ for this dark skin” is a good one, though.) There’s a little swag to her opening verse on the Magnolia Shorty-interpolating “What You Want,” even if it’s quickly upstaged by Miami going for broke: “Fuck them kids, I’ma swallow that jit.” As a unit the City Girls are at their best when JT is the core and Miami is the wild card. That’s the case with “I Need a Thug,” a twist on LL Cool J’s “I Need Love.” The way JT rips into her verse (“He walk in parties and you know the sticks is up/I walk in parties and you know the dicks is up”) allows Miami to act more like Freaknik host.",Rap,6.8
686,"On their spectral new album, the Oakland musician explores the promise of connection and the terror of the past. Since the 1980s, teams of engineers, anthropologists, and other specialists assembled by the U.S. government have attempted to warn us about nuclear waste repositories. A field known as nuclear semiotics was developed around the challenge of relaying danger in the distant future when our existing modes of language might become obsolete. One proposed method was creating a “spike field,” or demarcating a hazard zone with giant, ominous granite prongs jutting from the ground at odd angles. This unshakeable image struck Maria BC, whose overcast music explores the complexities of human communication, the promise of connection and the terror of the past intruding.On their second album, Spike Field, they balance raw beauty and digital destruction. They recorded it at a family friend’s home in San Francisco instead of their cramped Brooklyn apartment, and the album’s languid, widescreen sound reflects a newfound sense of space. Listening to Spike Field is a paranoia-inducing experience: all eerie ambience, punctuated with unexpected moments that are small but explosive. A melodic guitar line will reverse without warning, an acoustic squeak will jump from the mix, and an out-of-tune Steinway will dissolve into oblivion. Those glitches play like brain zaps, momentary electrical pulses that alert the senses even at the record’s most serene. There are moments of reprieve, like the fog lifting on the soaring chorus of “Mercury,” but it takes wading through the murk to get there.What ties everything together is Maria BC’s mezzo-soprano, a lilting, trembling guide through the wreckage. After adopting a hushed tone in their early music to avoid disturbing their roommates, the classically trained singer gets to display their full range as they sort through old, unresolved memories. “Return to Sender” dwells on a lost connection with a friend who went through a psychotic episode; “Still” expresses an ambivalent relationship to a younger self. “You’re looking good now, double crossing every line still/In the blue light of my mind,” they sing. These are blurry snapshots that Maria BC explores by stretching out every detail to the edge of comprehension. On “Watcher,” they regret being a bystander to someone’s pain, chanting the words “I saw” as harmonies from Dear Laika and G. Brenner accentuate the angst.In these songs, we hardly know the specifics; disembodied thoughts are charged with emotion but devoid of context. On “Haruspex,” Maria BC invokes an ancient Roman practice that involves inspecting the insides of sacrificial animals. “Is my body right?/A pound of flesh/A dime for the haruspex,” they sing. The impressionism of the lyrics precludes easy understanding, but the unsteady terrain is what makes Spike Field intoxicating. The tension between abstraction and emotional intensity comes to a head on “Tied,” a song that shifts from dissonant guitars to hopeful, major-key melodies with cello accompaniment from MIZU. Spike Field is a lonely record, but it demands close listening for the moments when the light breaks through.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

687,"Loosely keyed to a story of Hollywood hedonism in the ’70s, the second album from William Basinski’s dance-pop project taps into the teeth-grinding edginess that follows a euphoric high. William Basinski shares a few traits with the late director William Friedkin. The two artists—who both have answered to the nickname “Billy”—have created prolific bodies of work while moving gracefully between disparate genres. Like Friedkin, Basinski has become bolder while growing older, letting his hair down on playful releases that contrast with the somber drones he is known for. In 2020, right around the time that he moved from NYC to the palm-lined streets of Los Angeles, the revered ambient composer upset listeners’ expectations with a new dance-pop project, Sparkle Division. Collaborating with electronic artist Preston Wendel—who records solo as Shania Taint—Basinski pulled out his saxophone and his sense of humor on To Feel Embraced, an album of fizzy filter-disco concoctions.Three years later, the group—now augmented by new member Gary Thomas Wright—returns with Foxy, ushering in the teeth-grinding edginess that inevitably follows a euphoric high. The album’s deconstructed disco maintains many of the elements of Sparkle Division’s debut—schmaltzy exotica strings, moody piano chords, noir-jazz standup bass—but a specter of evil now lurks in the shadows. On To Feel Embraced, choppy samples and looping vocal snippets made the duo’s soft-focus songs sound more like Eccojams than Jam City, but uch of their harder-edged sophomore effort is propelled by hectic breakbeats, while Basinski’s sax blurts continually, providing the only constant in a panoply of genre explorations. Beatless fantasia “The Punch!” offers the closest link to his drone works, sinking into a morass of bell-like tones that reverberate across nearly nine minutes.As the carefree hedonism of the 1960s’ free-love bubble was burst by the Manson Family murders at decade’s end, parties in the Hollywood Hills took on a nightmarish quality. Foxy is guided by a loose narrative set in that historical moment that gives the eight songs their titles and structure. A note on the album’s Bandcamp page spells out the album’s characters and trajectory: “gorgeous young interns,” a drug dealer named Foxy, drinks spiked with LSD25. “Have Some Punch” and its reprise “We Were There” bookend the album’s path from rising tension to bad acid trip, but there’s still plenty of fun to be had along the way.The stomping drums and late-’80s production touches of Foxy’s title track initially bring the attitude of “What Have You Done for Me Lately” until silky synths glide into the chillout room. After the album’s vaporous centerpiece, “The Punch!,” drum’n’bass rhythms teased out in previous tracks are shoved to the front of “Oh Yeah!” If it wasn’t for Max Kaplan’s tenor sax, this airy banger could be mistaken for the soundtrack of an N64 snowboarding game. By the time they reach the liquid beats of “Slip and Slide,” the two musicians are riding the faders in a way that suggests a Boiler Room Session loosened up by a tray of bellinis; the chipper “We Were There” wraps it all up in a deranged, dissonant bow. Like the taut three-act structure of a Friedkin film with an ambiguous ending, Foxy stays compelling until the finish.",Electronic,7.5
688,"The New England rapper celebrates the joys of gaming on a bright and bubbly collaborative album. Devin Bailey, the rapper, producer, and singer who records as Pink Navel, has an effervescent and nasal voice, an extensive knowledge of animated television, and an immense, somewhat intimidating pool of references and SAT words. Thankfully, the term “nerd” no longer stings like an insult—these days, it’s more like a term of endearment. On the charming How to Capture Playful, Pink Navel teams up with Los Angeles producer Kenny Segal to celebrate nerdom with joyous raps that revolve around their enduring love of video games.In games, Bailey finds a way to process the intricacies of existence and as well as a place to disappear when life gets too overwhelming. “I’m thinking that a game can make the pain stop,” they rap on “Cracked,” sounding almost surprised to admit it out loud. Little moments here and there indicate how deeply the subject is woven into Bailey’s life. They play anytime they have to wait in line (“Memory Card”); they sit all day with the controller in their lap, poised to respawn at a moment’s notice (“Reset”); they estimate that their hours of screen time stretch well into the triple digits (“Synergy'').Gamer life can be isolating, but Bailey doesn’t wallow in darkness or escapism. While they occasionally question the space their hobby takes up, they also relish the wonder and meaning it provides. In “Maps & Navigation,” which is ostensibly about in-game cartography, Bailey ruminates on what it is to be present, how following a set path may not take you where you need to be. In “Present Vendor,” they rap glowingly about Beedle, the merchant who appears throughout The Legend of Zelda series, transforming him from a bit character to a working-class hero. Beedle could be the friendly bodega clerk who remembers your usual order or the postal worker who keeps the line moving efficiently.Kenny Segal responds to Bailey’s whimsy with an equally spirited palette. The beats are a far cry from the ramshackle doom jazz he provided to billy woods on Maps, instead feeling more akin to the pastoral instrumentals on his 2018 solo album happy little trees. He supplies Bailey with shivering psych-folk flutes (“Speedrun”), distorted 8-bit jazz (“Hours Played”), and lush loops (“Poet Gang Playing Cards”). Each track feels bright and slightly over-caffeinated, goofily stumbling over itself to create space for Bailey’s infinitely unspooling rhyme schemes.Pink Navel’s complex writing and dexterous command of rhythm reflect their immersion in the music. Listen to the way Pink mimics the bassline on “New Tech” before pivoting to a syncopated staccato that mirrors Segal’s sporadic needle-drop sampling. Their triple-time cadence on the washed-out drill of “Solving Combat” tumbles over the insistent hi-hats, finding nooks and crannies between the kick drums. They make a Cones of Dunshire reference, rap about scrolling TikTok while hiking, and say “IRL” unironically—but they make it sound cool. Bailey’s passion is the joyful heart at the center of this record. Even if you’re not a gamer, it’s easy to get swept into its bright, pixelated world.",Rap,7.4
689,"Reuniting after a decade, ex-Abe Vigoda members Michael Vidal and Juan Velasquez make a welcome return to sighing, swirling guitar and dusky post-punk ambiance. In 2010, the scrappy Chino punks in Abe Vigoda shared a producer with Beach House, tour dates with Vampire Weekend, and a cinematic ’80s revivalism with the year’s buzziest bands. With its hyperkinetic “tropical punk” draped in Pretty in Pink pastels, Crush was the most commercially appealing album to emerge from Los Angeles DIY venue the Smell and, therefore, the biggest challenge to its egalitarian philosophy. But whether Abe Vigoda were truly going for the gold was a moot point: They quietly disbanded a year later and Crush remained a hidden gem that sounded like nothing else. At least until now, as Michael Vidal and Juan Velasquez reunite as Cupid & Psyche on the alluring Romantic Music, sounding like “the next Abe Vigoda album” but with a sober, measured perspective that required another decade to access.While Vidal and Velasquez are still mining the more populist sounds of Thatcher-era post-punk, Romantic Music isn’t going to be confused for “sophisti-pop.” The duo’s musical complexity feels born more of intuition than finicky craft, one sighing guitar line weaving into another, leaving just enough space for Vidal’s unorthodox, diffuse vocal melodies to braid through. With the exception of the engrossing chorus of lead single “Angels on the Phone,” the hooks don’t arrive through seismic dynamics or a belted melody, but rather slight nudges that lift the curtain on the uniformly dusky mood; witness the piquant chord changes in “Anxiety’s Rainbow,” or a slight shuffle in the rhythms of “Datura Sketch.” Romantic Music is at its best when its core sound inches into the ’90s and decks itself out in greyscale paisley, as if the Cure revisited their Faith-era gloom while trying to reckon with the melon-twisting rhythms of Madchester.The reliance on drum machines lends Romantic Music a more era-specific sound than Crush, though also one that’s less distinctive. Whether it’s the nature of the project as a pandemic-born jam session or the just the inevitable result of starting over without a rhythm section, Romantic Music lacks the feverish momentum of infatuation or devastation, too often locked into a muted, narrow range of timbre and tempo.While Abe Vigoda’s tropical punk roots invigorated this often ossified aesthetic, Cupid & Psyche do so from a more subtle and lyrical standpoint. Vidal’s actual vocal range is somewhat limited, but his voice is an emotionally expressive instrument: Every longing note carries a yearning for a new world and the promise of a glimpse of it, the very dynamic that has drawn American audiences to this style of music for the past 40 years. Yet Romantic Music has practical aspirations for tangible and spiritual connection in the present. The somber production underpins the foundational contrast of light and dark energies—anxiety is a rainbow, serenity a pit—though the synths and reverb tend to gloss over Vidal’s more touching turns of phrase, scrutinizing the false allure of the internet or empty nostalgia. On the opening title track, some of that scrutiny appears directed at Abe Vigoda itself. “It takes time but you’ll get over/Reasons why we won’t make it,” Vidal croons, perhaps skewering a past version of himself, one that truly believed “I’m gonna change your life with my music.” Instead, from its word and deed, Romantic Music is the exact thing its humble origins promised, a labor of true love.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

690,"Inspired by traditional music and an ancient mystery, French producer Julien Hairon creates buzzing, digitized dance beats that iterate endlessly on themselves. Producer and ethnomusicologist Julien Hairon has spent the past decade wandering the Eastern Hemisphere, collecting field recordings from indigenous groups. In Cambodia, he witnessed the Kreung community play a polyrhythmic gong piece during a harvest ritual that involves feasting on a sacrificial cow. In Tanzania, he lived among the Maasai, who invited him to record the traditional music of a circumcision ceremony. Hairon releases these recordings via his Les Cartes Postales Sonores label, and reissues other CDs and tapes found during his travels—to Indonesia, Australia, China, Bangladesh—on the PetPets’ Tapes imprint.But for Sator Arepo, Hairon’s debut as Judgitzu, he found inspiration closer to home. He became intrigued by the Sator Square, a five-word Latin palindrome. Versions of the puzzle, which dates back to ancient Rome, have been found in Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Its exact meaning is unknown, but from the middle ages into the 19th century, such squares were believed to have magical properties. The acrostic—which includes some formation of the Latin words Sator, Arepo, Tenet, Opera, and Rotas—was chiseled into stone to ward off illness, evil, and even raging flames. On Sator Arepo, Hairon reinterprets the circularity of palindromes, crafting digitized, rapid-fire dance beats that circle and distort.With a modest arsenal—an Elektron Digitakt sampler and sequencer, a Yamaha PSS-50 keyboard, a Critter & Guitari Organelle, and a Microkorg—Hairon recycles song structures and hints back at his own beats and synth sequences. He reconfigures frenetic digital drum patterns and stretches out drones summoned from the Organelle. The basslines cooked up on his Microkorg throb like a jugular vein pumping blood. This self-referential closed loop mimics the limited set of letters contained in a palindrome, seeding each new song with a trace of the previous one. Hairon mutates the sounds slightly with each rotation, but the whole of Sator Arepo plays like a cohesive barrage of rhythms meant to induce trance-like state.Tactile details make the tracks more distinct, even when they appear to have been erected from similar blueprints. On “Sylphe” and the title track, Hairon seems to coat the drums in lacquer, giving them a plasticky clack. The percussion on “L’Or des Fous” (“Fool’s Gold”) feels both plastic and metallic—like a ping-pong ball ricocheting off pots and pans. Hairon manipulates non-rhythmic elements with the same precision; “L’Or des Fous” is threaded with foghorn-like synth pusles and a gnawing buzz that evokes a giant fluorescent tube. The dark, mechanical “Vitalimetre” is powered by shrill synths that sound like a souped-up dental instrument.",Electronic,7.1
691,"Using electric mandolin, electrified violin, pedal steel, and snare, the Baltimore group’s music tilts bluegrass and Western swing toward raga and drone; it’s both avant-garde and compellingly listenable. The 19th-century folk song “Arkansas Traveler” is as much a part of the Southern landscape as kudzu, red mud, and humidity. Its melody, which has been borrowed by everyone from Charles Ives to Raffi, is simple and playful; you can picture someone playing it on a banjo in a Les Blank movie as easily as you can imagine hearing it spilling from an ice-cream truck’s speakers. Where some songs of its era command a gravitas that makes them feel brittle as parchment, “Arkansas Traveler” can be pulled like taffy in a Gatlinburg candy store window. Some might call it kitsch. But judging by the way they play it on their debut album, Salmon Graveyard see “Arkansas Traveler” the same way John Coltrane saw syrupy tunes by Jerome Kern and Johnny Mercer or Rodgers and Hammerstein: as a high-art gem that just needs a little polish.Salmon Graveyard is the project of guitarist and electric mandolinist Corey Thuro, a regular in the Baltimore and D.C. improvised music scenes who has collaborated with Matmos’ M.C. Schmidt, among others. The music he and his band play is, in a sense, a countrified form of raga, long improvisations over phrases that repeat relentlessly. Drones have figured in American folk music for centuries—you can probably follow the hum of an open-string fiddle back to the Highlands bagpipe—and artists like Henry Flynt and Pelt have long used bluegrass instruments to make stridently, uncomfortably avant-garde music that’s still recognizably within the lineage of Bill Monroe or the Carters. While Salmon Graveyard are willing to take their explorations to challenging places, the plucky swirl of John Hoegberg’s pedal steel and the nonstop march of Jonah Guiliano’s snare give their music a glossy cosmopolitan feel that has more in common with Western swing. Think of it as Bob Wills gone free jazz.That approach makes Salmon Graveyard unique in their musical realm: They are fun and easy to listen to. You can dance to them. Thuro’s distorted mandolin and Alani Sugar’s electrified violin wrap and tangle in “Arkansas Traveler,” squeezing the song so hard Hoegberg starts picking his bass like he’s playing hardcore, drawing out harmonics, playfully trying to push the song back open. It’s sprightly in a somewhat neurotic way, like it’s been up for two days, all black coffee and trucker speed. “Peak Bottom,” meanwhile, kicks off the 26-minute two-part composition that forms the center of the album with a long, slow whistle from Hoegberg’s pedal steel, the sound of a bomb dropping in a mid-century cartoon.",Folk,7.6
692,"The classic Blink-182 lineup reunites to huff the fumes of their best material. Blink-182 have always been living on borrowed time. “I wish that Earth clock/Could often just be stopped,” Tom DeLonge sang on the 1993 demo Flyswatter. To trace the band’s obsession with aging through their discography—“Lemmings,” “What’s My Age Again?,” “Good Old Days,” “Blame It on My Youth”—is to trace the journey from arrested development to desperate self-delusion. Their Peter Pan syndrome is an act of self-preservation: The absurdity and vanity of youth are the generative forces of pop-punk, a genre built on dick jokes and being mad at your parents. For a band like Blink-182, aging—or acknowledging it—would be tantamount to admitting defeat. And so, night after night, fans participate in a collective fantasy that Mark Hopppus is still 29 years old and thinks it’s funny to sing about elderly incontinence (admittedly, it slaps live). Disbelief became harder to suspend in 2021 when Hoppus was treated for stage 4 lymphoma. With the threat of oblivion breathing down their necks, Hoppus, DeLonge, and drummer Travis Barker—who had not recorded together since 2012’s surprisingly affecting Dogs Eating Dogs EP—returned to the studio to cement their legacy. The resulting album, ONE MORE TIME…, clamors with the frustrated energy of a band too engrossed in its own mythology to innovate on the form it helped create.Blink-182’s inward collapse had already begun on 2019’s NINE, their last record with Alkaline Trio guitarist Matt Skiba, where they quoted their own hits on songs like “Blame It on My Youth.” On ONE MORE TIME…, they don’t even try to couch nostalgia with in-jokes. Take album opener “Anthem Part 3,” the capstone to the trilogy of 2001’s “Anthem Part Two” and 1999’s “Anthem.” It starts with a guitar and drum pattern nearly identical to “Part Two,” establishing an uncanny valley of sentimentality that lingers throughout the album. It’s a lazy shorthand for the time lost between releases, a suggestion that if you close your eyes, you too can be transported back to the Mark, Tom, and Travis of 2001. “Work sucks/I know” was transcendent in its minimalism. Here, they feel the need to spell things out explicitly: “When your job has gone to deep shit/If you’ve fallen off of that list/When you’re clenchin’ both of your fists.” Blink-182 have a lot more to say, even if they’re not saying anything.Since their last full album as a trio, 2011’s Neighborhoods, the most perceptible shift in the Blink-182 dynamic has been the emergence of Barker as a pop-punk svengali, paving the rap-to-rock pipeline for artists like Lil Huddy and Machine Gun Kelly. His overstuffed, cheap-thrills approach to production—starting with drum fills that occupy every inch of breathable air—has seeped into Blink-182’s empty hooks. “Dance With Me” (after Tom’s intro, which made me miss the days of old Blink) channels Machine Gun Kelly’s unrelenting onslaught of guitars and nasal screeching. Whereas previous albums were primarily written by the band members, ONE MORE TIME… adds a bevy of songwriters, including Kelly collaborator Nick Long and OneRepublic’s Ryan Tedder. It feels disjointed and bloated, not to mention heavily indebted to the band members’ existing discography. “Terrified,” originally written for Barker and DeLonge’s side project Box Car Racer, is almost identical to the sound of that band’s biggest hit, “I Feel So.” “You Don’t Know What You’ve Got” strips the haunting guitar riff from “Adam’s Song” for parts, just different enough that you might miss it at first. When they run out of their own material, they turn to their inspirations: The cloying “Fell in Love” opens with a synth line based on an interpolation of the Cure’s “Close to Me,” which could have felt inspired if it didn’t force such unflattering comparisons to the old Blink song actually featuring Robert Smith, 2003’s sparse and subtle “All of This.”",Rock,5.2
693,"The daughter of sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar has spent years exploring the instrument’s possibilities. Recording in Berlin with Arooj Aftab and Nils Frahm, she zeroes in on the nexus of music and memory. Over the past 25-odd years, Anoushka Shankar and her sitar have carved a wide, idiosyncratic path through the landscape of Hindustani classical and contemporary pop music. The daughter and protege of sitar virtuoso Pandit Ravi Shankar—hippie icon, the world’s best-known Hindustani classical musician, and the “godfather of world music”—she spent the late ’90s and early aughts perfecting her grasp of Hindustani classical sitar, releasing three albums of strictly traditional ragas that showcased her precocious virtuosity on the instrument (she made her solo live debut at just 13). Then, much like her father, she began to venture further afield, writing and performing music that more accurately reflected a life lived across three different continents.On 2005’s Rise, she re-imagined the sitar as a thoroughly modern instrument, weaving it into a patchwork tapestry of jazz, pop, flamenco, and Asian Underground electronics. She followed it up with 2007’s Breathing Under Water, a collaboration with Karsh Kale that blended her elegant sitar and piano with his glitchy, jungle-laced tablatronic soundscapes. There would be experiments with flamenco (2011’s Traveller, produced by Javier Limón) and chopped-up hip-hop (M.I.A. collab “Jump In,” off 2016’s Land of Gold), all part of Shankar’s quest to “de-exotify” the instrument.Now 42 years old, with nine Grammy nominations under her belt, Shankar is firmly established as the 21st century’s most innovative sitar player. Her father’s shadow, long as it is, has receded, and with it the immense pressure to live up to her name. She’s now confident enough to turn her gaze inwards, writing music from a space of vulnerability that she rarely afforded herself before. The 2020 EP Love Letters—written after the dissolution of her marriage with English filmmaker Joe Wright—seethed with anger and heartbreak, eschewing her complex, densely layered compositional style in favor of sparse arrangements for cello, piano, and sitar. Compared to the artfully assembled bricolage of her earlier work, Love Letters sounded almost organic, a natural accretion of harmony and rhythm.Shankar pushes further into this new direction on Chapter I: Forever, for Now, the first of a planned trilogy of “mini-albums”—she’s already in the process of mixing the next one. Each EP is meant to be an intimate snapshot of a particular instant, with Shankar as a Rothko of the sitar, painting expressionist scenes in blocks of vibrant color (serendipitously, raga literally translates to “color” or “hue” in Sanskrit). The first chapter’s genesis lies in a lazy summer afternoon spent in the garden with her two young boys: A half-forgotten lullaby emerges from subconscious depths, a melody that carries with it phantasmal memories of similar scenes playing out across generations.",Folk,7.2
694,"The Los Angeles multi-instrumentalist improvised alongside his partner while she illustrated on paper; together, they’ve created an audiovisual album bursting with bold lines and vivid colors. Sam Gendel seems determined never to walk the same path twice. In little over a year’s time, the Los Angeles-based composer and multi-instrumentalist has released a sprawling collection of hybrid jazz and hip-hop experiments, an assemblage of plaintive Japanese-inspired fusion, and a cover album of molecularly disassembled R&B classics. In his quest to aggressively remake himself, Gendel has also become a prolific collaborator with musicians running the gamut from accomplished record producers to his partner’s 11-year-old sister. When Gendel works with others, it’s typically his creative vision that guides the project’s shape, but on his latest album, he’s surrendered to the imagination of his partner, visual artist and filmmaker Marcella Cytrynowicz.AUDIOBOOK was devised as an audiovisual collaboration: Cytrynowicz drew the project’s illustrations while Gendel improvised alongside her in real time on a Suzuki Waraku III, a decades-old electronic koto instrument. Cytrynowicz’s art acts as a graphical score for his spontaneous compositions, lending them a scattered quality as Gendel’s eyes follow along the images’ labyrinthine contours. The basic building blocks of each piece are textural rather than musical. On the opening “AB,” a percussive puff skitters erratically over a swell of synthesizer, as if repeatedly slamming into a wall and rerouting its path. As it transitions into “CD,” the outline retains its shape but slowly expands as bite-sized blasts cut in. Each track is titled alphabetically in pairs from A to Z, and they flow as smoothly from one to the next as a memorized run through your ABC’s.Cytrynowicz’s drawings, which have been compiled in a book accompanying the vinyl release, as well as a downloadable PDF and online multimedia presentation, make use of bold colors and tight curves, and Gendel leans into the elemental energies they evoke. You can almost feel the heat of his breath on “KL” as streams of air blown across his reed weave into the fabric of the track. “GH,” in contrast, is draped in muffled echo, as if the sound waves were traveling along the ocean floor. On “EF,” twinkling synth tones glint like beams of light hitting stalactites in an icy cavern. Plucky percussion and a noise like flowing liquid punctuate “QR,” bringing to mind a rushing white river. Gendel adds an additional dimension to his partner’s imaginary landscapes, lending them a powerful sense of place.Some moments feel more underdeveloped. There are interesting wrinkles in the wobbly synth and washboard percussion of “WX,” but it never quite coalesces into the evocative imagery found elsewhere. “IJ,” a cover of saxophone virtuoso Wayne Shorter’s “Deluge,” strips the piece down to its essentials and leaves it barely recognizable. Gendel’s at his strongest when layering up melodic phrases and letting them play off one another, as on standout “UV.” He plays as if he’s trying to charm a snake, nimbly running up and down scales while a cavernous, shuffling beat keeps time. He paints expressive strokes with his synthesizer, matching the lively peaks and valleys of the artworks that Cytrynowicz was creating by his side.

695,"The Knife producer returns with his first major solo release in over a decade, a giddy, slippery EP that explodes into the sunlight. Between 2008 and 2010, the Knife’s Olof Dreijer—under the alias Oni Ayhun—released some of the freakiest dance music that this century has yet to produce. On eight untitled tracks spread across four cryptic 12""s, he veered between clean-lined techno and squalling white noise, slow-motion industrial and beehive drones, folk melodies and shards of shrapnel—sometimes all within the span of a single 15-minute track. Then, having carved his iconoclastic mark across a stagnating European techno scene, he went dark, at least as a solo artist. Beyond his work in the Knife, he put out little beyond the occasional remix or collaboration.But in recent years, Dreijer has gotten busier. He has produced a few rising artists (as well as a handful of tracks on his sibling Karin’s last album as Fever Ray) and remixed a few more; earlier this year, he and longtime collaborator Mt. Sims put out a beguiling ambient-adjacent record made entirely using Trinidadian steel drums. Now he returns with Rosa Rugosa, his first major solo release since 2010. The EP’s three tracks are, in one sense, textbook Dreijer: He’s still using the same eerie, pitch-bending synth riffs and jittery arpeggios. But a distinct shift has taken place. Where Oni Ayhun’s records felt like they emanated from some demonic dungeon, Rosa Rugosa comes exploding into the sunlight.All three tracks feel like variations upon a single theme: They’re all in the same key, and their side-winding melodies feel like funhouse-mirror reflections of one another. The title track sounds the most like Dreijer’s previous work, punctuating a lean, snapping drum groove with staccato synth stabs that hark back to some of Carl Craig’s floor-filling anthems of the mid ’00s. The syncopated lead takes the high-strung energy of a song like Fever Ray’s Olof-produced “What They Call Us” and dials up the nervousness; bright and colorful, it dances like a butterfly caught in a gust of wind, whipped around by tight spirals of echo. It might take a number of listens to realize just how minimalist the song actually is: There are almost no drums, save for a steady kick and some slippery shakers, yet every inch of the spectrum bursts with kinetic energy.Dreijer is clearly influenced by contemporary African and Afro-diasporic electronic music; his recent collaborators include artists from Tunisia, Morocco, Sudan, and South Africa, and his DJ mixes are peppered with the sounds of kuduro and batida. Those influences come to the fore on the EP’s other two tracks, with their loping log-drum rhythms. “Cassica,” like the title track, is mostly empty space, with a mosquito synth lead buzzing drunkenly through a dappled canopy of glancing chords and quivering accents. “Camelia” might be the most ebullient thing here, and not just because the drums are a riot of dizzyingly syncopated rimshots and crash cymbals. The synthesizer melody positively sings, imbued with an expressive sensibility I associate with virtuoso R&B vocalists; that might be due in part to the peculiar qualities of the synth patch, which feels like a strangely organic hybrid of woodwind, brass, and wordless voice. As the song crests toward its high-flying climax, it transmits an unmistakably giddy sense of joy. Whatever its echoes of other contemporary global dance-music styles, it couldn’t be the work of anyone but Olof Dreijer. Fifteen years since the first Oni Ayhun record, he’s still in a class of his own.",Electronic,7.7
696,"The gloomy new album from British rapper, DJ, and now filmmaker Mike Skinner echoes but doesn’t equal the narrative force of the Streets’ classic material. If the rave life hadn’t claimed him, Mike Skinner would have made a pretty good screenwriter. There’s always been a filmic quality to the Streets’ music: laddish but insightful rap that paints slice-of-life tales so vivid and relatable they made Skinner a folk hero for a certain breed of sensitive geezer. But The Darker the Shadow the Brighter the Light is an actual movie. Though there’s been a smattering of Streets activity over the last few years—a handful of releases, a guest-packed mixtape—Skinner calls this the project’s first official full-length since 2011’s Computers and Blues. It only exists, he says, because of a feature-length film of the same name out now in UK cinemas—a “noir murder mystery” set in London clubland that Skinner wrote, directed, produced, funded, edited, and even acted in himself.After putting the Streets on ice in 2011, Skinner set out to explore other musical avenues, plying his trade as a club DJ and putting his name to collaborative projects like the D.O.T. and Tonga Balloon Gang. Even the title The Darker the Shadow the Brighter the Light began as an alias, used to release a string of fresh tracks on SoundCloud from 2016 onward. For all this creative restlessness, all roads ultimately led back to the Streets, and perhaps that’s not surprising. Skinner’s voice is immediately recognizable and remains singular: a softly monotone English drawl that plays subtle tricks with rhythm and assonance as it weaves its tales of rickety love affairs and late-night misadventure.Intentionally or not, The Darker the Shadow the Brighter the Light points to past Streets landmarks. The laggy synths of “Troubled Waters” feel like a queasy flashback to “Blinded by the Lights.” “Too Much Yayo” trembles with the post-bender anxiety that powered The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living. Longtime collaborators Kevin Mark Trail and Robert Harvey pop up to croon the hooks. At times the callbacks feel deliberately self-referential, but over the long haul they give the sense of a project that has long since staked out its boundaries.Skinner’s penmanship remains intermittently fantastic. He still has a talent for a good one-liner (“Behind every great man a girl rolls her eyes,” he deadpans on “Funny Dream”) as well as deeper meditations on the human condition, told from the perspective of a mid-40s hedonist who’s burned through more serotonin that most. “Troubled Waters” is the key track. Its nocturnal feel and occasional surge of d’n’b rhythm locate it in the club. But the mood is grim as Skinner muses on sin and redemption: “Is it nature or nurture when you hurt your bredrins?/We pray in church for our personal heaven.”",Rap,6.0
697,"The rapper tries to reinvent himself with his second solo album, showing off impressive range while getting hampered by personality-free songwriting. Offset was always the black sheep of Migos. The Atlanta rapper was in jail at critical moments during the group’s rise, and before their blockbuster album Culture, he rarely handled hooks or opening verses. “Lost everything I had like Solomon,” he reflected on 2015’s “First Day Out,” and his music has never shaken that desperation for redemption. He raps like an athlete who was benched by an injury during a championship run, determined to make up for his absence and prove his talent. So on his solo debut Father of 4, he distinguished his music from Migos’ by ballasting the group's gaudy and ecstatic swag rap with wounded soul-searching.For his second solo effort, Offset attempts to lean further into his de facto pariah status. “I’m Michael, I’m not no Jermaine,” he says on single “Jealousy,” signaling a grand transformation with nods to the king of pop’s Off the Wall era. Hammering home the point, he rocks Jackson’s “Smooth Criminal” and “Thriller” costumes in the video for “Fan,” and he bears a single white glove on the album cover. In Jackson, he sees a blueprint for reinvention. “I just feel like Michael felt: wanting more creatively, challenging myself to be a better and bigger artist, and to leave the old stuff in the past,” he told Sharp.In theory, such a reset is needed. By the time Migos released Culture III, they were approaching music like a legacy act, clinging to old flows and familiar concepts. Few surprises or delights lurked inside that record’s litanies of luxury goods and twisted syllables, and the guests frequently outshined the monotonous hosts. Even before last year’s fatal shooting of Takeoff forever changed the future of the group, Quavo and Takeoff’s decision to form a separate duo—one that largely stuck to the Migos formula—put pressure on Offset to succeed on his own. But despite his overtures to rebirth and new horizons, he remains a creature of habit.On a technical level, Offset is in rare form. He’s a finesser who can strut, slide, and stutter-step across virtually any beat, a versatility that is foregrounded when he’s alone. These songs never feel as busy as Migos songs, even when Offset is constantly switching direction, as on the flow clinic “Big Dawg.” But there’s a glaring lack of purpose and personality to the songwriting. Offset spends the record narrating a life of decadence, fashioning himself as an A-list star with deep pockets, exquisite tastes, and a legion of paramours—subjects that are all Migos mainstays. While bits of charisma and vulnerability occasionally filter in, as on “Say My Grace” when he mourns Takeoff and his grandmother, these moments are overwhelmed by constant mentions of G6 flights, Chanel, and diamonds clear as water that would make for a punishing drinking game. Offset was by no means an open book on Father of 4, but the intimate theme gave his songwriting and performances direction. The concept here is essentially, I rap by myself now.Offset’s not a bore, so his agility and the range of sounds keep the album somewhat pleasurable. To avoid retreading the gilded trap of Migos and the brooding laments of his first album, he went beyond core collaborators like Southside and Metro Boomin, who both contribute just one song. The rest are sourced from stalwarts like Wheezy and Boi-1da, and less marquee names like Aaron Bow and Offset himself, all of whom offer idiosyncratic takes on melodic rap. Thick basslines and bits of Delta blues (“On the River”), Memphis horrorcore (“Hop Out The Van”) and gangsta rap (“Jealousy,” “Fan”), and spacey trap (“Buss My Watch”) create a mood of joyful darkness. A sense of villainous liberation guides the motion: “Night vision, I can see the opps when they hidin’,” Offset raps like a lion waiting in ambush.But the album ultimately feels like a status update, never really probing or conveying why freedom is so important to Offset. Though lines like “I would be lying if I say I ain't miss the three” and “I’m better on my own,” suggest ongoing anguish over the end of Migos and his strained relationship with Quality Control, the music doesn’t develop those feelings. If he were more of a dramatist, brooding penultimate track “Upside Down,” where he gushes in Auto-Tune about feeling his world is topsy-turvy, might have flipped all the preceding exuberance and flexing on its head. But instead, all he offers is flat repetition of the title. Sound familiar?All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

698,"The Los Angeles ambient musician continues to explore the interdependence of plants and humans, but they add new wrinkles to their placid style, shifting from easy listening to dynamic soundscaping. For proof that we all must ultimately coexist on this planet, look no further than coquina. The porous sedimentary stone forms almost entirely out of fragments of shellfish, trilobites, and other invertebrates; over millions of years, snails, urchins, and other creatures make the rock home alongside algae blooms, forming communities inside each rainwater-carved divot. Coquina lends both an opening track title and general ethos to Los Angeles musician Olive Ardizoni’s new album as Green-House, A Host for All Kinds of Life. Within Ardizoni’s ambient collage of field recordings, synth, and piano flourish idiosyncratic melodies crafted with the patient and methodical hand of a gardener.A Host for All Kinds of Life is the first Green-House album Ardizoni has made with longtime collaborator Michael Flanagan as an official partner, and it represents a maturation of the ideas introduced on Green-House’s 2020 debut, Six Songs for Invisible Gardens. The music, deconstructed new age designed as a communication between plants and those who care for them, has evolved from soundtracking individual organisms to the mutually beneficial ecosystems they create. But Green-House’s work has always been invested in biotic beings big and small, following in the footsteps of artists like Mort Garson and musicians associated with kankyō ongaku, a Japanese style of ambient sometimes translated to “environmental music.”Like kankyō ongaku, which sprang up in the 1980s in conversation with architecture and contemporary art, Green-House’s own branch of environmental music homes in on what flora and fauna might sound like behind the din of modern metropolis, almost as if a biodome started up a chamber band. Throughout A Host for All Kinds of Life, electronic elements—clean tones from Casio synths or mellotrons that form hypnotic refrains—are woven with field recordings that evoke intimate moments with the natural world, moments Green-House insists are still an intrinsic part of urban living. Even in a concrete jungle, signs of life as minuscule as the chirping of birds lift a veil of false separation between a city and its roots.Where 2021’s Music for Living Spaces played like incantations for a struggling bird of paradise, A Host for All Kinds of Life takes more interest in pauses and negative space. Moments of stillness in “Lichen Maps” are brought to life by distinctive noises like the rustling of a dried rattlesnake tail, fed through a granulator plug-in, or a deep human breath. Sitar- or theremin-like synths on “Coquina” and “Luna Clipper” ring out tentatively before growing into more complex compositions. Green-House’s measured approach means that even on songs that intertwine three or four melodies, discrete textures from foley recordings or keyboards still ring out in the background like muted bells. The details in cuts like “Coquina” or “Castle Song” build so intuitively that it’s almost as if they’re happening in secret, a thicket blossoming away from prying eyes.",Electronic,7.6
699,"Jenny Hval and Håvard Volden’s second album together rejects longform epics for pop structures—yet Hval’s songs are more elusive than ever. Lost Girls’ second album Selvutsletter opens with Jenny Hval waiting for a rental car at an airport. Planes take off and land. A bell chimes in the distance, like the ringing of a railroad crossing. Amid this buzz of transportation, Hval is sitting still, thinking. Waiting is something she’s “very good at.” A bloom of synths summons both the calm, antiseptic environment of an airport and the feeling of being trapped. Every now and then Hval lets loose an astonishing high note, flaying her voice bare with vocal fry, as if rebelling against the bloodlessness of her surroundings. But the car never comes. She vaguely resolves to cure her fear of flying, but the song ends with the singer in the same place she began, bemused by the “choreography of living.”The pleasures of the Norwegian duo’s style are all there on “Timed Intervals,” not least the thrill of hearing Hval disappear into her own mind, coming up with connections that make surreal sense (she compares the planes ascending and descending to a “creature inhaling and exhaling”). But while the 10-minute-plus epics that until now have been a hallmark of the Lost Girls project moved linearly, the songs on Selvutsletter feel circular. The nearly 14-minute “Drive,” from Lost Girls’ debut EP Feeling, also involved a rental car, but that car was actually moving down the highway, mirroring the singer’s journey into her own head. Here, one of Hval’s most memorable lyrics from “Drive” comes to mind: “I rage without moving.”On Selvutsletter, Hval and multi-instrumentalist Håvard Volden limit themselves to pop-song lengths, with only two tracks exceeding five minutes. The expansive vistas of earlier songs like “Drive” and the title track of 2021’s Menneskekollektivet have shrunk slightly, but within these relatively brief runtimes there’s a wealth of creativity. “Sea White” and “World on Fire” indulge in vast washes of cathedral organs, the latter toggling playfully between drawbars to end on an effect almost like a skipping CD. “Re-entering the City” opens caverns of space between skeletal drums and eventually dissolves into a wash of ambient sound. Lost Girls love scratchy drum machines, scratchier guitars, and huge billowing house chords that seep into songs like ominous industrial fumes.With less time per song for guided tours of her mind, Hval instead focuses on remembering or imagining how something felt a long, long time ago. She skips around in time, speaking directly to the listener, letting them know it’s 1996 or 1998—the years when Hval got her start as a performer singing with the goth-metal band Shellyz Raven. “With the Other Hand” takes us into the kind of dimly lit dive bar where Hval undoubtedly played dozens of shows early in her career, while “June 1996” plunges headlong into the era, adroitly replicating the kind of sincere and faintly grungy pop song a lot of people were making at that time. On “Re-entering the City,” she goes further back, visiting a park and “smelling” years of history. “People demonstrated here in the ’50s,” she whispers, like The Sixth Sense.",Experimental,7.8
700,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit the 2005 solo LP from the Dipset rapper, who rendered his brusque New York City experience in surreally unnerving style. Jim Jones doesn’t sound exactly like a human being. The way the Harlem rapper had begun, by the middle of the 2000s, to double his vocals was not quite a 1:1 recreation of the technique 2Pac used to summon a half-disembodied doom, no matter what little homages cropped on up on Jones’ tracklists. Nor was it in the same mold as No Limit artists like Master P or Young Bleed, who reimagined Pac’s fatalism as the tics of men too preoccupied to worry about technique. Both of those effects were achieved by drawing the listener’s ears to the incongruity of the takes. Jones’ increasingly claustrophobic records came to sound, instead, like the imperfect transfer of a muscular voice across rocky ethernet; only the most forceful notes survive.Harlem: Diary of a Summer, Jones’ second album, was released in 2005 as the stranglehold he and the Diplomats had held over New York City was beginning to loosen; as New York itself was becoming decentered within hip-hop; and as the stylistic hallmarks of Dipset’s early run—deliberately chintzy soul samples, gleefully telegraphed wordplay and onomatopoeia—were being replaced, by competitors but also by the Dips themselves, with bigger, darker, and more industrial elements. Diary of a Summer runs the traditional rap blockbuster through that filter, its childhood memories turned oddly urgent, its concessions to emerging styles bent back toward post-9/11 Manhattan. Through that process Jones, the least-discussed core member of the group he co-founded, emerges as an auteur of the ordinary, his unfussy writing and uncanny vocals rendering a world just a few degrees off from the one the rest of us inhabit.Speaking—stay with me—of 9/11: In 2001, as Jay-Z was enlisting Kanye West, Just Blaze, and Bink! to polish the soul-sample production style of The Blueprint to a high shine, Cam’ron was finalizing an agreement with his childhood friend Dame Dash that would bring him and the Diplomats to Roc-A-Fella. The quick-and-dirty approximation of “Never Change,” “Heart of the City,” and “Girls, Girls, Girls” that Cam preferred—its samples more mischievously obvious, its seams barely concealed—would help vault him and his partners to stardom. By the end of 2003, Jones, Cam, Juelz Santana et al. had not only compared themselves on record to Mohammed Atta, Osama bin Laden, and the Taliban, but had become the most popular and consequential rap group in the city. The five-volume series of Diplomats mixtapes, hosted by the late DJ Kay Slay, distilled their appeal: playful but bludgeoning, cartoon villains obsessed with little language games. Cam’s third solo album, Come Home With Me, and Diplomatic Immunity, the group’s studio debut, formalized that dominance.",Pop,8.1
701,"The indie rockers pay tribute to their heroes with a love and abandon that can only come from living with these songs for decades. The Feelies may not be the Velvet Underground’s first disciples—Jonathan Richman was there at the inception, tailing the band with the fervor of a Deadhead. But it could be argued that the New Jersey institution, led by Glenn Mercer and Bill Million, is responsible for much of the indie rock that flowed downstream from the Velvets. Crazy Rhythms, the Feelies’ 1980 debut, bristled with a confined nervous energy as the band brought the downtown innovations of the Velvet Underground to the suburbs, an aesthetic that became part of the lingua franca of guitar-pop for the ensuing decades.The Feelies’ new album, Some Kinda Love: Performing the Music of the Velvet Underground, captures a performance held in conjunction with the touring exhibition “The Velvet Underground Experience” during its New York City run in 2018. Setting up shop at the White Eagle Hall in Jersey City, the Feelies invited fellow Velvets fanatics Richard Barone and James Maestro of the Bongos to hop on stage, then proceeded to tear through a set that sidelined the avant garde escapades of the Velvet Underground to focus squarely on their strengths as a rock’n’roll band.Rightly celebrated as a key act in the birth of transgressive rock, the Velvet Underground also had a sweet undercurrent flowing through their occasionally abrasive music. Some of this can be chalked up to Lou Reed’s enduring love of doo-wop and R&B, an affection that grounded the group even as they floated far afield on waves of noise and ambience. As a band, the Feelies don’t quite share the same R&B affinity, yet they hone in on that warmth, deliberately sidestepping the ominous dread of “Heroin,” the cacophony of “Sister Ray,” and the poignant sadness of “Pale Blue Eyes” so they can play songs that collectively sound like a celebration.The Feelies favor no particular era of the Velvet Underground on Some Kinda Love, balancing selections from the group’s early years with John Cale with songs originally sung by Doug Yule, Cale’s replacement in the Velvets. It’s a holistic view of the band that places an emphasis on songs that sound great within the confines of a club. The most telling selection may be “Head Held High,” a rocker that opens the second side of Loaded—the last album Reed made with the group—and the moment where Some Kinda Love kicks into high gear: It’s a song with no higher meaning than being a real good time, which is precisely what the Feelies intend to deliver.",Rock,7.7
702,"The singer-producer explodes her sound with a feverish blend of shoegaze and bedroom pop. On Frailty, Jane Remover was a voyager sculpting her own cosmos from her childhood bedroom. A frenetic combo of emo, EDM, and idyllic video game tones, the singer-producer’s 2021 debut rendered a cyber otherworld with ultra-blue fjords and bleach-white skies. Within her insular online music scene, it soon became a touchstone. Instead of capitalizing right away, she took some time to hibernate and touch grass, embarking on a cross-country road trip. She said goodbye to the freaky mashup microgenre she dreamt up under an alter ego. She also came out as a trans woman, announcing the name Jane Remover with the release of two songs: the smoky, whimpering ballad “Cage Girl” and “Royal Blue Walls,” which starts wispy and escalates into a delicate squall that felt less digitized than her past work. On her new album, Census Designated, Jane ushers in another evolution of this shoegaze blueprint.Census Designated hits like a flash flood, following moments of dreamy calm with clattering downpours. It’s a feverish mutation of shoegaze and bedroom pop, anchored by her skills as a producer for sculpting layers that sparkle and mutate. Jane hangs in the storm like an eager specter. Instead of bitcrushing her voice or sampling stock howls like she did on Teen Week, she squeezes more from her own resources to unlock a newly expressive style. The way she weaves lattices of vocal clips and skitters between inflections—breathy sighs, elegant swoons, and desperate, ravenous screams that make her sound possessed—is intoxicating. Her curlicued melodies mirror the lyrical unease and lend baroque detail to songs like “Idling Somewhere” and “Lips.”The weather patterns on Census Designated move in distinct acts and peak with glorious deus ex sonica noise-drops. Where Frailty’s dense, shiny synths could feel like drowning in pixels, these songs are scratchier and serrated: They crush you slowly and gently. Fuse yeule’s electro-acoustic ballads, Slowdive’s bright crescendos, and the febrile anticipation of Ethel Cain’s “Ptolemaea,” and you get a song like “Video,” which strums for six minutes and then erupts with a lung-tearing scream. “Lips” begins as a willowy whisper of indie balladry. As Jane sings about being someone’s nervous wreck, a semi-acoustic loop tuned like echoing chimes shimmers against a rhythm guitar that churns below the surface. Sure enough, everything warps into an infrared, rock nightmare. Jane’s voice claws through the smoke like a ghostly dagger—imagine My Bloody Valentine commissioned to soundtrack Fatal Attraction. “Take a step back boy/I’m so afraid,” she warns. “You want crazy/I’ll give you insane.”",Experimental,7.8
703,"Speckled with guest stars and produced by Andrew Watt, the Stones’ second original album this century is a bunch of hackneyed duds, polished until the character has disappeared. Before he was the drug-smuggling, skull-ring-wearing pirate of rock’n’roll lore, Keith Richards was the Rolling Stones’ amateur accountant. A working-class kid born into mid-war England, the fussbudget immediately began documenting the band’s finances: how much they made from those early gigs (often zero), how much sessions cost (not much), and how Bill Wyman was more valuable as a guy who owned a Vox amp than as a bassist (ouch). The Stones subsequently became not just one of the world’s biggest bands but also most ostentatious—a merchandising machine with lips-emblazoned jumbo jets, rented French mansions, and outsized stadium shows. The Stones helped define rock stardom’s swaggering ethos. They also turned it forever into a big fucking business.On Hackney Diamonds—the second album of original material by the Rolling Stones this century and the first since the death of drummer Charlie Watts, the band’s bedrock for more than half a century—these titans of industry flail as they try to act their image rather than their age. Alongside producer Andrew Watt, they turn every trick they can to conjure just one more hit, one more chance to cash in. They try and fail to reinvigorate themselves in the rock’n’roll fountain of youth they helped create, only to emerge with a dozen hackneyed duds. Hackney Diamonds, named for the shattered glass left by a burglar, reinforces the worst part of the Stones’ once-aggressive outlaw image: eternal avarice.To that end, Hackney Diamonds lands right on time for the two American bonanzas for which it seems algorithmically rendered: holiday spending and Super Bowl advertising. This is exactly the sort of album you gift a middle-age, mid-divorce dad who’s flailing for direction as he speeds around town in his post-split sports car, cranking the Stones’ anti-romance rants. A petulant ex for 60 years now, Mick Jagger is so pouty about being put out here it scans as absolute arrogance. Sneering opener “Angry” is the theme song for the pops who reminds everyone how hard he’s worked, how little thanks he gets, and how he’s also, inexplicably, “still taking the pills” and “off to Brazil.”You can picture Dad pounding his hand against the steering wheel in time to “Bite My Head Off,” four minutes of punk so patrician that it takes a blown-out bass solo by Sir Paul McCartney for it to sound remotely tough. During “Driving Me Too Hard,” Jagger threatens to escape to Morocco or the corner bar, then concocts neologisms for crying, an emotionally unavailable man too afraid of these things called feelings to name them. What’s more, it sounds like the Eagles trying to be bland.",Rock,4.5
704,"Jonny Pierce’s eponymous new album reflects the characteristically sunny indie pop and increasingly inward focus of the Drums’ solo incarnation. For all the sweetness of the Drums’ music, they’ve always sounded crushed. As the leader—and now sole member—of the band, Jonny Pierce has written hundreds of spare, summery indie pop songs full of self-recrimination and self-examination. His new album, Jonny, is the culmination of 15 years of introspection. Pierce confronts head-on the memories of childhood trauma that have reverberated through the Drums’ past five albums, matching the mood with a sparer sound.Filigreed with an edge of post-punk, Jonny is full of dreamy, minimal jangle pop. The lyrics are stark, sifting through Pierce’s past and examining how it’s invaded his present. In the sunny-sounding “Isolette,” Pierce describes the incubator where he was placed after a traumatic birth. He attributes his mother’s early detachment to this formative event, and the song follows those ripples into his adulthood intimacy. “You’ll find a better lover,” he apologizes to his subject. “I’m just back in the isolette.” Across Jonny, Pierce’s lyrics are unpoetic—the album ends with the refrain “I used to want to die/But now I don’t want to die!”—but the melodies are strong enough to carry them. “I Want It All” and “Plastic Envelope,” the two best songs here, express plaintive emotions with unadorned directness.While the sound is pared back, there’s a greater variation in style, like the surprisingly grand, doo-wop-esque ballad “Be Gentle.” A Rico Nasty feature on “Dying” comes out of left field, but her voice, candy-sweet and bell-clear, blends right in; you only wish she had more interesting material to work with. Instead, the song is flat-soda synth-pop, with Pierce making a suitably uncomplex point (he’s been “dying all my life”)—a recipe that’s repeated across the tracklist. Pierce’s work has grown more insular since the Drums compressed into a solo act, and tracks like “Better” and “Pool God” feel at once bloated and shallow.Even as excess weighs down Jonny, the album still glimmers with beauty. Pierce’s depictions of raw, strange intimacy have long distinguished the band’s music, and Jonny’s core scrutiny of trauma and its aftermath plays to his strengths. As a pop songwriter, Pierce’s instincts tend toward the brief and precise. With some editing and a tighter focus, Jonny could have brought those talents to their most evocative, full-bodied expression yet.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

705,"The two Golden State rappers sound like naturals on their funky, easygoing collaborative album with New York producer Harry Fraud. Jay Worthy and Kamaiyah are both California stalwarts committed to keeping tried-and-true West Coast music alive. Worthy’s smooth, almost monotone reflections on street life tend to be couched in stately G-funk and wavy samples, while Kamaiyah’s airy dirty-macking tales usually glide over the bounce of hyphy, sounding like Too $hort with a taste for AutoTune. Both have a penchant for autobiography and fly shit, and when they get together, like on 2020’s “Bullshit” or last year’s “Good Lookin’”, they sound like naturals. It’s as though they should already have five albums and yearly nationwide tours together.Now they’ve finally released a full-length project,The Am3rican Dream, produced by Harry Fraud. Largely known for his adaptable sample-based production, the New York producer meets his collaborators halfway, offering a mix of traditional East Coast loops and sunny G-funk for their slick pimp talk. This is Kamaiyah’s first time rapping over samples for a full project, and the simmering, mid-tempo beats give her sing-song vocals room to breathe. She soars over the synth rock of “Entrepreneur.” On “Ragtop Riches,” she slinks between twinkling keys and bass as she grills a potential new girlfriend about what her sugar daddy does. The beats don’t coax her to new places lyrically, but it’s nice to hear her stunt over a different backdrop.Meanwhile, Worthy is fully in his comfort zone, telling straightforward stories about his lifestyle like a mafia don lounging in an easy chair. Every action—hitting rivals in the head with Hennessy bottles, hitting the stroll with sex workers and drug dealers—is rendered in the same amber hue, like he’s living out a movie in real time. That said, his writing lacks the specificity of fellow mack-daddy savants like Larry June or Roc Marciano. His ideas can occasionally grow stale: “Figueroa Fortunes,” where he flies solo over smooth yacht rock guitars, is just a checklist of lust, drugs, and money that sounds labored and awkward.Their styles may be different, but Worthy and Kamaiyah play off of their contrasting approaches well. Take the triumphant closer “Streetlights,” where they both share success stories over a drumless synth line and a wailing vocal sample. Worthy delivers a ruff-and-tumble recounting of beating federal cases and basking in musical heroes like Oakland rap legend Spice 1. Kamaiyah acknowledges how she went from being a neglected child to major-label hopeful to staunch indie artist who still snagged big-time co-signs. Each verse is inspiring on its own, but the interplay between Worthy’s stoicism and Kamaiyah’s melodies brings both accounts into clearer resolution.Both Worthy and Kamaiyah are so charismatic and laidback, they seem to not care if you’re listening to them or not.

706,"The Opium affiliate’s new album is a creative breakthrough, flipping the script on Atlanta rap production and funneling his hedonistic tendencies into joyously unholy music. “Fuck,” Ken Carson mutters on “Jennifer’s Body,” as KP Beatz and Lucian’s cybernetic beat starts, stops, starts, stops, like a heaving spacecraft that just needs a good kick. (He said it’s a Green Day reference.) Strange, gleeful moments like this signal his considered approach to curating his new album, A Great Chaos, designed with restless attention to damage—on loop, it could soundtrack a never-ending moshpit. The beats are some of the hardest Ken’s ever rapped on, but A Great Chaos transcends via its details—in the folds of its rich, Atlantan production, in Ken’s vastly expanded arsenal of vocal stunts and inflections—fleshing out the world of an artist who previously hinted at this promise in fits and starts.Ken Carson is a lot of things: Playboi Carti protégé turned star in his own right, excellent beat selector, style and swag influence to lots of young people. Somehow, still, the last thing I’d call him is “a good rapper.” Infusing Future and Thug’s straight-line flows and restless chants—and almost none of their personality or writing—with the artificial cool of a Mentos, he tends to lapse into wallpaper rage rap, the kind his young fans will pay money to see live because Carti hasn’t dropped in almost three years. They can barely explain what they like about his music.Well, something shifted on A Great Chaos. Within the churn of these outrageous beats, Ken sounds alive, funneling his hedonistic tendencies into joyously unholy music. Just a couple minutes shorter than his last album, the limp X (which sounds even more lifeless now), Chaos feels brisker due to its more calculated sequencing. As in the past, production is handled collaboratively by a familiar cadre of artists: Dutch producers Starboy and Outtatown, Working on Dying’s F1LTHY, Lucian, Ssor.t, Lukrative of the collective Neilaworld, to name a few. Refreshingly, instead of copy-pasting rage beats or trying to chase after an abstract notion of punk, this album achieves some of its most monstrous moments by flipping the script on Atlanta rap for a new generation. Check the tumbling keys and organ glissando on the epic “Me N My Kup,” or how the descending, Lex Luger-esque snare roll on “Singapore” introduces an icy duet with Opium labelmate Destroy Lonely. That transitions into the thrillingly blown-out “Lose It” (which asks, What if Ken Carson dropped a late-2000s Gucci Mane tape?) and then into the bludgeoning “Hardcore,” where Ken pulls a WIZRD-era Future, repeating the same four words so that their shape and texture is pulled apart and reconfigured like clay.",Rap,7.8
707,"On his second record for Mac DeMarco’s label, the Australian singer-songwriter settles into an effortlessly smooth sound perfectly suited for date-night soundtracks. Tex Crick has a rare ability to sound wistful without any sense of pain or longing. On Sweet Dreamin’, the Australian songwriter’s second LP for Mac DeMarco’s record label, his languid vocals take on a more prominent role as he croons over pop-piano melodies and humming analog synths lines that meet him like a warm embrace. Even with his newfound bravado, he is never looking to steal the spotlight with his voice or his perspective. This is peak park-hang music, genial and accomplished without trying to get complicated.Having played with Kirin J Callinan, Connan Mockasin, Weyes Blood, and Iggy Pop, Crick is no stranger to the ensemble approach. On Sweet Dreamin’, however, he recorded nearly every instrument by himself at his home base in Tokyo. (His sole collaborator is Miles Myjavec, who recorded the drum parts remotely from Australia.) Even as his own backing band, Crick conjures up a loose, lingering jam-session sound that doesn’t overstay its welcome. Songs are mostly under four minutes, and the fleeting moments of indulgence, like the ragtime interlude “Alley Cat” and contemplative “Drifting Off Again,” only add to the album’s casual atmosphere.Crick’s vocal delivery, hushed yet emotive, resembles the showmanship of Boz Scaggs at a more intimate scale. He’ll have fun within the mumbled scats on “Mulberry Wine,” rhyming “take it to go” with “Picasso,” but every declaration of love sounds effortless, with nary a vocal strain. “I’ll be waiting for ya/You bring my dreams to life,” he sings to a faraway sweetheart on “All I’m Dreaming Of.” Even when his narratives imply star-crossed romance, Crick sounds more like he’s looking forward to a nice vacation. His sentiments aren’t especially original, but he imbues them with enough charm to make the optimism believable.Though Crick’s piano is at the center of most of the album’s arrangements, the most interesting flourishes come from other instruments. It’s a small joy to hear the spurts of cowbell mixed into opener “Easy Keepers,” followed by the slinky bassline and rollicking synths of “Silly Little Things.” The richest tapestry materializes on “Barefoot Blues,” the closest Sweet Dreamin’ gets to a climax. Over a guitar lick inspired by Hawaiian lap steel music, Crick recalls a vivid affair that culminated in a serenade at a tiki bar. Appropriately, the most realized, romantic scene on the album is a memory of a live performance: “Oh, what a beautiful sound/It was heaven with two feet.”“Barefoot Blues” also stands out for its sense of place. Absent from Sweet Dreamin’ are the ambient urban sounds that added a touch of realism to Crick’s previous album, 2021’s Live in…New York City. While the music does evoke a cozy home studio—you can practically feel the carpet under your feet—the more anonymous setting can make the album feel a little shapeless. This won’t necessarily be a detriment: No matter where you are in the world, Sweet Dreamin’ sounds perfectly content to be a tasteful, unassuming date-night backdrop.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

708,"On her subdued debut album, the Tallahassee singer-songwriter constructs an eerie, beguiling world imbued with a supernatural charge. When the physical world is stifling, the internet beckons. It’s a sinister trap, one Sarah Morrison knows all too well. On “This Sorry Day,” the second track off the Tallahassee singer-songwriter’s subdued debut album, Attachment Figure, she soundtracks a draining day online with—what else?—smooth jazz. “While you were out I caved to my kitty instinct/Turned my computer on,” she sings with tired resignation over a dampened piano. Soon, her boredom shifts to the kinds of manic thoughts that follow spending hours viewing people through a screen: “Makes me want to laugh at me/Makes me want to look at me/Makes me want to touch me,” she chants, her whispered soprano turned dark and dissonant. But then, without warning, a velvet cyclone of a sax solo lifts the song aloft and carries it through its raging climax.Morrison has built an eerie, beguiling world in Attachment Figure, one where Southern fields, soft embraces, and bridal statues carry an air of unease, earthly treasures partly situated in an otherworldly plane. Album opener “Via Negativa” hints at this over sparse, dissonant chords, instructing us to recognize the divine through negation. “Could I get closer by knowing what love is not?” Morrison wonders quietly, before the track resolves its choral dissonance into major chords of religious bliss. On the indie-pop graveyard romp “Gray Apples,” the blurring divide between life and death becomes clearer as she walks with a light step among the graves of strangers, bounding synths tagging her spiritual questions: “What’s there to learn from those who’ve known the end?”Whether singing a tricky lyric in patient time or turning out fluttering melismatic phrases, Morrison’s wispy, warbling voice remains soft and bare, even in the album’s heated moments, of which there are a welcome few. Through the repetitive pounding keys on album highlight “To Kill a Buzzard,” she shudders in anger at the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, killed in 2020 in South Georgia, a few hundred miles away from her home. The song’s frenetic pace slows into a taunting country bridge: “Do you sleep better little gunner/Like with a fake dreamcatcher above your headboard?” she sneers, the ironic twang of a pedal steel echoing her disgust. On “Mango,” Morrison similarly dips into disturbed affect after receiving a hateful message wishing her childless for one thousand years. “Thanks for looking out for me,” she chirps, adding that the letter has only emboldened an act of imagined revenge, “conceiving made-up children to replace and defeat you with such sweet revelating gladness,” her quivering hush giving way to cathartic shouts and clattering, disturbed guitar licks.",Pop,7.3
709,"The London group dials up the psychedelia on its fourth album, swapping out retro-futurist tropes and avant-pop touchstones for uneasy atmospheres and narcotic languor. In the Odyssey, the lotus eaters existed on a small island, stuck in a dreamy stupor. They subsisted off the daze-inducing lotus fruit and spent their days consumed with narcotic pleasure. Vanishing Twin embrace a similar sense of hypnotic fantasy on their fourth album, Afternoon X. Their enveloping soundscapes sprawl out like a labyrinth; singer Cathy Lucas’ voice floats like a petal on a tranquil pond. Vanishing Twin’s previous albums, The Age of Immunology and Ookii Gekkou, drew easy comparisons to Stereolab’s surreal avant-pop and Sun Ra’s jazz futurism. But on Afternoon X, the group—formerly a quintet, now a trio—takes its psychedelic prog pop in an ethereal new direction, pursuing a meandering path between leisurely acoustic dream worlds and denser electronic composites, searching for a quiet moment before the next storm hits.In line with Stereolab’s referential tendencies, Vanishing Twin blend diverse influences, from French yé-yé pop to kosmische rock, into playful, shape-shifting jams, and Lucas’ nonchalant voice channels an air of art-house nostalgia. But their music doesn’t completely live in the past, pairing lyrics about looming ecological disasters with light-hearted guitar riffs. On previous records, atmospheric analog synths imbued their work with bright, splotchy colors, while Valentina Magaletti’s precise, metronomic drumming provided the music’s sleek pulse. With cryptic, imagistic lyrics, they framed existential questions with breezy charm. Many of those elements remain on Afternoon X, but in service of less accessible music, leaving the hooks of their previous work behind.Vanishing Twin slow down on Afternoon X, swapping out Magaletti’s snappy drumming for rumbles bubbling to the surface. The otherworldly samples scattered across past records play a more prominent role; field recordings of quotidian sounds—boat motors, bicycle wheels, radio static—flesh out the songs’ textures and rhythms. “You know, there’s all sorts of stuff out there in reality,” Magaletti said in a 2022 Quietus interview. The irregularity of these sounds—a sweet vocal refrain cut off by metallic beeps, or eerie, looping electronics punctuating chilled-out harmonies—reinforces the music’s unsettling qualities. Vanishing Twin make the most of that sense of disorientation; they build up a frame just to tear it down a second later. But there’s great excitement in that instability, as though you were wandering through the noise to find the answers with them. These structural shifts are particularly apparent on “The Down Below,” which unravels in multiple acts. It darts from droning sitars to stinging organs, peppered with jolting beats. The sonic jumble lends a haunting quality to Afternoon X, but its strange disjointness is more thrilling than offputting.",Rock,7.2
710,"The prolific New York rapper-producer’s latest album is self-assured and clear-eyed, ushering in an ambitious new era for the hometown hero. A little over halfway through MIKE’s new album, Burning Desire, a recent moment of joy in the New York rapper’s life takes center stage. During an interlude that begins on the title track, TAKA, MIKE’s friend and IFE Radio partner, recalls a fond memory from this summer’s Young World festival. The event, curated by MIKE, strived to connect disparate parts of rap’s underground. That day in July, a storm threatened to cut the show short, forcing organizers to pause the celebration as they waited out gray clouds. Eventually, the music resumed, and the first song played was the title track of the then-unannounced album. The moment, small and inconsequential, could’ve passed without second thought. But as TAKA’s words bleed into “They Don’t Stop in the Rain,” it instead feels like a testament to the serendipitous connections MIKE has forged. The New York rapper’s music can make small blessings feel transformative and cathartic—incidental details turned into canon events.MIKE’s Young World Rap Festival Puts Fans FirstThree months later, Burning Desire arrives, a clear-eyed record that builds on those musings about fate and happenstance. MIKE isn’t a volume shooter, but with his Wiki and the Alchemist collab Faith Is a Rock released just three weeks ago, Burning Desire makes the case that he could be. For most of the album, MIKE raps with the same hot-blooded urgency of December’s Beware of the Monkey. This time, however, he gives himself room to just bar out. When 10k labelmate Niontay and D.C. rapper El Cousteau join him on “Mussel Beach,” MIKE eases into a slippery flow to match their energy. Outside of rare side quests like Popstar Benny’s delirious “ATL Freestyle,” MIKE has seldom sounded this loose.Burning Desire moves between chest-puffing bombast and MIKE’s characteristic rumination, sometimes within the same breath. While angst and grief remain recurring subjects, here he chooses to honor loved ones instead of framing past hardships as insurmountable. MIKE’s tone has moved in this dynamic and self-assured direction since 2021’s Disco!. The confidence in his voice is palpable across Burning Desire, especially on “Sixteens,” where he sounds like he climbed to the top of the Rocky steps moments before hitting record.Under his producer alias dj blackpower, MIKE handles all but two of the album’s 24 tracks. (GAWD produced “African Sex Freak Fantasy,” while Laron is behind “Snake Charm.”) The beats range from misty loops that evoke the sentimentality of Count Bass D’s Dwight Spitz (“What U Say U Are,” “Let’s Have a Ball”) to cataclysmic landscapes (“plz don’t cut my wings,” “should be!”). Burning Desire illustrates MIKE’s evolution as a beatmaker, each song a tweezer-perfected terrarium of manipulated vocal samples, chunky loops, and rattling drums; the pockets of air MIKE finds within them make room for some of his most dexterous rapping yet. Take “Zap!”, where he bobs and weaves between brass stabs, or “African Sex Freak Fantasy,” where his words ricochet off walls of distorted bass like a rubber handball. The Liv.e and Venna-assisted “U think Maybe?” marks the first time that MIKE has incorporated live instrumentation in his production discography. After two minutes of wistful call-and-response, the London saxophonist’s somber performance and Liv.e’s aching voice melt into tranquil harmony.",Rap,8.1
711,"A sprawling new album from the Buffalo rapper subtly expands his raw and luxurious sound. Westside Gunn has spent his career treating rap music like a high-end commodity through keen juxtaposition: Vivid bars about cooking and selling drugs live side by side with scenic tours of his closet and passport, his sharp voice piercing through mesmerizing beats. If he thinks something is fly, then that’s as powerful as anything the greatest fashion houses could produce, a testament to determination, consistency, and will. On his new and purportedly final album, And Then You Pray for Me, Gunn sticks to his ethos but widens his palette, turning to classic trap music for inspiration.Westside Gunn and his Griselda Records have staked their claim through boom-bap-style production that echoes the ’90s New York sound of RZA and DJ Premier. Through go-to producers Daringer and Conductor Williams, the Buffalo crew landed on a sound that’s murkier, more desolate, and more melodic than typical golden age fare. Some of the best songs on And Then You Pray for Me stick to the formula and showcase Gunn’s captivating vocals and talent for beat selection and guest recruitment. On the smooth “Mamas PrimeTime,” Atlanta’s JID delivers a show-stealing verse with a slick verbosity that’s not often heard on Griselda tracks. The song represents what Gunn does best, concocting a grimy flyness and sounding raw and luxurious all at once.When Gunn switches to trap production, it’s like a dominant fastball pitcher turning to his off-speed stuff; it might still get the job done, but the intent is perplexing. Two of the trap beats on And Then You Pray for Me are produced by Memphis mainstay Tay Keith, but the majority are produced by the otherwise unknown Miguel the Plug. The Tay Keith songs—“Kostas” and “Steve and Jony”—are invigorating, enveloping, and somewhat alien, all hallmarks of a genre known for world-beating bombast. Miguel the Plug’s beats, on the other hand, have a lot and very little going on simultaneously. The skittering hi-hats, staid bassline, and rudimentary piano melody of “DunnHill,” for example, don’t do much to elevate the instrumental beyond something you might find on YouTube for free. Gunn has a proclivity for muted production, and it sounds as if he is trying to strip the aesthetic to its core, but the results are not as gritty or compelling as usual.While not as natural a setting, the trap turn allows Gunn to showcase mixtape legends like Jeezy, Rick Ross, DJ Drama, DJ Trap-A-Holics, and DJ Swamp Izzo, all of whom feature on the album and bring their own strains of rap history. Past projects featured Slick Rick, Jadakiss, Fat Joe, Raekwon, and Busta Rhymes, presenting an important but limited view of hip-hop’s heroes. By featuring musicians outside of New York and its traditions, Gunn expands his views of what and who constitute the regal end of rap.Westside Gunn balances his trap ambitions with the straightforward Griselda cuts, dotting the album with more raucous songs to suggest a symbiosis between the trap and boom-bap genres. The album has a careening momentum, with more familiar tracks like “Jalen Rose,” “The Revenge of Flips Legs,” and “Suicide in Selfridges” scattered to remind us of his strengths. Westside Gunn has said that And Then You Pray for Me is a sequel to Pray for Paris, his pivotal 2020 album that stood apart with a finely concentrated smoothness and confidence. For a rapper who has always followed his own logic, this exploratory collection makes sense as the de facto follow-up. And Then You Pray for Me is not an extension of its predecessor but an explosion: a broad, loud, and messy exploration of Gunn’s vision for rap and art.",Rap,6.9
712,"The Massachusetts producer’s new Christianity-themed album infuses Chicago drill and Atlanta trap with an air of holiness. Devstacks might as well have a Ph.D. in Chief Keef studies. The Springfield, Massachusetts, producer is part of a SoundCloud-based community that builds on moments of instrumental grandeur scattered across Keef’s discography (see loosies like “Fool Ya” or tapes like GloToven), imagining what would happen if that small slab of his style was its own thing. What materialized is a microgenre dubbed “regalia,” which basically infuses Chicago drill and Atlanta trap with the orchestral extravagance of old Hollywood epics and royal animes. Scriptures, the seven track mixtape entirely rapped and produced by Devstacks, is an all-out showcase for the style and a mesmerizing journey in its own right.If the title isn’t a dead giveaway, or the massive cross on the album cover, let me tell you that Christianity is the mixtape’s overarching theme. But it’s channeled into the hallowed production more than the messaging (although he does rap at one point, “She say she a Christian/I think she a liar/She was in them streets/But she said she retired,” so maybe that’s something.) The intro “Praise God” is true to its title, sounding like it should be playing over an impassioned speech from The Ten Commandments; by the time Devstacks starts lightly murmuring, you hardly register his brags about Prada and how he could “bag yo’ mama’.” Instead, his voice feels like another instrument added to the layers. The following track, “Nun Like the Rest,” is similarly over-the-top, making you feel like you’re staring upward in a cathedral, thanks to digital whispers that don’t sound far off from sped-up Grimes.The fluttering, melodramatic beats are the main draw; the plain lyrics and melodies are secondary. I listen to Scriptures much like I do a Pi’erre Bourne album. You could point out the unimaginative simplicity of say, “Cookin’ all these beats like I’m bakin’,” on “U Didn’t,” but really the song is about how his voice inhabits the guitar-driven spectacle. Or you could note how his vocals are flat and boring on “Can’t Help It,” but the celestial bent he puts on mid-2010s Metro Boomin and Sonny Digital makes you want to let it slide. It’s hard to forgive “Facetime,” though, because the beat just sounds like an Opium reject.The brevity of Scriptures is a blessing, because its sound is so potent that hearing too much would be like biting into a head of garlic. Structural shakeups could give the sound more legs: A bright spot in that respect is “Glo Up,” which starts off with Devstacks repeating “Had to glo up, had to show them” while synths that sound like choral chants keep the Biblical mood intact. Then in the back half, the beat fades out and turns to quiet yet heavenly pianos and choir croons. Devstacks catches you off guard for a moment, which goes a long way. As any Keef head knows, sometimes those few unpredictable seconds blow your mind the most.",Rap,7.0
713,"The Chicago-based indie rocker beefs up her sound on her third LP. Foregrounding her confident voice and formidable guitar skills, it’s a compact, muscular record guided by a single-minded intensity. For the past few years, Ella Williams has been relentless. The Massachusetts-born, Chicago-based songwriter released her debut album as Squirrel Flower in 2020 and then, after contracting COVID and recovering, recorded and released a follow-up in 2021. Last year, she gathered enough material for a self-produced EP. For a young musician—Williams is 27, and started recording music when she was 18—such a sustained level of output could be exhausting, in many senses of the word: It might lead to burnout, or empty the reserves of what she has to say. But on Williams’ new record, Tomorrow’s Fire, all that effort has only intensified her ambition. It’s a beautiful, searing record in which Williams channels listlessness and desperation into sweltering, explosive rock songs.When she first began releasing music on Bandcamp, Williams winkingly tagged Squirrel Flower’s output, recorded when she was a student at Iowa’s Grinnell College, as “cornfield-folk,” “prairie-pop” and “post-Monsanto.” That early songwriting and her debut album, I Was Born Swimming, were promising if somewhat fragmentary folk-tinged indie-rock, and her music became bolder and more brooding on her sophomore record, Planet (i). But Williams’ true strengths have long been her fierce guitar skills and powerful, confident voice, and on Tomorrow’s Fire, she and producer Alex Farrar (known for his work with artists like Wednesday, Indigo De Souza, and Snail Mail) push both to the fore. The resulting album—made with a sharp studio band, including MJ Lenderman, storied Asheville collaborator Seth Kauffman, and members of Bon Iver and the War On Drugs—is compact and muscular; Williams refines her singular voice as a songwriter, bringing a focused, single-minded intensity to her songs without giving the impression that she’s ever repeating herself.Throughout Tomorrow’s Fire, Williams combines graceful vocal harmonies and big, reverb-laden guitars in a way that makes her songs feel cavernous, as at the cathartic end of “Almost Pulled Away,” or on the fuzzy, blistering “Canyon.” “When a Plant Is Dying,” a slow-burning ode to perseverance under grueling conditions, features a full minute of guitar solos that burn bright with indignation and pent-up frustration. But Williams knows her way around a hook, too: “Intheskatepark” is buoyant and sunny, verging on indie pop, and “Alley Light” has a catchy heartland-rock sensibility. Tomorrow’s Fire’s opener is actually a reworking of one of Williams’ earliest songs. Here, what was originally spare and lonely becomes hypnotic and lush, washing Williams’ voice in a cascade of harmonies—a testament to her creativity in the studio and increasing command of her sound.",Rock,7.4
714,"El Conejo Malo’s fifth solo LP is a rap homecoming. It doesn’t possess the magic or sophistication of his best work, but it’s just as horny and cavalier. Once upon a time, Bad Bunny was the king of a movement called Latin trap. Seven years ago, before the Rolling Stone covers and the Gucci ads with Kendall Jenner, Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio was an audacious newcomer with labyrinthine graphics on his scalp and a closet full of neon short-shorts. When his 2022 album Un Verano Sin Ti—a pop masterwork immersed in Caribbean humidity and dreamy glitz—arrived, it catapulted him into the public eye like never before. If you weren’t already following Benito’s journey, UVST’s gushing sentimentality and commercial polish made it seem like the Puerto Rican artist had always been the kind of pop star who sells out stadiums. But acolytes know that Benito has long been an elite rapper—even if he’s sometimes sidelined that skill on his jaunt to the top.Nadie sabe lo que va a pasar mañana, Bad Bunny’s fifth solo studio LP, functions like a rap homecoming. The album is bloated but thematically focused, centered on some of Benito’s favorite topics: fucking, counting racks, his love of Puerto Rico. As he embraces the insouciant recklessness and unabashed horniness that enamored the globe, some might rejoice that El Conejo Malo has returned to his roots. Though he’s preternaturally funny and frequently debonair, only a portion of these songs approach the vim and vigor of his generation-defining anthems.Nadie sabe comes to life when Benito is intentionally provocative or artfully humorous. His smutty wisecracks produce laugh-out-loud gems: On the salacious “Baticano,” he invokes Teletubby characters in a rhyme about putting his pinky in a woman’s ass and making love to her where she “pees” and “poops.” On “Fina,” he brags about his dick being bald and big-headed, like the four-year-old cartoon character Caillou. “Thunder y Lightning” is a gritty drill howl, with Benito and guest Eladio Carrión going bar for bar as they stunt through deep-cut Puerto Rican sports references. When the song ends, Benito takes a jab at former creative partner J Balvin for being too infatuated with success, noting that he’s “friends with everybody.”The antics are entertaining, and embody the cavalier goofiness that has set Bad Bunny apart in an industry full of high-gloss acts with little to say. But many songs lack the sophistication and structural complexity of his trap epics. Opener “Nadie Sabe” is a Drake-adjacent lament on celebrity insecurity, while “Hibiki,” “Gracias Por Nada,” and “Baby Nueva” are marred by unimaginative flexing and empty kiss-offs. Benito usually does everything with a peerless sense of panache and individuality—and a thoughtful eye for the issues affecting his homeland—so it feels uncharacteristic for him to be preoccupied with such prosaic concerns. Even Benito himself seems to recognize this: On the highlight “Los Pits,” which recalls Jay-Z’s realization in “Moment of Clarity,” he claims that he could be “rapping about more profound issues, but the checks arrive and confuse me.”",Rap,7.4
715,"The Chicago R&B poet and singer doesn’t just write about losing or finding love: Her tender and curious new album is all about the transformative potential of the journey. How much would you let love change you? That’s the dare that singer and songwriter Jamila Woods tosses inside the circle on her sprawling new album Water Made Us. Across 17 songs, she considers love as a cell that can mutate and multiply, and she asks us to celebrate as she revels in its changes. It’s been four years since LEGACY! LEGACY!, an impatient bullhorn lofted by an artist urgent to set right historical slights. Since then Woods has been preoccupied by an inward metamorphosis, telling Them that she sought “to represent different stages of my life or relationships as a cycle.” While her earlier work sought to be definitive, here she’s fluid, tethered only to a personal philosophy of contentment and surrender. The musical inclinations and existential inquiries are curious and voracious, yet Woods keeps them sprightly and agile.“Bugs,” the opener, is deceptively nonchalant in its pursuit of love. “Why not have pleasure on your way to the one/Or the second one?” Woods asks. Searching for “the one” can feel futile; she makes the task appear worthy, almost noble, less about finding and more about savoring. She also advises us to chill out: “Why so much pressure?” Jasminfire’s soaring violin gives the song a nursery rhyme quality that quickly turns hymnal, while drummer Homer Steinweiss turns the latter part of the song into a jazz session, trading fours to wind down the night. “Send a Dove” is smooth and melodic, in the vein of R&B heavyweights Mtume, and samples Nikki Giovanni’s far-reaching SOUL! with James Baldwin. Giovanni talked to Baldwin about love, relationships, and the responsibility to show up for each other with gentleness, even when it’s difficult or untrue in the moment. “Fake it with me,” she implored. Woods continues that potent plea, singing, “Don’t save your worst for me/I’m not your leather Everlast… Lie to me still.” In conversation with her inspirations and contemporaries, particularly Kelela on Raven, Woods asks if her paramours are strong enough to do what love requires.Songs like “Wreckage Room,” “Thermostat,” and “I Miss All My Exes” are candid with a hint of play. Woods speaks from her soul and makes life’s virtues—trust, faith, hope, memory—seem not just aspirational but necessary. Julian Reed’s piano lends an ominous air to the naked grief of the former two songs, while siblings Ayanna and Kamaria Woods’ choral harmonies on “Wreckage Room” evoke the familiarity and comfort of those we trust to carry us at our lowest: our family. The humor emerges as Woods revisits the quirks that made every past relationship similar yet different, remembering how it felt to be cared for by exes who “cook veggie burgers with Lawry’s, lemon pepper everything,” or those “who talk to God in a different language.”",Pop,8.0
716,"The English singer-songwriter makes her full-length debut with a charmingly melodramatic set full of earnest writing and kinetic, multi-dimensional production. Holly Humberstone had a whirlwind 2021. Around the release of her debut EP, The Walls Are Way Too Thin, she earned touring spots with Olivia Rodrigo and Girl in Red, collaborated with fellow British success story Sam Fender, and won the Rising Star award at the BRITs. Her success was unsurprising, considering how squarely her work fit in the zeitgeist, indebted to Taylor Swift’s confessional pop writing and Phoebe Bridgers’ snarky folk music, married to vocoders and intricate synth programming straight out of a 1975 song (Matt Healy even co-wrote a track). Accordingly, her debut full-length Paint My Bedroom Black has all the angst of a young-star-dealing-with-fame record. Humberstone took the time to define herself as an artist outside the hype cycle: an endearingly wordy songwriting voice elevated by expansive, kinetic production.Like her contemporaries, Humberstone excels at melodrama, but hers is more deliberate in its execution. It’s one thing to feel remorse for being a bad partner; it’s another to call yourself the Antichrist while the backing track plays homage to Kanye’s “Runaway.” You can want someone you shouldn’t, or you can declare, “You’re the center of the universe, my sorry ass revolves around you.” Humberstone lands a careful balance of pop theatrics and earnest emotion that might be overbearing if she wasn’t equally adept at more intimate expressions. She’s a strong enough writer that it’s disappointing when songs like “Kissing in Swimming Pools” end with stark lyrics like, “I just want to be alone with you.”Humberstone’s music works just fine in stripped-down acoustic settings, but her producers—primarily Phoebe Bridgers’ collaborator Ethan Gruska and former Dog Is Dead frontman Rob Milton—turn every song into a holographic, immersive environment. Even the relatively conventional R&B ballad “Girl” is full of piano stabs, distorted synths, and Gruska’s murky rubber bridge guitars. “Flatlining,” one of several songs produced with Jonah Summerfield and Noah Conrad, is the most surprising experiment, with a manic backing track that nods to Jersey Club as much as it does Lorde.The only outright misstep is “Cocoon,” where a generic 2010s-indie rock arrangement flattens some of the record’s most intense lines (“I’ve become a taxidermied version of myself”). Throughout the rest of the album, the production only elevates her writing. Even on minor tracks like the vocoder interlude “Baby Blues” or the stiff duet with TikTok star D4VD, “Superbloodmoon,” there’s a lovely narrative or an unexpected vocal effect that saves things from becoming too mundane. At the end of electro-country ballad “Ghost Me,” the drums fall away, and Humberstone includes a goofy voice memo of a friend (the Lauren of “Lauren”) comparing herself to a SpongeBob. It’s undeniably silly but oddly relatable, getting by on sincerity once the novelty wears away.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

717,"The Australian singer is a hedonistic pop hero on an album that pulls together club nights, tender moments, last-call horniness, and eclectic samples with remarkable finesse. On his 2015 debut, Blue Neighbourhood, Troye Sivan pitched himself as a dreamy outsider torn from the pages of a YA novel, taking in the world with a wide-eyed gaze that saw far beyond small-town limits. But rather than settling for Lorde imitation or soundtracking John Green adaptations for the rest of his life, Sivan gradually shed his youthful preciousness and adopted a more adult perspective. 2018’s Bloom graduated out of the suburbs and into other peoples’ bedrooms, with anthemic pop songs about bottoming and hooking up with older men for the first time. The music was still booming and melodramatic, but its writing was distinctly more funny and lived-in, dispatches from an artist who’d matched observation to experience by actually fucking around and finding out.Enter “Rush,” the electrifying, sex-addled lead single to his third album Something to Give Each Other. The song hit like a jolt of poppers and cut through any prior notion of who the singer might be. It immediately reintroduced Sivan as a libertine pop hero, combining hazy, impressionistic lyrics with a breakneck house beat and roaring, homoerotic football chants. Encouraged by his best friend and collaborator, Leland, to “go make a fucking hot video… [and come] out with your dick swinging,” Sivan decamped to Berlin with the filmmaker Gordon von Steiner for a week’s worth of shooting and partying. The final music video is a tableau of lockstep choreography, polymorphous perversity, and nightlife mischief in all of its dank glory. The placid, angel-faced expression that fronted the cover of his debut record had been wiped off and replaced with a lusty pout, with any trace of preciousness long since sweated off on the dancefloor.Something to Give Each Other was conceived after a break-up during a period of extended singleness. Bloom’s starry-eyed expressions of love are replaced with a much more open conception of romance and sexuality, where intimate connection forms spontaneously. Long-distance yearning bleeds into last-call horniness on “What’s the Time Where You Are?” when Sivan rounds out the chorus by crooning “I’m right on top of this groove/but God, I wish it was you.” On “One of Your Girls” he serenades a straight guy into hooking up, riding a boy-band hook straight out of *NSYNC with a lascivious hot girl wink. And no amount of repeat listens will ever diminish the off-the-charts boldness of the heartfelt plea in “How to Stay with You” to: “Turn my bussy out.”Something to Give Each Other is a showcase for some dazzling eclecticism. Ideas that couldn’t possibly work on paper are executed skillfully and to often gorgeous effect. Want to hear Jessica Pratt’s heartbreaking warble over a dance beat? Behold the achingly downcast “Can’t Go Back, Baby.” ¿Quieres Troye en español? See the sultry “In My Room.” “Got Me Started” bookends its propulsive two-step beat with a sample snatched from Bag Raiders’ “Shooting Stars,” aka that years-old meme. Although initially grating, its wiggling synths build upon the song’s romantic pining in a way that feels funnily reminiscent of Overmono’s sample-heavy take on UK garage.",Pop,8.0
718,"The Montreal songwriter shifts toward a stripped-back, folksier sound, highlighting her gossamer voice as she reflects on the ache of grief and the passage of time. Helena Deland’s stirring new record Goodnight Summerland opens wordlessly, with a measured, melancholy piano sketch played by Lysandre Ménard. On the next song, Deland admits: “Saying something isn’t easy.” The introduction is a small moment of grace—a recognition that, sometimes, we need space to collect our thoughts before we can find the right words—and a fitting welcome to a stirring, reflective set of songs from the Montreal-based musician.Deland’s previous work has been similarly marked by contemplation, though she’s worked across a variety of sounds. Her debut album, Someone New, paired straightforward singer-songwriter inclinations with dense electronic textures. It followed a series of EPs that included swaggering indie rock, yearning folk, and bubbly synth-pop. Recently, she’s collaborated with the rapper JPEGMAFIA and the experimental musician Claire Rousay, and made a collaborative electronic record as Hildegard with producer and multi-instrumentalist Ouri. But Goodnight Summerland displays a fresh focus and intention. Here, Deland shifts toward a stripped-back, folksier sound, highlighting her gossamer voice and newfound observations about the ache of grief and the passage of time.Deland made Goodnight Summerland in the shadow of loss: Her mother, Maria, died in the summer of 2021. Deland wrote some of these songs before her mother’s death and recorded demos in her parents’ home in the weeks immediately following. Grief trails her across the album, starting from her first lines, which tell of “cream-colored ashes” and saying goodbye. Later, the stunning “Who I Sound Like” captures Deland in the shadowy space between desolation and acceptance, where she addresses her mother directly: “I just want to talk to you,” she repeats.Throughout the record, Deland is accompanied mainly by her own acoustic guitar and some gentle percussion, with the occasional touch of piano and woodwinds. She made the record with producer Sam Evian, who plays various instruments on the record, and a small band. The subtlety of the production serves to highlight the record’s lodestar: Deland’s high, sweet voice. It can shift effortlessly between modes: conversational, placid, aching, curious, joyful; it’s rarely ever forceful but carries the emotional weight of introspection. The clarity of Deland’s voice is striking, given how often her lyrics highlight the slipperiness of language itself. “Maria, I might never know what I’d tell you,” she sings on “Saying Something.” On “Drawbridge,” she asks: “When we said ‘later’/What did you mean?” On “Night Soft as Silk,” she urges, “Tell me everything you think,” before admitting, “words can be so mild.”",Experimental,7.4
719,"The UK producer’s new record pulls apart the seams of dance music, trading four-on-the-floor beats for meditative chaos and boundless expansion. Something secret is happening in JR Seaton’s work as Call Super. Over the last decade, they have developed a private language for their largely instrumental electronic music, which skirts the edges of the dancefloor like a small woodland creature slinking through the underbrush. Pay attention to the track titles, and weird patterns and semi-rhymes emerge—apparent series like “Okko Ink,” “Ekko Ink,” and “Ekkles,” or Arpo and “Arpo Sunk”; vowel-heavy names like Suzi Ecto, “Sulu Sekou,” “Fluenka Mitsu”; the aliases Elmo Crumb and Ondo Fudd. These mysterious, staccato words and phrases, occasionally nodding playfully to Harpo Marx or Elmer Fudd, suggest a code that might unlock the secrets of the UK musician’s invented universe, if only we could crack it.On Call Super’s fourth album, Eulo Cramps—there’s another one of those cryptic titles—this trail of breadcrumbs leads not out of the woods but deeper into it. Seaton started out in the early 2010s making stern, barnstorming club tracks, and they’ve never completely abandoned their dancefloor tendencies—just see the lush, quick-stepping “Swallow Me,” from last year, or the sparkling floor-fillers of 2021’s Cherry Drops I and II. But Call Super’s three previous albums have frequently strayed far from club convention, swapping four-on-the-floor beats and crowd-moving riffs for serpentine clarinet melodies and crinkly textures of tin foil and bubble wrap. Those motifs, indebted to both Jon Hassell’s ambient jazz and the electric-typewriter rhythms of early IDM, have become signature elements of Call Super’s music. On Eulo Cramps, they render their most holistic and beguiling vision yet.The new album is part of a broader multimedia project, Tell Me I Didn’t Choose This, that will combine text, painting, and music. But even experienced in isolation, Eulo Cramps feels like a culmination of ideas that have been bubbling in Call Super’s work for years. It’s shot through with acoustic or acoustic-sounding instruments: piano, congas, drums, bells, and harp strings. Melancholy clarinet melodies—played by Seaton’s father, then multi-tracked into eerie harmonic clouds, or twisted and pitch-shifted into surreal, synthetic ribbons—form the tonal center of many tracks. Sounds jostle together, collide, and sometimes fuse, endowed with an unusually tactile heft. In some moments, it feels as if Seaton has daubed on keys with a sponge or putty knife, yielding thick, gloopy streaks; the high end bristles with metallic shards and wooden splinters. It’s the most vivid sound design of the producer’s career.",Electronic,7.9
720,"The New York producer’s second album is a dense and dizzying suite of collages that invites close listening. Excelsior is Jasper Marsalis’ first album under the moniker Slauson Malone 1, but it’s his second solo album since leaving the Brooklyn-based collective Standing on the Corner. Where that group fashioned their tastes in jazz, lo-fi indie, and soul-sampling hip-hop into genre-spanning mixtapes and beats for Earl Sweatshirt and Solange, Marsalis is more interested in layering dissonant sounds on top of one another for dense collages. And so Excelsior is ambitious: Marsalis accompanies himself with nearly two dozen different instruments, from guitar to theremin, from Mellotron to Wurlitzer; the genre experiments combine grungy no-wave, free jazz, chamber music, and more. The results are always unpredictable and occasionally sublime.Album opener “The Weather” crackles to life like the opening synths of a film score, recorded straight to tape. Marsalis’ syrupy vocals rise and exit with the thump of a piano before the tape loops and the whole process begins again. Those fuzzy, moody compositions will sound familiar to anyone who listened to Marsalis’ previous album, 2019’s A Quiet Farwell, 2016–2018 (Crater Speak). But where that record was a quiet landscape with occasional cracks of thunder, Excelsior fills every corner with words and sound. Some of the strongest moments come when he shares the stage with collaborators who rein in the wilder tastes. On “Decades, Castle Romeo,” cellist Nicky Wetherell provides baroque accompaniment to Marsalis’ guitar work that flows between dreamy strumming and dissonant psych rock. Later, “Us (Tower of Love)” puts Wetherell front and center, creating an affecting piece of modern classical composition to support Marsalis’ modulated vocals.Marsalis plays with this type of tension throughout the album. “I Hear a New World” begins like a noise rock interpretation of police sirens before resolving into the lull of a harpsichord. “Half-Life” sounds as much like Sonic Youth as it does like a Jeff Parker guitar suite, while the sleepily intimate “Voyager” could as easily be a bedroom-pop B-side or the instrumental for an experimentally-inclined rapper like MIKE. Even “No! (Geiger Dub),” one of the most straightforward tracks, begins with a reggae bassline before Marsalis pairs it with an indie folk vocal that eventually resolves into a short psych-rock jam. While this shapeshifting might seem overwhelming, Marsalis provides some grounding wires: His work on guitar features heavily throughout, either looped (“Voyager,” “Divider”) or gently strummed (“Olde Joy,” “Decades, Castle Romeo”) to help bridge the tracks together.While Marsalis is swiftly evolving his own sound, his work continues to nod to experimental artists like serpentwithfeet, King Krule, billy woods, and he has expanded his cast of collaborators and references to match his expanding horizons. Excelsior includes production credits from Chocolate Genius and assists from BADBADNOTGOOD drummer Alexander Sowinski; the tracklist includes a cover of eccentric audio engineer Joe Meek and a track (“Undercommons”) named after a collection of essays from the Black cultural theorists Fred Moten and Stefano Harney. It’s a dense piece of work and a dizzying journey, but at its best, you get the sense Marsalis knows exactly where his spaceship is going.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

721,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit the Ohio new wave band’s 1982 debut, an arch yet sincere sendup of humdrum modern life. Chris Butler hadn’t actually formed the Waitresses when Village Voice columnist Robert Christgau came to watch them play a showcase of local bands in Akron, Ohio. It was 1978, and Butler had been mailing Christgau every issue of his self-published art zine Blank purely out of admiration. Within a month, he got a call from the New York rock critic, who was eager to report on the Akron scene chronicled in its pages. Butler scampered around, secured dingy dive bar JB’s as a venue, enlisted the Bizarros, Chi Pig, and Tin Huey to pad out the lineup, and “spent a feverish two weeks trying to locate every piece of PA in the area,” as he recalled in Sounds magazine a few years later.The Waitresses were also on the bill at JB’s, even though they weren’t much more than an elaborate practical joke. The bit dated back to 1977, when one night Butler and his friend Liam Sternberg, a songwriter and producer, were kvetching about commercial pop over diner coffee and pineapple upside-down cake. At the time, Devo were the reigning artistic force in Akron, attracting curious, twitching eyes to a city best known for rubber and tire production. Butler, who was playing in experimental blues outfit the Numbers Band and had attended Kent State University around the same time as Mark Mothersbaugh and Gerald Casale, was feeling the pangs of DIY ambition. As the cartoonish local legend goes, he looked around the restaurant and declared that he should just start a band called… the Waitresses.Butler put the Waitresses’ name to wax for the first time some point between ’77 and ’78, when he cut the In “Short Stack” 7"" for Akron indie label Clone. Side A was “Slide,” a jangly bit of blues rock reminiscent of Lou Reed and T. Rex. Side B was stamped with a Devo knockoff called “Clones,” complete with warbling robot vocals and lyrics like, “We are not men/We’re just clones.” On the record’s back sleeve, an androgynous figure sports a T-shirt emblazoned with Butler’s prank promotional slogan: “Waitresses Unite.” The schtick was slowly becoming a reality.In the summer of ’78, the UK pub-rock imprint Stiff released a sampler called The Akron Compilation, which originated when Mothersbaugh dragged label co-founder Dave Robinson into a basement to pitch him on some homegrown bands. The 14-track LP included cuts by bands like Tin Huey, the Bizarros, Rubber City Rebels, Sniper, Idiots Convention, and Chi Pig; the insert was printed with images of local factories, and topped with a scratch-and-sniff sticker that smelled like a tire. Robinson thought he’d discovered the Liverpool of the late ’70s.",Electronic,8.2
722,"Commissioned as the soundtrack to a line of prefab homes, this 1986 ambient masterpiece doubles as a frame for the smallest, most quotidian sounds. It’s a testament to the act of listening itself. Hiroshi Yoshimura was sitting with his eyes closed. Beneath him, a mat. Beside him, several stones. In his hands he held a soprano saxophone. It was September 1977, and he and the musician Akio Suzuki were staging a performance titled HOT BREATH. For the next 12 hours, their time would belong to the act of listening. The 36-year-old composer wanted his music to be “as close to air itself” as possible, and it’s easy to imagine that on that Saturday, he captured something at the level of particles. Above his head hung a paper structure dubbed the “cloud mobile.” It twirled as a result of his movements and his playing, and maybe the opening of a nearby door. If he longed to be part of something grander, something interconnected, Yoshimura got there one modest gesture at a time.Yoshimura, who died in 2003, believed that any given artwork—like individual human existence itself—represented a single thread of a much larger tapestry. He joined the Taj Mahal Travellers in 1974, and under the leadership of Fluxus artist Takehisa Kosugi, the free-improvisation group held concerts in the city and in nature, often accompanied by footage of the ocean. Brian Eno’s Ambient 1: Music for Airports would arrive at the tail end of the decade, bringing with it something new: kankyō ongaku, or “environmental music,” a style of site-specific sound art. Yoshimura’s first foray into the genre came with 1982’s Music for Nine Post Cards, created to be played back at the Hara Museum of Contemporary Art. The spirit of the piece recalls something he once said of a Harold Budd performance: “full of kindness and refinement, allowing us to open up our hearts without limits.” Yoshimura’s compositions were similarly self-effacing and similarly transformative, meant to affect the way we interact with the world.Yoshimura would spend his career writing songs for public spaces, and the fullest realization of that was his 1986 LP Surround, commissioned by Misawa Homes Institute of Research and Development as a set of soundscapes for the company’s prefabricated houses. The task was daunting: He had to make people’s homes—the most intimate, comfortable place in anyone’s life—even more hospitable. The album’s most arresting quality points to his solution: It encourages an appreciation for everyday beauty. Yoshimura was keenly receptive to the sublimity of the world around him; he’d once spent an entire day looking heavenward, playing his piano to the steady drifting of clouds. Such dedicated practices may have informed the natural rhythms at the heart of Surround, where patient metallophone and guitar-like melodies swim in reflecting pools of limpid electronic tone. The synths on “Something blue” are as charming as they are inviting, every phrase like a cresting wave to float upon. It sounds like Eno’s “1/1” if the latter were twice as fast and suffused with childlike whimsy. It’s this playfulness that sets Yoshimura’s music apart. The music of forebears like Erik Satie, who he loved since high school, could often be construed as forlorn; Surround’s brand of introspection is eminently hopeful.",Electronic,9.0
723,"Six months after their debut album, Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers, and Lucy Dacus return with a self-mythological companion EP aglow with the sense of triumph from their imperial year. For years, Phoebe Bridgers has been on an odyssey to the moon. She yearned for a spaceship to carry her away from a strained relationship on Boygenius’ 2018 self-titled EP; the trio’s full-length debut ends with Bridgers gazing at the full moon as she pulls away from her tormentor. On “Voyager,” the third song on Boygenius’ new EP, The Rest, Bridgers has finally landed. “Walking alone in the city/Makes me feel like a man on the moon,” she sings, taking stock of the journey. Her bandmates Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus are there with her, swaddling each lyric, cushioning each step, with hummed harmony. These are friends—the ones you tell your stories to, again and again, who stick around for every revision and new installment.Friendship, famously, is Boygenius’ raison d’être and a key part of its value proposition. Kindred spirits who first met while making the rounds with their respective solo projects, Baker, Bridgers, and Dacus were eventually booked on a joint tour, precipitating their first EP together. Almost immediately, their union accumulated extramusical significance. Initially, it felt like wish fulfillment for those eager to pass off women playing rock as a newsworthy event; ultimately, it settled into an extended counterpoint to heteropatriarchal ideas about feminine friendship and cooperation, and to the notion of genius as an attribute of erratic (male) individualists. (When a prominent contemporary embodiment of that idea recently used Boygenius as the setup for a cheap joke, Dacus minced no words.)Over the pandemic, seeking companionship and a creative outlet, the band got back together to write and record a proper debut—The Record, released this March. Six months later, they’re following it with The Rest, a four-song companion EP aglow with the sense of triumph that has haloed the group’s recent history. Boygenius are about as big as a rock band can be in 2023: They’ve landed an album in Billboard’s Top 10, received second-line billing at Coachella (“I’ve never played a festival when the sun was down,” Baker quipped), and, earlier this month, sold out Madison Square Garden. Their shows incite rapture; all three women are queer, a clear subtext and surtext of their performances, which has solidified their tour’s reputation as a welcoming space for sapphic expression.With Boygenius’ tour wrapping at the end of the month, The Rest bookends this period of transcendence, its title containing a note of finality as well as of respite. The songs feel unwound; on the cover, the boys are faceless figures before a misty sea, soaking in the sublime, like in a Caspar David Friedrich painting. Unlike many post-album clearing-house EPs, this material is brand new, produced in May with returning collaborators (Tony Berg, Ethan Gruska, Collin Pastore) along with affiliates of the members’ solo projects. The songs revisit old themes, like Bridgers’ lunar voyage, with clear eyes and renewed spirits. Baker reconsiders the black hole that appeared on The Record’s “Not Strong Enough”—there, a symbol of domestic unrest; here, one of unexpected potential. “You can see the stars/The ones the headlines said this morning/Were being spat out /By what we thought was just/Destroying everything for good,” she sings over a steady pedal point, referencing a recently discovered supermassive black hole that mysteriously produces new stars instead of obliterating old ones. This cosmic twist on the notion that destructive forces can be generative calls to mind another lyric from The Record. To quote Dacus quoting Leonard Cohen: “There’s a crack in everything, that’s how the light gets in.”",Rock,7.5
724,"The latest archival set collects demos and live recordings from the pivotal years between the stark solo songs of For the Roses, her full-band masterpiece Court and Spark, and the impressionistic jazz-pop of The Hissing of Summer Lawns. We hear a drummer counting off and then a half-sentence from his bandleader, Joni Mitchell, who in April 1972, was embarking on the first official recording sessions for For the Roses. One year earlier, she’d released Blue, the album that solidified her place, at the age of 27, as one of the greatest songwriters who ever lived. After that came a period of reflection and retreat from the music industry and its hometown of Los Angeles, both of which she’d begun to view with suspicion. She moved to a stone cabin in rural British Columbia, listened to the arbutus trees rustling at her window, entertained the occasional deranged fan who managed to find her there, and wrote songs about whatever came to her.Many of these new songs were about an artist’s relationship to her own work; to the audiences who receive and justify it; and to the middlemen who both facilitate and corrupt this exchange. The sojourn to the country had been artistically fruitful, but Mitchell, whose questioning mind was at its sharpest when it took its own motives up for examination, eventually started to wonder why she was there. The house had been “conceived out of paranoia,” she told an audience later. She’d hoped to escape the corruption of the city: “Suddenly everything that was good and virtuous seemed very important to me. Well, that’s alright, but it leaves very little room for humanness, you know?” In late 1971, she returned to L.A. and started recording.“Give me that again,” it sounds like she’s saying on the tape as the drummer counts off a full-band rehearsal of “See You Sometime” on a new box set, Joni Mitchell: Archives, Vol. 3: The Asylum Years (1972-1975). One benefit of life among the humans: other musicians to play with. Mitchell had never been a foursquare folk songwriter, but the songs she’d written since Blue were more complexly rhythmic than anything that had come before. Evidently, their contours suggested to her the sound of an ensemble, in contrast to the largely solitary delivery of her work until that point. For the Roses, in its final form, is a transition between masterpieces, with the starkness of Blue on one side and the jazzy full-band exuberance of 1974’s Court and Spark on the other. But as demonstrated on Archives, Vol. 3, the excellent latest entry in a series of releases that collect previously unreleased demos and alternate versions from her back catalog, she already had a germ of the Court and Spark sound in mind when she began recording its predecessor.",Rock,8.6
725,"The band’s imposing, precarious new album cements them in a history of North Carolina bands making thrilling indie rock. For all that’s changed over the past 30 years, you can still take comfort in certain recurring phenomena, like Martin Scorsese movies that require booking an afternoon off work and North Carolina acts raising the bar for unkempt yet emotionally stirring indie rock. When charting the genre’s trajectory this year, all roads lead to the greater Asheville area, which has yielded pace-setting albums like Wednesday’s raggedly glorious Rat Saw God and Indigo de Souza’s charmingly eclectic All of This Will End. Now, their Raleigh compatriots Truth Club complete the 2023 Triangle triangle: Frequent showmates with the former and occasional collaborators with the latter, the band also shares custody of Asheville studio ace Alex Farrar. But if Wednesday are like the Superchunk-esque rallying point of the current NC scene, then Truth Club are like the more enigmatic and forbidding Polvo, deploying more oblique strategies to similarly arresting ends.Running From the Chase is technically Truth Club’s second album, but it captures a moment of spiritual rebirth for the band. While recording 2019’s wily and wiry Not an Exit, the founding trio of singer and guitarist Travis Harrington, bassist Kameron Vann, and drummer Elise Jaffe tapped Yvonne Chazal for additional songwriting support. Chazal officially joined upon Not an Exit’s release, and her addition effectively reformulated the band’s DNA, encouraging a more open collaborative process and increasingly unconventional strategies. Their debut presented a band teetering between classic ‘90s slack-rock and second-wave emo; Running From the Chase both builds upon that foundation while redrafting the architecture, integrating DIY sound experiments—from the floor-scraping sounds of a musical-chairs competition to cymbals being driven over by cars—into songs as imposing and precarious as Jenga towers.This isn’t simple fucking-around for the sake of it—Truth Club’s alternately lurching and liberating dynamics reflect hard-fought struggles with mental health. Several songs on Running From the Chase begin abruptly, thrusting you directly into Harrington’s turbulent headspace. But after these sudden entries, it can take a moment to acclimate to the band’s slow-stalking movements and shapeshifting songcraft, where wandering, half-spoken vocal lines gradually swell into fulsome melodies and stray guitar patterns intertwine into delicately latticed tapestries. They approach these songs as if their very survival was dependent on conserving their strength: “Suffer Debt” is like a 4-7-8 breathing exercise in musical form, receding and surging at increasingly dramatic intervals. Harrington paints a vivid portrait of trying to keep your shit together when your mind won’t let you rest while also interrogating the very process of turning personal trauma into public entertainment: Three minutes in, the band suddenly shifts gear into a raucously grungy denouement where he abandons the poetic similes to speak more bluntly. “Sometimes it feels so bad I can’t even express myself/I don’t even know where to start,” he declares.Running From the Chase is rife with similarly scabrous sentiments that go down like broken glass. As the title track makes clear, the reward for drumming up the courage to leave the house is getting your soul crushed by your day job (“Work until he’s dead/ work until we’re dead/Is there any other plan?”). “Is This Working?” transforms that existential quandary into riot-stoking unrest: “Each day: wake, worry, watch,” Harrington seethes. “Is this working?/Are you working hard?/Is it working for you?” But Truth Club never seem fully paralyzed by their pessimism: Running From the Chase also offers up adrenalized, fuzzbox-kicking rave-ups (“Blue Eternal”) that function as necessary pressure-release valves, and slow-burning moments like “Exit Cycle,” where Truth Club push back against the darkness. “Hopelessness asserts itself/Not the last time,” Harrington cautions, though he sounds less defeated than prepared for battle, while de Souza joins him on the frontline. Running From the Chase is an often agitated response to a world intent on draining you of your energy, but it’s also a reminder of the beauty in a community.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

726,"Gathering inspiration from Maltese folk and ’70s psych-rock, the UK-based band makes complex, ambitious post-punk with the chaotic energy of an informal jam. The sound of art-punk quartet ĠENN reflects their collective experience: tenacious drum lines from UK post-punk, sinuous vocal melodies inspired by Maltese folk music, and the heavy guitars of modern psych-rock or even nu-metal. Formed in Malta before moving to Brighton, the quartet has played together for a decade, releasing an album titled Titty Monster under the name Cryptic Street in 2018. On Unum, their debut as ĠENN, the group balances their uneasy search for identity with a confident presentation. It’s an ambitious record that still leaves room for mischief.Leading the charge is songwriter and vocalist Leona Farrugia, who draws on the alienation that comes with being an outsider to examine the search for identity. “Rohmeresse” begins on a deadpan group chorus (“I wanna stay in all day, I wanna sleep in all day, all day!”), then shifts into wordless, exploratory prog rock. On the chorus of “Heloise,” Janelle Borg incorporates downtuned nu-metal guitar, drummer Sofia Rose Cooper borrows from math rock, and bassist Leanne Zammit leans into ’70s prog, while Farrugia’s howls of romantic obsession channel Karen O and Sue Tompkins simultaneously. Unexpected touches like the clave accent on “A Muse (In Limbo)” or the birdbrained zoneout “Le Saut du Pigeon” play like endearing inside jokes, relieving the musical tension. It’s undoubtedly a studio record, but one with the chaotic energy of an informal jam.On less dense songs, there’s less to hide behind, and the straightforward approach produces more mixed results. “Days and Nights,” led by Zammit’s snaking bassline, is an old-fashioned rocker about contemporary uncertainty, with a great line about “strolling aimlessly with a heightened desire to survive.” “A Reprise (That Girl)” is all-out dance-punk complete with handclaps and deadpan sprechgesang, where satirical judgements about social-media influencers give way to a larger proclamation: “Death upon the mundane!” But while “Rohmeresse” invokes French New Wave director Éric Rohmer by name, the lyrics could fit any filmmaker known for depicting modern ennui.ĠENN’s frenetic, jagged riffs and discursive arrangements are as arresting as those of any band working in the same space. Great as the bluster sounds, though, its purpose is not always clear. There are moments of deeper insight (about the way capitalism bleeds over into relationships on “The Merchant Of,” or the solace to be found in peeling potatoes on “Rohmeresse”), but it’s never revelatory in the same way as the band’s best arrangements. Unum still covers an impressive amount of ground in 40 minutes: ĠENN have a knack for embedding accessible hooks and silly musical details within complex and unconventional structures. There are worse foundations to build upon.",Rock,7.0
727,"With an elliptical and bewitching new album, Taja Cheek turns her expansive, introspective compositions toward surreal humor and playfulness. On the title track of her third album as L’Rain, Taja Cheek chants, “I killed your dog.” The repetition of the four words sounds dissociative at first; as Cheek croons through a scrim of vocal processing, a tinge of regret seems to enter her voice. But her unsettling lyrics and eerily overdubbed vocals hint at a stranger picture. “I felt the blood drip from my teeth,” Cheek’s narrator says. “I felt the waves hitting my face.” Eventually, Cheek twists the proverbial knife: “It made me happy,” the killer confesses, the disclosure followed by sinister laughs that float through an abyss of languid synths and sax. And she’s not done yet. In the closing seconds, Cheek gets surreal, singing “I am your dog.”This is the theatrical, elliptical, and bewitching mood of I Killed Your Dog, which revamps L’Rain’s typically introspective music into baroque dreamscapes. After exploring the peculiar weight of grief and the weary labor of self-improvement on her first two albums, the singer and multi-instrumentalist turns her attention to another kind of interiority: passion. The intense emotion adds flair and drama to her layered songs, centering the playfulness once pushed to the margins of her music. Only one fictional pet gets snuffed, but the whole album is bolder and brasher than previous L’Rain records, every harmony, loop, and skit engorged with verve. Cheek has figured out how to maintain her slippery, impressionistic style while also letting it be known she’s got that dog in her.Cheek and her cadre of session musicians establish the album’s beguiling mode early. “Our Funeral” head-fakes as a torch song, floating Cheek’s rich lower register over plaintive keys and flickering synths. But Cheek’s lament to a doomed relationship is curiously eager. “End of days/Are you ready?” she repeats as if calling forth a vengeful god, a cauldron of snaps, melodies, and drums burbling beneath her. This breakup doesn’t just feel like the end of the world; it beckons it. Single “Pet Rock” is outwardly flip, offering wry metacommentary on the erasure of Black people in rock over nimble, Strokes-style guitar melodies. “You know/I’m invisible/Cut the bullshit/And make me into/Something else,” Cheek sings. The fact that she’s the guitarist heightens the irony.I Killed Your DogHumor, explicit and subtle, functions as the album’s Rosetta Stone. In the brief skit “What’s That Song?,” someone asks for help figuring a jazz song. “I know it sounds like all of them,” they say after crudely mimicking the melody. Seconds later, a full band blips in to actually play the song, their rich tones snapping the imitation to life and underscoring the condescension of the question. The bit, reminiscent of Adult Swim commercial bumps, is extremely funny—especially if you’ve ever been the goof mangling a half-remembered tune. Cheek has said she set out to make the “exact opposite” of experimental music that is heady and untouchable, and the immediacy of comedy suits that mission.",Experimental,8.7
728,"The Oakland songwriter pairs abstract imagery with elegant arrangements on her dreamy, open-ended second album. Carly Bond, who records as Meernaa, describes her songwriting process as “psychedelic meditation,” an experience so immersive that when she gets into the flow, she forgets to eat. On her debut, 2019’s Heart Hunger, playful guitar solos and kaleidoscopic production lent the music that boundless exploratory feeling. Her follow-up, So Far So Good, is a more soulful, introspective collection of folk songs whose fingerpicked guitar, gauzy synth lines, and swooping string arrangements diffuse like smoke.If meditation has a goal, it’s to be able to witness your emotions passing by rather than letting them overwhelm or control you. Bond’s lyrics adopt a similar perspective. They are full of yearning, but they maintain an observational stance. Bond rarely editorializes her feelings, instead collaging abstract imagery to gesture at them, so listening feels less like reading a dream journal than watching an experimental film interpretation of your own dreams. (I’m reminded of avant-garde filmmaker Maya Deren and Alexandr Hackenschmied’s short film Meshes of the Afternoon, which silently tells and retells a dream sequence, changing small details with each repetition.)In her songwriting, Bond tends to pull from a recurring pool of phrases—“dreams,” “tenderness,” “the heart”—and pastes them together without much focus on narrative linearity. Rather than feeling disorienting or incomplete, the disparate images build into surprisingly poignant wholes. On “As Many Birds Flying,” Bond drifts through a chugging guitar riff and bandmate Rob Shelton’s ribbons of synth as she recalls water flowing, a sky turning lavender, and a lover’s voice echoing through a canyon. The scenes pass without much explanation, but together they establish a sense of outsized wonder at love she once experienced but can no longer access.On “Mirror Heart,” Bond describes various aspects of someone’s face without using sight: Each feature is a stand-in for an emotion it evokes, from the tenderness in their eyes to the wildness in their smile. When love and longing are so intense and amorphous that language falls short, the writing on So Far So Good creates a constellation of tiny moments that speak to those grand feelings. Bond catches the glimmer in someone’s eye or watches them turn over a stone in their hands, then asks us to connect the dots with our own associations.Her voice, too, conveys a wordless longing. On opener “On My Line,” she sings about anxiously awaiting a phone call, but decides to bury her feelings. A grinding guitar riff flares and percussionist Andrew Maguire’s drums simmer as Bond escalates from a cautious falsetto to a wail, using restraint and patience to relay a sense of barely contained frustration. “Bhuta Kala” is a plea to someone else to linger in a state of mutual reverie. Here, her singing meshes so seamlessly with the starry guitar and strings that it might feel like the sounds are emerging from the same instrument.Throughout the album, Bond yearns for love but is rarely able to grasp it. There is no resolution, just a fog of memories and elliptical dream logic. But despite the intensity of the emotion, the symphonic, elegant arrangements make her words feel accessible and inviting. On So Far So Good, she provides a scaffolding of impressions upon which we are invited to impart our own narratives, making this music ours, too.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

729,"On his fourth album helming the Brooklyn chamber folk ensemble, Jordan Lee brings a watchmaker’s precision to a baroque sound typically associated with billowy grandeur. It takes a true optimist to see the upside of a wildfire. Throughout Growing at the Edges, the bottomlessly tender fourth album from his baroque indie project Mutual Benefit, Jordan Lee conjures angry skies, scorched earth, and suffocating smoke, yet somehow the destruction only strengthens his sense of serenity and wonder. In Lee’s world, every catastrophe is an opportunity for regrowth and renewal. As he spells it out hopefully on the title track, “Peeking from a seed, where there was a wasteland, something new.”Lee sees a kindred spirit in that charred soil, as he avails himself of new mindsets and healthier outlooks in the face of change. The Brooklyn-based singer-songwriter spent five years writing these songs, but he insists it was only late in the process that he realized he was writing a love album—which is wild, given how impossible it is to listen to Growing at the Edges and miss the romance. The entire album is blanked in a lavender haze. Between Lee’s chivalrous quiver and the serenading string arrangements, every song lands like a softly blown kiss in a silent film.The florid accompaniments of Mutual Benefit’s previous records carry over, but Growing at the Edges bears a much more pronounced imprint of jazz and classical, in no small degree due to the input of multi-instrumentalist Gabriel Birnbaum and violinist/string arranger Concetta Abbate. Lee says he took inspiration from his time listening to New York jazz radio during the pandemic, and if that makes him sound like a tourist, he demonstrates an aficionado’s appreciation of the genre’s subtleties. The record is never more serene than when he clears space to revel in the gentle explorations of Birnbaum’s saxophone. In their brushed drums and blushing upright bass, Growing’s most serene tracks evoke the levitating rhythms of Richard Davis and Connie Kay on Van Morrison’s Astral Weeks. There are shades, too, of Neil Young’s Harvest Moon and Willie Nelson’s Stardust in the delicate, tuxedo-tailed twang of “Beginner’s Heart” and “Little Ways.” And in the watchmaker’s intricacy of its arrangements, there are echoes of Grizzly Bear’s Veckatimist, albeit with none of the tension or toil. Grizzly Bear’s songs always showed their work; they wanted you to hear the protractors and composition books involved in their meticulous creation. Mutual Benefit’s songs are no less exactingly composed, yet they offer the illusion they materialized from dreams. One way to enjoy the record is to marvel at its sheer precision—how each song stands alone as its own perfectly bundled bouquet, even while their shared lyrical and musical motifs form the impression of a seamless suite. But for all its craftsmanship, this is an album that thinks with its heart. “I love how you will dance around the entire room to a song that only you hear,” Lee swoons on the waltzing “Wasteland Companions,” and in some ways the whole record feels like his attempt to honor the free spirit modeled by his partner—to turn off his overactive brain and indulge the possibility of hope, even in a world where so much can and does go wrong.Over the last decade and a half, it’s been easy to become inured to records as gorgeous as this. As indie pop matured from the busted symphonics of Elephant 6 into the conservatory-trained chamber music of artists like Sufjan Stevens, Fleet Foxes, and San Fermin—and as the stray string accompaniments that periodically graced indie projects swelled into full ensembles—it grew harder be wowed by the grandeur and sophistication of it all. So perhaps Growing at the Edges’ greatest trick is rekindling the sense of romance and connection all that splendor can evoke. Its arrangements are lavish but never demanding, vibrant but never loud, decadent but never distracting. They do so much, yet never so much that they risk disrupting the record’s carefully understated sense of enchantment.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

730,"A new compilation explores the early days of Elliott Smith's alt-rock band, whose tight songcraft and introspective lyrics set the stage for his solo work to come. When Elliott Smith and his college buddy Neil Gust formed Heatmiser in Portland in the early ’90s, all the pieces started falling into place. They had two supremely talented songwriters, a thrashing yet tuneful alt-rock sound, and a local following from their sold-out performances at the local club La Luna. Onstage, they were “just a phenomenal, rip-your-head-off-and-shove-it-up-your-ass rock band,” the group’s manager, JJ Gonson, later recalled.So, what happened? Elliott Smith happened. Relations within Heatmiser deteriorated during the recording of their third album, 1996’s Mic City Sons, and the band broke up just as Smith’s solo career was taking off. Within two years, he was performing at the Oscars while his old band was relegated to coulda-been status. Now, 30 years after Heatmiser’s debut, 1993’s Dead Air, a sprawling, 29-track compilation takes stock of their fiery early recordings and fills in some blanks, making a persuasive case for their undersung greatness.Heatmiser—rounded out by bassist Brandt Peterson and drummer/engineer Tony Lash—were exhilarating from their first 1992 demo, which comprises the first six tracks here, four of which appeared in slightly more polished form on Dead Air. Each song got in and out in about two minutes and would’ve fit on any college radio playlist in the country. “Lowlife” is a pounding statement of intent, led by Smith’s youthful torment (“I’ve got a plague/Plague in my head”), while “Buick” showcases Gust’s twangier delivery and more narrative-driven songwriting. On “Dirt,” the two singers trade lines and egg each other on, sounding remarkably like Ian MacKaye and Guy Picciotto of Fugazi. Similarly, the previously unheard “Just a Little Prick,” with its hulking bass groove, could pass for a Repeater outtake.Both Smith and Gust sound consumed with angst and self-loathing. Gust grappled with his alienation as a gay man, a subject he addresses obliquely on “Candyland” and “Can’t Be Touched” (“They’re all so straight they’d swear the earth was flat/And that the bend is in my head,” he sings on the latter). Smith, who removed feminine pronouns from some of his love songs in solidarity with his friend, confronts his own disillusionment with masculinity on “Man Camp,” a darkly funny skewering of the mythopoetic men’s movement.Despite its definitive title, The Music of Heatmiser is not a career-spanning set. The focus is on Heatmiser’s early recordings, demos, and live cuts from 1992 and 1993, when they played an intense, somewhat derivative brand of post-hardcore, borrowing from trailblazers like Hüsker Dü, Nation of Ulysses, and of course Fugazi. Smith’s vocal style back then—gruff, loud, deep—will come as a shock to anyone only familiar with his solo records. His contributions to Heatmiser’s later albums, particularly Mic City Sons, offer hints of his folk-pop melodicism, but you won’t find any of them here. Instead, we get a charming cover of the Beatles’ “Revolution” and a live recording of the band’s 1993 set on KBOO—a compelling document of their live prowess that’s also a bit repetitive, since most of the tracks also appear on the compilation in demo form.In retrospect, Smith’s rise as a solo artist seems so preordained that it’s easy to forget how unfashionable his hushed, acoustic style seemed in the mid-’90s. As Smith once reflected, “I thought my head would be chopped off immediately when [Roman Candle] came out because it was so opposite to the grunge thing that was popular.” If it was Smith’s willingness to buck trends that made his records stand out, then Heatmiser had the opposite problem. They were great, but they sounded like a lot of other fashionable bands, too, struggling to fully break out from the pack. The Music of Heatmiser conveys what was so compelling about the band in its nascent period and what was soon to come from Smith: They had caterwauling energy and angst to spare, yes, but they also had the songs.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

731,"On his new mixtape, the Flint rapper continues his run as a solid flagbearer for his city’s rap scene. It’s a tight and punchline-driven offering, marred by occasionally stiff delivery. In the summer of 2020, the freak show that is Flint’s street rap scene blossomed. Three of the city’s landmark rap songs dropped within the span of a few months, all featuring the scene’s signature blend of depraved, punchline-driven comedy and unorthodox delivery. The tracks in question were YN Jay and Louie Ray’s “Coochie,” Rio Da Yung OG and Louie Ray’s “Movie,” and BFB Da Packman’s team-up with out-of-towner Sada Baby on “Free Joe Exotic.” Just a year later, things started to slow down, as Rio, the nucleus of the movement, began a five-year prison sentence. In the years since, there have been noteworthy tracks and mixtapes here and there, but without its defining star, the scene started to splinter, and its energy floundered.Enter Babyfxce E. During Flint’s big summer of 2020, he was a freshly minted high school grad who hadn’t yet stepped into a recording booth. Last year, seemingly overnight, he became his hometown’s newest ambassador with a run of singles backed by sharp wisecracks and wordplay. While the bars are colorful, Babyfxce lacks an identifiable vocal presence. The competition is tough: He has to contend with local staples like RMC Mike, who sounds like he gargles whiskey instead of mouthwash, and KrispyLife Kidd, who can always make jaws drop. In a city full of borderline cartoon characters, Babyfxce is a smooth talker. That quality has turned him into a solid flagbearer for the Flint rap sound, as his less abrasive—and by extension less exciting—take on the style is easier for the uptight music world to digest.On Babyfxce E’s newest project, The X Tape, he leans into that role. It’s tight and barely over 30 minutes, heavy on what made this era of Flint pop: the shit talk. E’s got that down, with an active imagination that produces some twistedly funny one-liners. He cracks jokes at your debt (“I did made more money in this rap shit than your student loans” on “Rich Talking”), and dreams up absurd scenarios where he gets freaky with a pregnant woman and wonders if he just went too deep. (We need to enroll him in a sex ed course, pronto.) He’s at his best when he doesn’t waste too much time on the hook, and locks into a zone where each subsequent punchline amplifies the intensity. The pummeling “Chicken Little” is a good example: As the crackling beat escalates, the bars start flying faster. Or take the 40-yard dash “Hot Outside”; in a thrilling three-second rush toward the end of the song, it feels like his verse is about to end. Instead, he catches his breath and finds a second gear.",Rap,6.5
732,"The Brooklyn rapper and former beauty influencer has charisma to spare on her swaggering, stylish debut. In the music video for her breakout single “Telfy,” Maiya The Don shimmies down the aisle of a beauty store in Crocs, flexes her designer handbag, and gets sturdy with her girls at a playground. The Brooklyn rapper has the type of charisma that demands to be recorded. She got her start as an influencer and beautician on TikTok, where her wig tutorials and “get ready with me” vlogs quickly built her a loyal following. Rap was something she loved, but she never pursued it seriously until the runaway success of her menacing 2021 track “Chiraq.” On her new album, Hot Commodity, she expands her irresistible personality, approaching East Coast bully rap with the confidence of a Sephora manager.Maiya shows off her undeniable New York swagger as she calls out faceless haters and dumb men over beats that range from fast-paced street rap to Nicki Minaj-esque pop-rap. These subjects are well-worn, but her brash tone and creative delivery keep things fresh. On “Dusties,” she interpolates both Ice Spice and Lil Kim while dropping clever esthetician bars: “Bitches tryna make up, knowing we don’t blend.” On the hook for opener “Hella Scary,” she zig-zags through producer D.A. Got That Dope’s 808s, bubble pops, and finger snaps while clearing her nemeses: “Lotta rap hoes wack, these the same ol’ tracks/Wouldn’t pop even if you put Drake on that.”But Maiya hits differently on earnest love songs. “Got me ignoring DMs/I might just be your BM,” she says on the sample drill track “Luv U Better,” playing friends with benefits with Queens drill rapper Shawny Binladen. Things escalate further on songs like “In Your Hands” and “Call Me If You Down,” where she asserts her freedom (“I don’t gotta deal with you, I could fuck your friends”) while still catching feelings. But even at her most tender, Maiya never simps; she lays out the ground rules, but she’s perfectly content to keep it moving if her man’s not willing to shower her in affection and designer brands.Maiya sounds great on just about every beat. She rides the luxe instrumentals of “Into Myself” and “Telfy” with bravado; she slinks her way through the middling digital funk of the Ty Dolla $ign-featuring “In Your Hands,” the project’s sole weak spot; and she keeps pace with the breakneck sample drill of “Luv U Better” and “Body.” The latter is a chest-thumping roll call for people who want to test Maiya’s patience, delivered over a sample of Mariah Carey’s bubbly 2009 hit “Touch My Body.”Hot Commodity operates from a similar blueprint as Cardi’s B’s 2017 mixtape Gangsta Bitch Music Vol. 2 and Megan Thee Stallion’s 2018 breakout Tina Snow: It’s a focused and punchy sample platter of regional styles that proves Maiya is capable of holding her own. By the time she’s breaking down her origin story—growing up on the intersection of Macon Street and Marcus Garvey Boulevard, raising her siblings in and out of foster care—it’s clear that she’s interested in more than just flexing her fabulousness. “I can’t put a price on this; I put my life in it/My story ain’t finished because nigga, I’m still writing it,” she says, growing from despondent to triumphant over the course of two bars. By this point, she's left the comforts of BeautyTok for a real world takeover.",Rap,7.6
733,"The Pulitzer-nominated experimental producer finesses acoustic samples from the Third Coast Percussion ensemble into dazzling rhythmic workouts. In the six years since Jlin’s last proper album, the genre-shattering Black Origami, the bounds of her musical practice have exploded. With conceptual artist Kevin Beasley, she transfigured the sounds of a cotton gin that Beasley installed at the Whitney Museum and performed in the gallery alongside the machine. Her soundtrack to choreographer Wayne McGregor’s Autobiography underscored the power of her music to inspire movement outside the club. Kronos Quartet, fixtures of the contemporary classical vanguard, commissioned the gutsy, virtuosic “Little Black Book,” which required cellist Sunny Yang to stomp out Jlin’s heavily syncopated beats on an actual kick drum while she ripped into a contrasting bassline.Despite the diversity of these collaborations, and their footing in institutional contexts, they retain all the grit and ingenuity that have been Jlin’s signature since she emerged on the fringes of footwork over a decade ago. The tessellating rhythmic cryptograms that made Black Origami an enigma worth both pondering over and dancing to have remained central, even if they fill a concert hall rather than a nightclub. Her new EP Perspective, a collaboration with Third Coast Percussion, is a more complex venture that moves in multiple directions at once.The project began with Jlin recording raw materials in the Chicago ensemble’s studio. “It was bliss for me,” she recently told Passion of the Weiss. “I went there and I got as many sounds as I could: the marimbas, the xylophones, a lot of bells and bowls. We were there for eight, 12 hours… I have a whole library of these sounds.” She imported these raw materials into FL Studio, where she sculpted them into bouncing backbeats, adrenaline-rush whirrs of high end, and majestic pulsations. She gave her compositions—which were nominated for the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for music—to the four members of Third Coast to translate back into their own language; the title reflects the idea of approaching the same material from different angles.On Third Coast Percussion’s recording, released last year, they occasionally sounded hesitant, as if more focused on keeping up with the score than harnessing the elation that produced it. But the obvious joy Jlin felt in the process of creating this music shines through in these electronic versions—not only in the emotions conveyed, but in the depth and detail of the productions. Where Third Coast’s recording was limited to the acoustic timbres available to the ensemble and the physical limitations of their playing, Jlin’s originals, which Third Coast based their own versions on, employ a staggering range of frequencies, from body rumbling sub-bass to chirping melodic accents so high-pitched they might not be audible to many listeners over a certain age.",Electronic,7.9
734,"The Los Angeles-based harpist’s songs remain characteristically serene and steeped in nostalgia, though guests like the Cure’s Lol Tolhurst and Slowdive’s Rachel Goswell add nuance to her sound. Listening to a Mary Lattimore album is like flipping through a scrapbook full of yellowing photographs. For the Los Angeles-based harpist, no moment is too trivial to capture in music: the lone deer she saw in the woods during a residency stay, the Wawa from a road trip. On albums like 2017’s Collected Pieces and 2020’s Silver Ladders she codified her style, transforming stories from her travels into wistful odes meant to evoke the feeling of a resurfaced memory. With Goodbye, Hotel Arkada, she invites an array of collaborators to help craft pensive songs that grow out of moments past. While her instrument’s luminous tone remains the music’s defining characteristic, she embraces a darker mood than before.Goodbye, Hotel Arkada takes its name from a formerly grand hotel on the Croatian island of Hvar where Lattimore once roamed the empty hallways, imagining the majesty of its glory days. She later learned from a friend that the place had been gutted and modernized, and the news prompted this album-length tribute to faded grace. Not all her inspirations are as somber as her often stately music might suggest, however: “And Then He Wrapped His Wings Around Me” was inspired by a childhood encounter with an actor in a life-sized Big Bird costume, while “Music for Applying Shimmering Eye Shadow,” which she wrote as pre-show music for green-room rituals, grew out of an investigation in the theoretical sound of space.Despite the range of her inspirations, Lattimore’s music is uniformly moody and slightly ambiguous. She plays at a leisurely pace and cloaks each pluck in reverb, giving the feeling that her music is floating. Her melodies often favor the high, twinkling pitches of her instrument; they sway rather than leap, transmitting a feeling of reverence. And as they repeat, they expand, crescendoing with each reiteration. On “Arrivederci,” which Lattimore wrote after being fired from a gig, former Cure keyboardist Lol Tolhurst’s synths add murkiness, bass notes swelling underneath Lattimore’s slow lament. The lilting phrases of closer “Yesterday’s Parties” feel dreamy at first, but as the song grows, Samara Lubelski’s flickering violin riffs cut across airy vocals from Slowdive’s Rachel Goswell, stirring a little bit of chaos into the soothing lullaby.Yet even in moments where a melody becomes turbulent, Lattimore’s compositions can feel relentlessly pretty. Her music avoids disorder; she carefully weaves sweet passages together and always ends with an upbeat tone. But with “Blender in a Blender,” Lattimore allows for some frayed edges. When writing the track, she recalled a conversation in which she and a friend wondered what sorts of physical objects could be put in a blender. Glow sticks, iPhones; could even a blender be blended? Her harp feels its featheriest here, soaring above Roy Montgomery’s hazy guitar. But then, after a moment of silence, Montgomery’s guitar returns with force, churning in a distorted blur. It’s a refreshing reminder that despite her music’s nostalgic cast, it doesn’t have to be bogged down by it. It can make room for humor, too.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

735,"What exactly was the Darkness? A 20th-anniversary reissue of their meteoric debut album reaffirms their pop-metal bona fides. The Darkness pursued rock stardom in the same way that people nowadays strive to be pro running backs or music journalists: headlong, and without care for how the position is currently valued. As East Anglian teenagers in the early ’90s—with alt-rock and baggy Madchester in commercial ascendance—brothers Dan and Justin Hawkins were obsessed with the heavy acts of their childhoods. They pored over Brian May’s guitar tone, Aerosmith’s album sequencing (always close with a power ballad), and the proper design of catsuits. Dan cut his teeth playing outmoded styles like thrash metal and prog, moving from drums to bass when he joined Justin’s covers band. It was a part-time gig for Justin; in 1997 he had started a business composing soundalikes for commercials: tunes that would suggest their sources without being legally actionable. It was this work that bankrolled the recording of the Darkness’ 2003 debut, Permission to Land: a defiantly unfashionable set of glammy, cheeky hard rock that briefly made the band the toast of UK pop.At the turn of the 21st century, there was no shortage of acts mining musical comedy from the same rocks as the Darkness. In England, the band was preceded by the self-mythologizing Wildhearts, who mixed an omnivorous ‘60s pop sensibility with buzzsaw rock‘n’roll. Scandinavia boasted punked-up glam from the likes of the Hives, Backyard Babies, and Turbonegro. America had Satanicide (a scraggly-wigged, live hair-metal act for NY hipsters), Tenacious D (the absurdist pomp-rock duo of Kyle Gass and Jack Black), and Steel Panther (an international festival draw that rendered the cock-rock deathstyle with grim fidelity). But the Darkness were distinguished by their ambition. In sound and bearing, they presented as chart royalty; they were committed to the bit on a cellular level. They took rock-as-form very seriously, which freed them to be frivolous everywhere else.Roughly timed to the 20th anniversary of the album’s US release, Permission to Land… Again doesn’t complicate the legacy of the Darkness. Instead, it honors it by providing more: more twin-guitar flash, more careening falsetto, more high-concept rockers. From the beginning, The Darkness walked a tightrope between the dual skyscrapers of Queen and AC/DC. At one end, haughty yet humane grandeur; at the other, snarling, cranked-up minimalism. Difficult enough work, but the real highwire act were the faces the band pulled along the line. The Darkness never fully embraced the comedy-rock label; being wiseasses just came naturally. Like a Kerrang!-approved Sparks, they spliced surging glam rock and power ballads with lyrics about jerking off and the existential unfairness of contracting an STI. Even if the texts weren’t especially clever, their deployment often was.",Metal,8.2
736,"Three shows recorded at Minneapolis club Jay’s Longhorn between 1979 and 1980 capture a raw snapshot of a young band in flux, brimming with confidence and hopped up on speed. By the end of the 1970s, disco was dying, and the Twin Cities were at the dawn of a renaissance. Freeform radio had given way to commercial programming, but in Minneapolis and St. Paul, a punk and new wave scene was taking shape, growing by word of mouth and metastasizing in record shops like Oar Folkjokeopus and clubs like Jay’s Longhorn. When the young trio of Bob Mould, Grant Hart, and Greg Norton played there for the first time, the scene was nascent—First Avenue’s hallowed 7th Street Entry was still the coat closet for the disco club Uncle Sam’s. But those early Hüsker Dü sets at the Longhorn revealed a group quickly becoming fluent in punk and hardcore, foreshadowing a future in which their mastery of hooks and harmonies would transcend genre. It was the first time they’d felt like the real thing.Tonite Longhorn collects three of those early shows recorded between July 1979 and September 1980, as the band immersed itself in the breakneck thrash that would become the foundation of its sound. They were recorded by engineer and archivist Terry Katzman, who co-founded Reflex Records with Hüsker Dü after their first single was rejected by Jay’s Longhorn DJ Peter Jesperson’s label Twin/Tone. Katzman’s massive trove of Hüsker Dü recordings made up the bulk of the 2017 box set Savage Young Dü, a 69-track collection of mostly live and previously unreleased music from ’79-’82. Alternate versions of most of the songs on Tonite Longhorn can also be found on Savage Young Dü, rendering this collection largely inessential for all but the most obsessive fans. But while the 2017 set serves as a completist’s document of their early years, Tonite Longhorn is more focused, an even rawer snapshot of the young band in flux, brimming with confidence and hopped up on speed.Much like the Savage Young Dü recordings, the tapes are a bit rough; Norton’s bass often gets lost in the mix, and the vocals sound very much like they were recorded in a makeshift rock club in the ’70s. But the drums and cymbals cut through like gunshots and lightning, and the deeper you get the more the lo-fi analog aesthetic becomes transportive, making it easier to picture a 20-year-old Mould spewing vitriol into a mic from the stage of a former steakhouse that once hosted progressive jazz. The only exact duplicate that Norton—who produced Tonite Longhorn—included from Savage Young Dü is the opener “Insects Rule the World,” the first song from their first set at the Longhorn, and arguably the moment that defines their POV in this era. “We’re not the most professional band in the Twin Cities,” Hart admits as the song comes to a close, before Mould chimes in: “...but we have fun though.”",Rock,7.3
737,"On his eighth album, a skillful Drake struggles to keep it interesting. His familiar concerns, while occasionally sincere or funny, have become quite boring. Whither Drake, the brokenest man in music? The golden bachelor emerged from pandemic lockdown and unleashed a whirlwind of creativity with three albums that explored Afrobeats, club music, and trap, all while sending his emo fuckboy persona into increasingly darker crevices. Long the jilted lover who lashed out at women in response, his chameleonic melodies—and his endless charisma—often overshadowed his soft emotional outbursts, with bouts of insight on moody ballads of the sort he built his name. “I’m still working on me, and I’m coming back better for you,” for instance, on Certified Lover Boy’s “Fucking Fans,” an empty promise inside a heartfelt journey through his infidelity and remorse.By Her Loss, though, his 2022 album with fellow wayward son 21 Savage, the sentiment had curdled. By putting famous women in his sights alongside the nameless proles in his contacts, his churlishness became more widely noticed—most specifically on “Circo Loco,” a bass track on which the line, “This bitch lie ’bout getting shots but she still a stallion,” was taken by fans and Megan Thee Stallion herself to mean both ass injections and a sideswipe at the Houston rapper. It also added to the shameful laundry list of male rappers who cast aspersions on whether Tory Lanez, now serving 10 years in North Kern State Prison, shot her.On For All the Dogs, Drake has yet again doubled down over a melange of styles—drill, underworld R&B, Playboi Carti’s flow—and other than a few flashes of brilliance, the music can’t save him from himself. Despite his agility on “8am in Charlotte” and a tuneful SZA verse on the otherwise mid Men Are From Mars tone poem “Slime You Out,” the meat of this bloated 23-track album are his own grievances and a dearth of topical contrast. Once again releasing an album with the runtime of a feature-length film, Dogs is an unfocused, disjointed listen loosely tied to the undercooked conceit that the album is playing on a fictional quiet storm radio station—BARK Radio—hosted by DJs Snoop Dogg, George Clinton, and, miraculously, the Sade Adu, who shows up to do a brief radio tag.Another wobbly peg seems to be Drake working through some kind of awful island vacation, which he makes sound like his own emotional Fyre Festival. It appears on the Savage-featuring “Callin For You,” in the form of a skit about flying economy, which is entirely sampled from Rye Rye on “Shake It to the Ground,” the Baltimore club classic she made with DJ Blaqstarr when she was just 15. The lounge-adjacent “Bahamas Promises” addresses “Hayley” with signature Drake corn—“You put the ‘no’ in monogamy.” Whether or not the vacation exists is a question for the tabloids, yet there’s no question Rihanna is the topic of “Fear of Heights,” where Drake demonstrates how hurt he is by making a song about how not hurt he is. “Why do they make it sound like I’m still hung up on you? That could never be,” he raps, protesting entirely too much.",Rap,6.5
738,"Soundtracked by euphoric bubblegum synth, the PC Music star takes a deep dive into two-dimensionality. In 2013, the Oxford Dictionaries named “selfie” its word of the year. Not coincidentally, that’s also when hyperpop star and digital photographer Hannah Diamond debuted with the London label PC Music. Working alongside producer and label mastermind A. G. Cook, Diamond created high-concept electronic pop, as well as her own hyper-stylized, highly Photoshopped portraits. But a photo—even a bespoke self-portrait in sparkling high definition—can only tell you so much about a person. Perfect Picture, Diamond’s second and final album for the label, which will cease to release new music come January, is an earnest quest to capture her essence as a person and an artist—and a winking commentary on the construction of reality and the path to self-acceptance.Early in Diamond’s career, her chirpy, processed vocals and hyper-feminine, seemingly plastic persona led some observers to doubt her mere existence. Her 2019 debut, Reflections, didn’t do much to change that Vocaloid-like posture, and its arrival was overshadowed by the fact that most of its songs had already been released. Perfect Picture, produced by David Gamson (Kesha, Charli XCX), has a much warmer palette than its predecessor. What was once a crystalline shell of mourning for insecurities and broken online relationships has matured into a dial-up dream of early-aughts stardom made real in 2023. HD is past sounding high definition: Perfect Picture embraces a blurrier resolution where pitch-shifted vocals glitch in and out of static and punchy, arpeggiated synths leap into massive choruses. Even the relatively downtempo cuts (“Flashback,” “Unbreakable”) carry a fresh buoyancy.As Diamond steers away from the icy, sad-girl trappings of her earlier work, she morphs into a more upbeat, motivational pop star, something like Hilary Duff’s ’00s teenie-bop classic “What Dreams Are Made Of” by way of Eurodance hitmaker DJ Sammy and mid-tempo Britney deep cuts. If the connection between these oft-maligned pop gems isn’t readily obvious, their influence on Perfect Picture’s digitally mediated yet heartfelt emotional landscape is. “Want You to Know” is tinged with Eurodance, while the modulated backing vocals of Spears’ 2008 song “Unusual You” can be heard all over the record.Lyrically, Perfect Picture covers a lot of the same ground as Reflections with renewed optimism. Many songs are ostensibly about Diamond’s own experiences—references to pixels, touchscreens, and photo-editing tools abound. Almost all the songs are knowingly self-referential, and the meta humor that’s a PC Music signature serves to highlight the genuine emotion behind them. Diamond is still contemplating her flaws, targeting imposter syndrome in “Poster Girl” and “Lip Sync” and uncertain relationships in cuts like “Impossible” and “Divisible by Two.” Instead of wallowing, she draws newfound strength from the cracks in her self-image. “When I focus on what’s perfect/I never notice the imperfections in moments that make life so worth it,” she admits on “Poster Girl.” Time and again, Diamond reiterates that artifice doesn’t negate sincerity, just as her role in constructing it doesn’t vacate her agency.",Pop,7.8
739,"Gathering vintage compositions from 27 tape reels, this expansive new collection highlights the brief but fertile period, more than 50 years ago, when avant-garde electronic music took root in India. One night in 1969, 20,000 people gathered at the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad, in the Indian state of Gujarat, to witness a vision of the future: the Moog synthesizer. An audiovisual spectacle called Soundscape was taking place across campus, and students and faculty members played the instrument while those in attendance marveled at the cutting-edge technology. American composer David Tudor had arrived in India earlier that year; during his three-month residency, he installed the synthesizer, which had been shipped from New York in wooden crates, along with a Dual Ring Modulator, a Bode Frequency Shifter, and tape machines, and led workshops on the instrument. Like the European electronic music studios established in the 1950s, the NID’s space would become a hub for exploration, hosting students of various stripes to experiment with its tools’ endless capabilities.The first overview of this short-lived but groundbreaking period comes in the form of a tremendous new compilation, The NID Tapes: Electronic Music from India 1969-1972. The artist Paul Purgas discovered, reassembled, and digitized its 19 tracks from 27 tape reels, and the results are thrillingly varied. Across tape collages and soundtracks, improvisations and field recordings, the overarching feeling is one of restless curiosity. Gita Sarabhai’s two pieces—both simply titled “Gitaben’s Composition”—are emblematic of these studio investigations. Her first contribution features playful, cartoonish warbles reverberating in the ether. The latter takes us straight into the void, casting lambent, oscillating tones into a monolithic drone.Sarabhai was a musicologist and revered musician who came from an influential family that pushed for modernist changes in the country. The pedagogical philosophies they favored infused the principles of Maria Montessori and the Bauhaus with ideas of holistic training via Mahatma Gandhi. It was Sarabhai who oversaw Tudor’s residency, and even prior to this international exchange, she would play records from her personal collection—Western composers like John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen, Indian musicians like Ravi Shankar and Kesarbai Kerkar—over the PA system during the NID’s lunch hours. This stylistic mélange animates Atul Desai’s “Compositions,” whose commingling of percussion and effervescent bleeps channel his desire to seek naad—the ever-vibrating “essence of sound.” This isn’t so much a transition from past to present as an expression of music’s liberatory potential: Given the rigors and hierarchies inherent in learning the sitar or sarod, for example, the Moog symbolized a more egalitarian avenue for ecstatic stimulation of the mind, body, and spirit.On an All India Radio broadcast from 1970, Desai, a Hindustani classical vocalist and composer, and the filmmaker I.S. Mathur extolled the avant-garde composer Edgard Varèse; their reverence for the early-20th-century experimentalist is evident in Mathur’s own pieces. The desire to blend environmental sounds with electronics is the central premise behind the impish “My Birds,” while “Soundtrack of Shadow Play” is an invigorating slab of musique concrète in the lineage of Varèse’s Poème électronique. Without the actual theatrical performance to view, its recordings of balmy Indian percussion transform into acousmatic abstractions amid a sea of calming electronic tones. Elsewhere, Mathur’s “Once I Played a Tanpura” captures a scorching solo on the titular instrument. And for those wanting to feel stressed beyond belief, “Shadows of the Show” intermittently recalls the hypnotic illusion of a Shepard tone, continually rising in pitch and intensity as if continually on the verge of exploding.",The,8.0
740,"Acoustic guitarist Dan Knishkowy is joined by an improvisational quartet for an album of autumnal instrumental folk that meditates on self-knowledge and change. Dan Knishkowy has spent much of his career as Adeline Hotel exploring the breadth of his acoustic guitar, from the minimalist blues of 2016’s It’s Alright, Just the Same to the reflective folk of 2021’s Good Timing. But after writing seven solo guitar songs for his new record Hot Fruit, he couldn’t shake the thought that something was missing. So he reached out to friends to add their own improvisational touches, tapping electric guitarist Ryan El-Solh, bassist Carmen Q. Rothwell, drummer Jason Burger of the Brooklyn jazz trio Scree, and Office Culture’s Winston Cook-Wilson on piano. Each finished song feels like a guided journey, and the way in which these orchestral collaborations blossom along the edges ushers in a new era of spontaneity for Adeline Hotel.Knishkowy long aspired to write from a place of intuition; this time, that instinct finally comes across naturally. Drawing a blend of sweetness and sharpness out of his guitar, he summons the conflicted emotions of outgrowing one’s former self. His finger-plucking alternates gracefully between loud notes played with confidence and notes that hesitate to ring out until the last second, as if quelling their nerves. El-Solh, Rothwell, Burger, and Cook-Wilson read his cues like any good friend would; they play in unison with certain guitar sections to further highlight Adeline Hotel’s original strengths (“Big Al”), and during other parts spiral off to emphasize the freeform shapes he’s building (“Little Chili”). The finished arrangements simmer into a rich nectar of orchestral folk as affecting as Nick Drake’s pastoral classics or William Tyler’s wordless portraits.In the best moments on Hot Fruit, all four guest musicians integrate their ideas with Knishkowy’s at once, their colorful improvisations lacing around his nimble guitarwork like ribbons threaded into a bird’s nest. On opener “Beksul,” each addition fades into the frame: the calm scratching of a shaker that grows louder, individual piano notes that transform into heartfelt chords, plucks of upright bass that turn dewy and soulful. The beauty of this collaboration reaches its peak with the three-part suite “Seeing Yourself Seen.” Pedal steel lends the song a gentle sway as clarinet, flute, and strings—all arranged by El-Solh—trickle over Knishkowy’s autumnal acoustic guitar lines. The ease and unpredictability of the swells evoke the kinds of small, quotidian human interactions that inspire gratitude for life.On previous records, like 2021’s piano-driven The Cherries Are Speaking, Knishkowy sang in a soft timbre about devotion and isolation. There’s no singing on Hot Fruit, but what we lose in words, we gain in sound as themes of self-concept and change take shape in probing melodies. It all stems from the intimate way Knishkowy wields his guitar: deft fingers and a light touch, with an understanding for how space and silence bolsters the music. The rhythmic hook and twinkling trill of the title track relays the magic of curiosity; the slight shift into a downtrodden chord on “White Sands” alludes to a moment of doubt yet forges onward. The clarity of these guitar parts sets Hot Fruit apart from Adeline Hotel’s previous work. It’s one thing to set out to follow your intuition; it’s another to illustrate it so lucidly in song that fellow musicians can tap in and improvise along.",Folk,7.2
741,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit the Oakland rapper’s imperial ’90s peak with the Dangerous Crew, a slick and funky landmark of pimp rap. By 1991, Too $hort was the foul-mouthed face of Oakland rap. He was fresh off a massive three-album run—1987’s Born to Mack, 1988’s Life is…Too Short, 1990’s Short Dog’s in the House—that went a long way toward solidifying the Bay Area as a regional mecca for rap. His infamous pimp persona—originally inspired after he watched the 1973 movie The Mack—leaned and sprawled over seismic 808s, and laid the foundation for the future of mainstream rap on both coasts. And yet, his engineer and producer Al Eaton had bigger dreams. After a meeting with Felton Pilate—one of the producers behind the otherworldly rise of MC Hammer, whose third album, Please Hammer Don’t Hurt ’Em, went diamond that April—Eaton picked up the pop-rap blueprint that had bankrolled Hammer’s enormous staff, private jet, and 19 racehorses. That money was different.In 1992, still months before Dr. Dre would release his blockbuster debut The Chronic down in Los Angeles, Too $hort pulled up to Eaton’s studio to get to work on his next album, Shorty the Pimp. The engineer had a crossover plan. “Al gave me a speech about how he didn’t want anyone to say the n-word in his house,” claimed Too $hort in a 2012 interview. “And he didn’t want to make any ‘ghetto’ music.” Too $hort flat-out rejected Eaton’s “corny wack-ass pop” pivot: That wasn’t him. But Eaton wouldn’t budge, stalling studio sessions for days hoping $hort would give in.Eaton had forgotten that hip-hop’s roots remained regional, even as the commercialization of the genre had already begun. From moving cassettes out of the trunk of his car in the early ’80s to swapping stories with E-40 in a particularly feel-good 2020 Verzuz showdown, $hort has almost always prioritized putting Bay Area culture on wax, uncut, and that is partially why he’s experienced the sort of longevity that’s uncommon in a genre where aging isn’t celebrated. “I make more now than I did in 1989,” said Too $hort in 2021. “When I go do a show they pay way more than ever.” Blatant pop-rap songs have turned into relics; Too $hort held onto his locality and his music became timeless.Too $hort, born Todd Shaw, was raised primarily on three things: the violent, profanity-fueled thrills of Blaxploitation cinema, the outsider funk of George Clinton, and talking his shit at all costs. He came of age in East Oakland, where pimp culture was unavoidable and crack was beginning to decimate the blocks as the Reagan administration left Black communities out to dry. Schooled on New York imports like the long-winded narratives of “Rapper’s Delight” and Spoonie Gee’s dirty player anthems of the 1980s, $hort was a slick and nasty rhymer from the jump. He laid down anecdotes about local pimps and small-time drug dealers with vivid detail and outrageously dark humor in an unhurried flow, the way a teacher might read a story to their class. (Don’t forget his catchphrase “bitch,” said in a one-of-a-kind squeal.) His commercial breakout albums Born to Mack and Life is…Too Short are packed with X-rated tales and his own brand of social commentary, like when he imagines getting blown by Nancy Reagan on 1988’s “CussWords.” His music got more textured at the tail end of the ’80s, with deeper bass and brooding synths forming the early sketches of mobb music, the funk-influenced sound that took over Northern California in the 1990s.",Rap,8.3
742,"The Tokyo guitarist and pianist channels jazz, fusion, and Japanese environmental music as he deepens the emotional resonance of his music while maintaining its soothing atmosphere. Leo Takami finds joy in simple melodies played in a straightforward manner. Though his compositions often lead somewhere unexpected, the jazz guitarist and pianist keeps his tunes as rounded and safe as kindergarten toys. Like Joe Hisaishi, the Studio Ghibli composer who is one of his clearest predecessors, Takami has forged an aesthetic that’s clear and chipper when it’s happy, curious and grounded when it’s not. His willingness to plainly state his emotional intentions without pandering or infantilizing is refreshing, as if he’s giving the listener permission to explore the complexities of feelings that once seemed easy to understand: You have no idea how interesting happiness can be. This quality made 2020’s Felis Catus and Silence a charming testimony of good cheer, and on Next Door, he deepens the emotional resonance of his music without setting it on edge.The mood on Next Door is blue, but Takami’s indefatigable optimism makes it more of an airy azure than the deep cobalt of, say, Miles Davis. Like Pat Metheny, his guitar lines have a plainspoken eloquence and patience that makes the music feel airy and open, even at its most contemplative. He chooses his notes carefully, more concerned with sustaining or expanding emotional tone than musical possibilities. On the lengthy lead he plots through “Winter Day,” he plays like he’s reading out loud from Dickens—he’s steady, precise, letting the notes themselves convey the meaning rather than the way he’s voicing them. He shakes loose a few needles from his guitar in “Road With Cypress and Star,” but he primarily saves the big, bursting runs for his piano and organ, both of which he tends to keep farther back in the mix, as if their relative feistiness might trouble the songs. If the textural clarity of the recording makes it feel like the music you’d hear in a department store stereo demonstration, that may be on purpose: Takami seems to want to fish his audience from the relentless flow of everyday life in order to experience the simple pleasure of listening.While Takami’s playing can be straightforward, it’s supported by subtly complex production that both supports and reframes the simplicity of the lead instruments. Like Felis Catus, the album draws equally from ECM jazz, classical minimalism, and Japanese environmental music without sounding much like any of them. Behind the opalescent drops and desert blues of “Beyond” are pulses that spread like moss in a deep forest. In “Family Tree,” a loop of faded found sound crackles behind a guitar swelling with regret. The interplay and the distance in fidelity between the elements makes the song’s sense of time feel three-dimensional, as if we’re hearing the present considering and being shaped by the past. Takami plays every instrument on the record, and he produced it himself; absent a band, these production touches are a form of interplay, and at times you can hear his leads responding to and being reshaped by the gentle urgings of their accompaniment.In the proper opener and standout “As If Listening,” Takami’s guitar greets you with a smile, but it emerges in the wake of the Erik Satie-like piano intro “Letter.” The sadness of that brief track lingers throughout “As If Listening,” sighing in the strings and implicit in the distant shuffle of shaker and pulse of marimba. Takami draws the guitar toward the background, its bliss eventually turning into a contemplative trance. When the song stops to catch its breath in the final moments, its momentum follows the gaze of the strings skyward. The slow twinkle of piano and hum of electronics make it feel like looking up at the sky in awe. Over and over again on Next Door, Leo Takami recontextualizes the familiar, returning us to truths whose universality made them cliches in the first place. The stars don’t shine any brighter here; you’re just seeing them through clearer air.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

743,"The Hessle Audio cofounder’s exuberant new album is stuffed with high BPMs, ribcage-vibrating basslines, and richly hued synths. Club music this banging is rarely so nuanced. A minute or so into the opening song on UK electronic musician Pangaea’s Changing Channels, something strange happens. Over a rubbery, insistent bassline and crisply swinging drums, an unidentified vocalist is spitting out a string of unintelligible syllables when a hissing refrain seems to materialize in the air, like a message left by an agitated ghost in a fogged-up mirror: “Hessle! Hessle!”That might not be so odd—after all, Pangaea’s latest album appears on Hessle Audio, the label he co-founded in 2007 with Ben UFO and Pearson Sound. But the phrase’s sudden appearance is also unlikely enough to make you doubt your own ears. For one thing, Hessle Audio has never been one to toot its own horn. Though it’s one of the UK’s most respected club labels—beloved for its unflagging dedication to both crowd-moving rhythms and innovative, brain-bending sounds—Hessle has always let the music speak for itself, with little self-promotion or social-media bluster. More to the point, the vocal in question is pure gobbledygook, a glossolalic rush cobbled together from stray phonemes and gasps of breath. Pangaea, aka London-based musician Kevin McAuley, has used the same Frankenstein-like technique to whip up monster anthems out of sampled lyrical detritus before. The Changing Channels opener might not really be saying “Hessle! Hessle!” but once you’ve heard it that way, you can’t unhear it. Maybe Pangaea hit upon those fortuitously soundalike syllables and decided to leave them in, an Easter egg for the label faithful.Pangaea does have a deep mischievous streak, after all. Though he got his start making shadowy dubstep derivatives indebted to the dark, silky garage of acts like Horsepower Productions, it didn’t take him long to begin adding sneakily unsettling elements, like a mad professor ominously pontificating about the soullessness of gray matter or a choir chirpily invoking the end of the world. In recent years, he’s increasingly gone all in on big, lapel-grabbing heaters, and Changing Channels contains some of his biggest and brashest yet; it’s a high-BPM, full-throated defense of fun as the most important ingredient in dance music.The club scene has undergone massive changes since bouncing back after the pandemic doldrums of 2020-2021. Tempos have soared, and so have moods. Even in corners of the underground where more serious modes once reigned, an insouciant spirit has wormed its way in, yielding brighter colors and wigglier basslines. Two Shell might be considered the poster boys for that shift; they got their start making relatively restrained DJ tools on Livity Sound (a UK label whose leftfield mission and positioning loosely align with Hessle’s) before graduating to their more notorious, helium-fueled hijinks. Pangaea mines an adjacent vein of ’90s garage and 2-step, and he pursues a similarly playful approach with his serotonin-boosting vocal chops.",Electronic,8.3
744,"On his stripped-down second solo album, the Parquet Courts frontman finalizes a messy divorce with his adopted hometown, ruminating on vanished cityscapes and piercing memories. New York City courses through Parquet Courts’ discography. The quartet that tapped the streets’ pulse on 2021’s “Walking at a Downtown Pace” has long captured the full spectrum of life in the city, from heady exploration to sheer exhaustion. For a subset of listless transplants of a certain age—those who moved there long after the Meet Me in the Bathroom years—Parquet Courts were their house band. Now their frontman, A. Savage, finds the house in flames.Savage has said that Several Songs About Fire is an album about escape—“a burning building.” It’s shot through with impending departures and monumental changes. Given that the 37-year-old musician finally decamped to Europe after completing the record, it’s tempting to consider it his “Why I Left New York” essay. (“The cantos of my New York years/Are scribed in ink that disappears,” he purrs in “My My, My Dear.”) By turns ruminative and jocular, he grapples with reminders that nothing is permanent: condo conversions, changing seasons, dead friends. Yet while all this might suggest the brainy fury Savage built his name on, his new album plays less like an anxious lifeboat and more like a meditative breadcrumb trail from an old life to a new one, destination unknown.Savage’s last solo record, 2017’s Thawing Dawn, offered a ragged and occasionally twangy iteration of Parquet Courts’ ’70s rock fixations. Several Songs About Fire is more restrained; the acoustic songs and electric rave-ups alike are simple and sturdy, anchored by his guitar and vocals and tastefully augmented by saxophones, pianos, and a spare, no-frills rhythm section. The material came together in writing sessions in England with Modern Nature’s Jack Cooper and on tour with Cate Le Bon; Savage then recorded the album in 10 days with John Parish in Bristol. That sense of movement is inscribed in its swinging cadences and propulsive drums; the slightly off-kilter rendering of well-worn rock’n’roll tropes suits an album about looking back at home from far away.Savage’s New York might be a ghost town, population one: “Hollowed face stranger/Just who might you be?/In the mirror, something’s crying/With the same eyes as me,” he sings in the first song’s opening lines. In track after track, he mulls over memories of neighborhood characters and late-night hijinks, contemplating all the ways that the city can grind you down. The lone exception is “Riding Cobbles,” a lighthearted fantasy of European idyll. Several Songs About Fire plays out like a long, messy divorce from an adopted home.",Rock,7.4
745,"The zany, ’80s-inspired debut from the 24-year-old pop singer and TikTok star showcases a promising young artist in the age of internet virality. Hemlocke Springs explains her creative process as a haphazard exercise with only three steps: collapse into neurosis, keyboard smash on your preferred DAW, and spill your guts. It's a characteristically insular approach for a young bedroom pop songwriter, but Springs winds up with something more eccentric than her peers. Her music is kitschy and yearning, drawing from 1980s synth-pop and 2010s alt-pop alike, delivered with the anguish of a 19th-century woman being sent out to sea. The 24-year-old artist, born Isimeme “Naomi” Udu, found an audience after uploading her music to Soundcloud and later TikTok while she was completing a master’s degree at Dartmouth. On her debut EP Going…Going…Gone!, she fleshes out her sound, highlighting a promising young artist in the age of internet virality.Every song on Going…Going…Gone! can be imagined in a different scene of an ’80s rom-com. Springs captures that era’s endearing cheese with bright tones and singalong hooks, wearing her influences—Depeche Mode, Prince, and Tears For Fears—on her sleeve. At the same time, her music also hearkens back to the pixelated laptop experiments of an artist like Grimes. She presents herself as the unlucky heroine pining for love and then hating herself when she can’t find it, emphasizing her agony with vocal melodrama. She yelps, croons, and growls on tracks like “girlfriend” and “the train to nowhere,” blending the most theatrical moments of several decades of pop icons into the EP’s brief runtime.Springs’ lyrics make her sound like a cursed Victorian ghost, doomed to live in heartbreak for all of eternity: “I need your attention/In this frail dimension of a brain,” she pleads on “gimme all ur luv.” “enknee1” has verses posed as racing thoughts, synthesizing embarrassment, dejection, and naivety all at once: “But I have made a mistake, it’s such a shame, I don’t think you’re into my kind,” she sings as she grapples with feeling inherently incapable of love. Later, the song explodes into half-time fantasia that could fit right into SPELLING’s The Turning Wheel. The EP scratches that nostalgic itch for a time when everything feels bigger, scarier, and more complicated than it actually is, so you let it out because it’s the only way to feel better.The last three tracks of the EP were written in quick succession after Springs visited Los Angeles, and at times, that hastiness is evident. On “pos,” she is at her most mercurial, too preoccupied with self-destruction to realize she’s destroying a relationship. The skeletal, cowbell-embellished production struts forward; her voice goes from raspy to shrill, and then she trills her lips. It’s exciting to see her push her weirdness, but the lyrics can make you scratch your head: “We should take an Andrew Jackson with tact and check in the movies at two.” But messiness is part of the journey, and Going…Going…Gone! is zany enough to feel unique and relatable enough to make you want to scream along at the sky.",Pop,7.1
746,"The Rotterdam quartet makes sparse yet atmospheric post-punk that draws inspiration from all things dreamy and twee. Out and About, the fourth album from Rotterdam quartet Lewsberg, is a collection of hypnotic, talky post-punk that hinges entirely on atmosphere. It’s music for small rooms with weird lighting, old churches where you have to sit on a bench, graveyards where you are always standing under a tree. It is also poetic but in an extremely self-aware and twee kind of way, doing things like meditating on the difference between “dog” and “god” or describing a weirdly sexy interaction with a doctor.Out and About plays like a mumblecore flick. The characters walk around musing about the meaning of life, winking after every sentence. They are prone to cerebral concepts, bringing in geometric optics into the song “Angle of Reflection,” but they find a way to immediately make it sound chill. They bring in an organ; a lonely drumbeat, practically unchanging; a crisp bassline, soft and almost out of focus. All of it flickers like a candle in a nightclub bathroom where you’d maybe hide out to avoid someone. Vocalists Arie van Vliet and Shalita Dietrich turn the environment into something spectral, intimate. “So there’s nothing new and I’m easily bored,” sings Dietrich, before following it up with “All I have to know: Would you do it once more?” She’s being deliberately cryptic, a mood that permeates the whole of the record.As musicians, Lewsberg pulls from the best of everything twee, dreamy, and naive. Out and About is a little Stereolab in the Stunning Debut Album primordial era, when things were more lo-fi and guitar-oriented. It’s also a little VU, if Maureen Tucker got to sing more, or the Moldy Peaches in leather jackets. “An Ear to the Chest” has the album’s best guitar moment, a pristine break in the middle that is almost erotic, unbearably lovely. “Communion” is a song that is possibly about being friends with Jesus Christ: “Bless the lord! My soul/Watch his body from above,” sings van Vilet, the music growing scuzzier in the background.On Out and About, Lewsberg are self-possessed, in touch with their aesthetic. They write songs that are funny, sweet, and weird. The music is an ever so slight sharpening and varnishing of the band’s past work. More so than melodic or lyrical choices, Lewsberg now focus on the small universe of a song, how different textures can alter the full effect. The violin on “Going Places” is like a small mouse running through some grass. Standout track “A Different View” pirouettes around like a toy ballerina in her miniature box, delicately atmospheric. Lewsburg are masters at conjuring these moods, capturing idiosyncrasies and turning them into intricate pop.",Rock,7.3
747,"Sufjan’s masterful new album recalls his intimate singer-songwriter days. But it also draws on his entire catalog, his dazzling musicality, and his lifelong inquiries about love and devotion. Once when Sufjan Stevens was in college, he brought an injured crow to the biology lab to help save its life. “You are doing the universe a great favor,” a woman who ran an animal sanctuary told him once he called her to the scene. This is one of several stories Stevens tells in his 10-part essay included in the elaborate physical edition of his latest album, Javelin, all in service of exploring his ever-expanding definition of “love.” He writes in an inquisitive and self-aware tone, joking about how that experience with the crow provided “endless fodder” for his collegiate creative writing: “So much meaning, so little time,” he reflects. But if a young Sufjan once sought these encounters for their symbolic potential, the present-day writer of this essay, and of these songs, tells a more pressing story: even more meaning, even less time.Over and over again on Javelin, Stevens contemplates the end. Sometimes his language, along with the hushed longing of his voice and the romantic sweep of his largely acoustic instrumentation, points toward the demise of a very long relationship. “I will always love you/But I cannot look at you,” he explains, tracing the broken logic governing the loss. “It’s a terrible thought to have and hold,” he admits after wishing ill to someone he once held dear. “Will anybody ever love me?” he asks in the aftermath.Instantly, the songwriting feels as raw and direct as ever. And indeed, Javelin is Stevens’ first proper album in a long time that seems designed with no grand concept to unify the material or inspire theatrical adaptations; no autobiographical insight to make you reconsider everything you thought you knew about him; no jarring musical change-ups to remind you he is a proud member of the Beyhive. Running under 45 minutes, Javelin begins with a deliberate inhale and ends with a cover of a deep cut from Neil Young’s best-selling album—a track that Stevens manages to make sound even sweeter and more hopeful than the 1972 original.Like much of his defining work, Stevens wrote, recorded, and produced Javelin almost entirely alone, minus a few key appearances: some guitar from the National’s Bryce Dessner in the dazzling eight-minute “Shit Talk,” and frequent vocal accompaniment from a small choir that includes Megan Lui, Hannah Cohen, Pauline Delassus, Nedelle Torrisi, and the activist and writer adrienne maree brown. It’s got at least one song that instantly joins the ranks of his very best (“Will Anybody Ever Love Me?”) and plenty that draw direct lines to previous high-water marks, both thematically and musically. Centering the devotional melodies and heart-tugging intimacy that characterized his early masterpieces, it’s the type of record, two decades into an artist’s career, that tends to be called a “return-to-form,” suggesting an embrace of his strengths and a diminished instinct to surprise or provoke.",Folk,8.6
748,"Clementine Creevy sifts through the muck on her new album, picking up everything from radio-friendly electro-pop to fuzzed-out garage rock. On Cherry Glazerr’s first new album in four years, I Don’t Want You Anymore, Clementine Creevy pushes herself to extremes. As a lyricist, she explores devotion and surrender, apathy and dependency. As a musician, and self-producing alongside Yves Rothman, she swerves from radio-friendly electro-pop to fuzzed-out garage rock, her vocals delivered in conspiratorial speak-sing or guttural howls. If it scans as an artist throwing everything at the wall, the triumph is that Creevy sounds like she’s in the process of sorting through it.Cherry Glazerr’s previous albums, 2014’s Haxel Princess and 2017’s Apocalipstick, were rooted in garage rock and noise-pop, but 2019’s Stuffed & Ready went off like a cynical, adrenalized bomb. In place of those explosive moments, I Don’t Want You Anymore paws at ambiguity. The feelings are raw, and Creevy resists major-chord resolutions. Alongside sparse basslines played by Rothman and Sami Perez, Creevy captures the emotional murkiness of a series of devastating but life-affirming relationships through her chilled minor-key guitar and a playful snarl that recalls PJ Harvey. She has cited Evanescence as an influence—a clear reference point for the album’s moments of unbridled drama. But this isn’t a mall-goth reinvention; in sound and subject matter, Cherry Glazerr resists being pinned to any one aesthetic or sound.Two songs early in the album show just how much Creevy is willing to expand. “Touched You With My Chaos” is a melancholy anthem with harsh, overdriven guitars, shrieking trumpet, and a maudlin string section in the final minute. Creevy wrote it after watching Gregg Araki’s harrowing 2004 film Mysterious Skin, seeking to mimic its themes of desperation, which she does in a screamy, bratty chorus: “I said that I loved you,” she howls. “I never wanted love.” In the relentless “Soft Like a Flower,” Creevy bares it all over garage rock deep-fried in emo. The song ends in a maniacal laugh that could easily be mistaken for a cry: an actorly gesture that suggests Creevy is fiercely devoted to her role.The maniacal laugh-cry is also a sign Creevy’s having fun again. It recalls the offbeat ridiculousness of early Cherry Glazerr gems like “Grilled Cheese,” a surprisingly sultry ode to comfort food. I Don’t Want You Anymore falls flat when Creevy opts for bubbly, optimistic indie pop like “Wild Times,” which doesn’t display the distinct artistic personality she has developed over the past decade. But the rest of the album’s back half soars, particularly “Sugar,” a slow-build rocker in which Creevy’s vocals take on an ominous lullaby lilt: “You make me wanna push my luck/Break my heart/I don’t care,” she sings. By the end, Creevy once again erupts in delirious laughter, but this time, there’s no mistaking it for tears—the only logical response is to start laughing along with her.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

749,"The Chicago band motors through big emotions with clear-eyed sincerity, bubblegum hooks, and mellow arrangements that feel like a warm embrace. Slow Pulp know how to ground extreme emotion. Their shoegaze-tinged country rock can transform euphoria into a mellow CBD gummy high, anchor combustible bursts of rage, and buoy depression. Their self-produced 2020 debut, Moveys, was a knot of self-deprecating lyricism beneath a weighted blanket of droopy guitars and shiny glimmers of violin and piano. When they weren’t questioning the point of it all, it seemed the Chicago-based quartet—Emily Massey, Henry Stoehr, Alex Leeds, and Teddy Mathews—was just trying to get by. On their follow-up, Yard, Slow Pulp still cozy up to the introspective, sometimes dark, side of life. But instead of succumbing to the depressive haze, they find the momentum to move forward.With Yard, Slow Pulp solidify their laid-back sound. It’s a fine balance of ’90s alt-rock grit and melody, with the introspective, detail-driven storytelling of folk music. As on Moveys, doubt still creeps in. But this time, the sensation gets its own bubblegum pop song: “Take me out/Put me down,” Massey sings on the chorus of “Doubt,” turning the title into a stuttering, one-word refrain. On the combustible “Cramps,” Massey longs to inhabit someone else’s personality. The most captivating moment is when her vocals begin to split apart, like the force of her desire could consume her whole.On the album’s anchor “Yard,” Massey swings at a punching bag dressed in her own image: “I’m a bitch/I’ve been a bitch,” she sighs. It’s Yard’s sparsest and most compelling track, as Massey takes us on a time-traveling tour of her past and present mistakes. “The neighbors hear my singing/I don’t care cause I’m much too baked/Their dogs are barking at the water/I yelled they messed up my take,” she sings over a sparse piano melody. These lighthearted reflections on the creative process eventually spiral into thorny self-realizations as she comes to terms with saying goodbye to her childhood home: “Didn’t know that I cared that much,” she says upon noticing the “for sale” sign. Often, Slow Pulp pair these diaristic reflections with lush arrangements, but here the thought is laid bare.Thematically, Yard is concerned with the way people can drift into each other’s lives, for better or worse; sometimes they’re a one-hit wonder arriving unannounced, and sometimes they’re the classic we turn to at our lowest. “What if I tell you that/You keep playing in my head/Cause you’re a summer hit,” Massey muses on the candy-sweet love song “Slugs.” The softness of the arrangements—a patchwork of fuzzy power chords, perky piano keys, and easygoing drums—is like a breeze through the car window in mid-June. “Carina Phone 1000” describes the serendipitous magic of a long-lost friend who reaches out at just the right moment. Slow Pulp excel in this pared-back country-folk mode, with a sigh of pedal steel or a hug of harmonica, and vocals that feel like a secure embrace rather than a distant cry. When the pressure of life threatens to pop you like a tire, their clear-eyed sincerity keeps on rolling.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

750,"The Los Angeles rapper’s second album this year confronts the uncertainties of life with characteristically reflective rhymes and a steely new determination. Maxo’s music, especially as of late, has felt like those coming-of-age movie scenes where the frenzied young protagonist meets someone they aspire to become—picture Benny “the Jet” Rodriguez and Babe Ruth—and realizes that today’s stressors eventually build tomorrow’s character. The Los Angeles veteran’s output has long thrived through reflection, inhabiting soupy, hypnagogic production like a confessional booth of his own creation. For the cover art of his most recent record, February’s Even God Has a Sense of Humor, he took the uncomfortable measure of lifecasting: a process like getting a portrait painted, except that you’re slathered in guck, you can’t see anything, and the “painting” is a large, topographically accurate bust of your body. The songs on that project were disarmingly personal and deliberate, larger-than-life without being invincible. It’s hard to run when you’re stuck under a coat of alginate.Where much of Maxo’s output has functioned like a living diary, Debbie’s Son sounds less like he’s taking inventory of his baggage than trying to cut through it with a knife. The record’s ethos is encapsulated in the opening verse to “Another. LAnd,” where contemplation is supercharged by acknowledgements of his right to self-interrogation. “I question the ways inside my being/I’m workin for change but present time speak,” he admits, before turning away from the mirror to lob an abrupt question: “Who is you to judge?” As much as his self-image has hardened, it remains too nuanced to feel impenetrable. On the track directly following “Another .LAnd,” he turns his back on the scornful “you,” and returns to the mirror. “Reminding myself I’m strong as what I’m faced with,” he says, in a sing-songy voice that borders on teasing. “But it’s hurting, aint it?” As much as you can hear the pain, there’s also a sense of triumph.Debbie’s Son features an eclectic cast of producers, including lastnamedavid, Alexander Spit, The Alchemist, and Beat Butcha. They provide a compelling range of cinematic backdrops, against which an on-edge Maxo hurls mantras like graffiti on government buildings. His tone is careful yet unapologetic, self-confident without being reckless. While some tracks thump along to rhythms as precise as assembly lines (“PlayDis!”, “Another. LAnd,” “What Are You Looking For?”), others bask in his more characteristic jazz arrangements, reverb-heavy vocals cutting through haze like the sort of old-and-wise deity that Morgan Freeman could portray on camera. On the Ahwlee-produced “Boomerang,” a love song to “the old me,” lush guitar arpeggiations stumble into one another in a trance. There’s unresolved sentimentality to the instruments’ circular haze, complementing Maxo’s lyrical back-and-forth between past and future.The record leans into the foundational elements of Maxo’s music—verses that meander more than they attack; roomy, coffee-shop-band auras; autobiographical honesty—but occasionally departs to give old tricks new vigor. Compared to the murky vocal mixes on his earliest releases, he’s coming through noticeably clearer now. And he’s more willing to be a prophet in places where he once was content being a proselyte. “No wonder why I been chasin’ unknown,” he echoes, with the knowing whisper-speak of a Black grandparent telling a story, over the jazzy title track. As he repeats these words, an upright bass stumbles along a riff that’s just as asymptotic. As meditative as his work has always been while foregrounding a new sense of fortitude, Debbie’s Son shines in the many moments when Maxo and the music are convincingly one.",Rap,7.4
751,"The prolific Kenyan-born, Berlin-based electronic musician departs from his typical use of field recordings, but environmental sound still makes its mark on his immersive, long-form explorations. KMRU is not the call sign of a radio station, though it could very well be. The calendar of this imaginary broadcaster would vary in format and genre. Shows would change frequently: evolve, morph, disappear. To tune into KMRU would mean being surprised. Some shows would feature lengthy abstract drones, others would venture into the territory of techno, or focus on cerebral minimalism, and some would feature guest instrumentalists and vocalists. Yet for all that unpredictability, to pull up KMRU on your radio dial would invariably entail hearing field recordings—sometimes in their raw, undigested form, but far more frequently augmented by all manner of digital techniques and aesthetic practices.But of course KMRU isn’t a radio station; KMRU is a lone individual (if an impressively prolific one). That taut quartet of letters is a compression of his family name: Kamaru. First name Joseph, born in Nairobi, Kenya, and relocated to Berlin, Germany, he has over the past few years become a widely referenced figure in contemporary electronic music, excelling in all the sounds mentioned above. Throughout it all, field recordings have been central to his work—quarried for their textural qualities, or sliced and diced into corrosive soundscapes, or laid bare to serve as vicarious sonic travel aids.But on his new album Dissolution Grip, the first release from his own label, OFNOT, he manages to remove field recordings entirely while nonetheless amplifying their presence. (If KMRU actually were a radio station, this radical shift would suggest a change in management had occurred.) During his studies with artist and composer Jasmine Guffond at Berlin’s Universität der Künste, KMRU developed a technique of rendering field recordings into visual representation, then interpreting those images as graphic scores. Yet despite the absence of bird song, traffic din, and quotidian clatter, KMRU’s emphasis on long-form immersive explorations persists.The album fades in quickly. Within a split second, the opening track, “Till Hurricane Bisect,” rises to an unsteady hum, like a drum kit’s cymbal resonating to nearby traffic. Halfway through its 15 minutes, you might mistake the piece for the audio of a wartime documentary, due to a hovering, whirring noise, like a helicopter overhead, sweeping the territory. The most chilling sounds, though, are close-ups: little knocks that will have you pausing the music to check if someone is trying to get your attention. His under-recognized gift for melody is evident when a slow monosynth line emerges—a green shoot, a hopeful moment—before it is suffocated by clanging.On the title track, tonal moments toward the end sound very much like KMRU is singing along, intoning with the synthesized drones. It may simply be a trick of the overtones, or perhaps a deep man-machine empathy. Elsewhere amid its 13 and a half minutes are toothed zithers and euphonious timbres, palpitating murmurs and demanding noises—in other words, many of the emotional cues one might expect from KMRU, just rendered through different means. To listen is to wonder what is being represented, or reconstituted: from sound to image and back to sound again. Here and on the closing track, the 12-minute “Along a Wall,” the music begins to resemble a Sarah Davachi organ piece or a Harry Bertoia sound sculpture—or, more than anything, old-school space music. Having moved to Germany from Kenya, KMRU has tapped into the country’s storied vein of kosmische: rather than field recordings of our planet, an offworld sound born of technology.",Electronic,7.2
752,"The Miami producer and vocalist’s expertly curated, shamelessly horny new mixtape revels in reggaeton’s queer and femme club underground. Arepa Mixtape, the new record from MJ Nebreda, seems designed to leave blue denim stains on basement walls. The Peruvian-Venezuelan producer and singer’s newest release is a clubby reggaeton thrill, one that revels in the genre’s sauciness, sex, and singular sense of humor while providing curative carnal nourishment. The troublemakers in these songs know it’s okay not to be liked. They come quick and make money fast. They post thirst traps for themselves and no one else. Here, being messy and sexy is a way of life—and a perreo sucio is the only appropriate soundtrack.The Miami artist has only been making music for three years, but Arepa already positions her as a deft newcomer. Nebreda is credited as a writer and producer on every song on the tape. She sparkles as a curator, too, perhaps a result of her former role in A&R. She twists together sticky dembow riddims, chonga aesthetics of excess, and raptor house’s mind-numbing drum loops. On top of all the heat is her insolent voice, which frequently feels like it’s about to break into an orgasmic moan. “Muy Fina” is a full-on playground taunt in which Nebreda and guest Gini Santana assume the role of “pretty bitches” demanding that trifling men cough up (“Better to transfer that money to my PayPal,” they spit in Spanish). In these moments, Nebreda channels reggaeton icons like Glory and Jenny La Sexy Voz—women whose sex appeal was foundational to the genre’s commercial triumph, even if they were almost never credited for their indelible, generation-defining hooks.Nebreda’s irreverent one-liners often feel liberatory, but never rely on strained or corny empowerment tropes. “Calor,” featuring fellow Miami producer Nick León, is a linguistic romp, the verb tenses and grammatical gender limits of Spanish stretched into an elegantly bratty rhyme: “A mi me sobra lo que a ti rest’/Así que vengase pa’ca/Que te lo compartex.” And then there’s the unabashed horniness. On the title track, she uses the yonic form of the arepa, a Venezuelan national dish, to represent pussy. She and guest Calacote slur the hook on “Agua Sin Gas” so that it ends up sounding like “I’m gonna fuck” in Dominican slang. Later, on “Teta” (Spanish for “boob”), Nebreda threatens to lick your belly button.Arepa doubles as a showcase of the producers and vocalists defying fixed interpretations of reggaeton as misogynistic and homophobic. This genre has always had ample room for the queer and the femme; all you had to do was hand over the mic. Across Arepa, the pronouns are fluid and so are the genders of whoever you’re fucking. There are appearances from fresh faces like trans and non-binary Puerto Rican artist Ana Macho and the Toronto-based Dominican experimentalist Móry, as well as more established names, like neoperreo matriarch Ms Nina. With a crew of equally ungovernable baddies in tow, Arepa’s directive to misbehave and shake your ass is irresistible.Arepa illustrates that the most promising artists in reggaeton aren’t signed to Columbia or Universal; they’re building dembow riddims in their bedrooms and raving on the weekends. Only a handful of tracks here sound rough around the edges. “Teta” drills through raptor house bedrock, but the Mussa Medusa verses land in a lo-fi haze, resembling demos more than final products. This is technically a mixtape, so that unpolished finish adds its own charm. Reggaeton is often a pleasure practice, and Nebreda seems less interested in perfection than immersive ecstasy. In the fantasia of Arepa, everyone is a ruthless man-eater or a drop-dead vixen who deserves to feel good.",Pop,7.8
753,"Multi-instrumentalists Nathan Bowles, Jaime Fennelly, and Joe Westerlund combine forces on textured, stormy folk compositions that encourage deeper listening. Shone a Rainbow Light On, by the new instrumental folk trio Setting, evokes the dark, infinite expanse of the night sky with its shimmering stars. The joint project of multi-instrumentalists Nathan Bowles, Jaime Fennelly, and Joe Westerlund, the album draws upon free improvisation, Americana, and minimalist music to recreate the textures of the murky unknown. The three artists are experts in composing intricate soundscapes out of a few elements: Fennelly crafts celestial drone music as Mind Over Mirrors, Bowles has played for years in the trailblazing psychedelic noise band Pelt, and Westerlund has drummed in the folk-rock group Megafaun and DeYarmond Edison, the early band of Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon. Together, they show that Americana music doesn’t have to be sun-dappled and bright, it can be mysterious and unwieldy, too.Formed during the pandemic in 2021, Setting began as a series of regular improvisation sessions in Westerlund’s backyard in Durham, North Carolina. Bowles and Westerlund had already been playing together occasionally as a percussion duo, and Fennelly had given them the motivation to all gather while passing through Durham from the North Carolina coast. During the trio’s early sessions they’d jam outside at a distance, letting the wide-open spirit of the outdoors seep into their work. The trio’s songs move in cycles, like a storm blowing through a field, and their instruments often flutter like birds or buzz like insects.Though Settings’ music sprawls, it feels minimalistic in practice, exploring just a couple of chords like Philip Glass and encouraging deeper listening like Pauline Oliveros. The trio often begins with a few long notes, gradually adding rhythms and other timbres to the mix; their motions are subtle, their music deepening with each added layer. Opener “We Center” feels like a delicate meditation at the start, beginning with soft, rustling noises. Pulsating rhythms enter at a distance and come into view with each repetition. Hearing the song is like looking out at a barren wilderness and noticing, upon closer examination, that it’s teeming with life.Shone a Rainbow Light On’s twists and turns give each track bottomless dimension. The tense, fast-paced, “Zoetropics” starts with forlorn tones and bustling rhythms; bristling, plucked melodies join the fray only to pull away as quickly as they enter. “A Sun Harp” opens with a series of free improvisations on piano, synths, and percussion, layering patterns that don’t seem to mesh; it grows into an uproar, each instrument crescendoing until it bursts aflame. Their music is at its most haywire, yet by the end, it still returns to a place of calm. The solemn closer “Fog Glossaries” is the most unexpected. The rumbling song sighs out chords, and a chime gloomily marks the passage of time. It’s the darkest track on the album and where the trio’s details feel their most vivid—nature’s thorniness displayed in full beauty.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

754,"The duo of Elucid and billy woods delivers a moody, unsettling, sharply observed album balancing moments of self-reflection with vivid snapshots of societal dysfunction. Backwoodz Studioz engineer Willie Green has said he wants people to have a “physical reaction” when they listen to one of the label’s records. Last year, Green and Armand Hammer’s Elucid assembled a crew of players for a session at the Greenhouse in Gowanus, Brooklyn, with the idea of jamming to beats and following where it led them. It was the first time that Shabaka Hutchings (flute), Adi Myerson (bass), Max Heath (synthesizer), and Hisham Bharoocha (drums) had met; Elucid says that watching their early fumblings give way to grooves with spiritual heft was foundational to the creation of We Buy Diabetic Test Strips, Armand Hammer’s sixth album. By Green’s own rubric, the album is a success—it can feel like being tugged by dozens of different hands yet still being pulled forward.That organic jam session—in which relative strangers found the funk in their very first meeting—mirrors the way that Elucid and his partner in the duo Armand Hammer, Backwoodz founder billy woods, have collected a slew of eccentric personalities and given them a common purpose. woods has called Elucid Backwoodz’s “secret weapon” as an A&R, and he might be right; it’s hard to imagine anyone else making a record like this sound coherent. woods and producer Kenny Segal’s 2023 album Maps was a vividly evocative tour diary populated by colorful characters, but when the two rappers work together, Elucid lifts woods into the ether.Armand Hammer’s music can be indecipherable by design, with profundity often camouflaged by abstraction. On We Buy Diabetic Test Strips, they contemplate their inevitable end, often graphically (“Men pregnant with death, frightened at the quickening/It totters on unsteady legs, boy you invited to the christening,” woods raps), yet manage to stave off hopelessness. The two continue to process life’s indignities with absurdist humor and a caustic wit, telling disjointed stories through intersecting narratives that only come into focus when viewed as a whole.The most unconventional of their guest stars is, of course, JPEGMAFIA, the Baltimore rapper and producer known for his abrasive productions and persona. JPEGMAFIA’s work accounts for a little more than a quarter of the album, but his glitchy, warped aesthetic bookends the tracklist and helps define the mood. He opens the album with a hypnotic synth loop and a vocal sample stuttering in the background; there’s no bass, just a single snare crack punctuated by a landline dial tone. He’ll bury a gentle melody beneath cacophonous yelling, then switch the beat mid-song to weave video game SFX into boom-bap drums and drench the whole thing in reverb (“When It Doesn’t Start With a Kiss”). Even in the slow and quiet moments, chaos lurks in his productions—an interrupted moan, a hair-raising scrape—and it’s fascinating to watch woods and Elucid adapt their flows to meet the challenge.How billy woods’ Backwoodz Studioz Became New York’s Best Underground Rap LabelWe Buy Diabetic Test Strips is as much a Backwoodz Studioz showcase as an Armand Hammer album. Over the last decade or so, Backwoodz has steadily established itself as a paragon of the New York underground, an example of how a community and a business can feed off one another. You can see the equity as plain as their publishing splits. Backwoodz’s roster is all over the LP—guest verses from Curly Castro and Moor Mother; production from Steel Tipped Dove, Kenny Segal, Jeff Markey, and Willie Green—resulting in an album that gels despite its idiosyncrasies. It’s fitting that there’s an El-P production credit, as his now-defunct indie label Definitive Jux was to the New York underground in the ’00s as Backwoodz is today: a loose collective of left-of-center artists that coalesced around creative freedom rather than a particular sound, emphasizing transparency in business, if not always their art.",Rap,8.1
755,"Featuring players from Spiritualized and the Necks, the hushed third album from Jack Cooper’s chamber-improv ensemble slots into a lineage of exploratory groups fusing folk, psych, and post-rock. There is music that feels like it was born out of a white-hot spark of inspiration, and there is music that feels like it has come together gradually, like accrued wisdom; the music that Jack Cooper records as Modern Nature falls into the latter category. Across three studio albums, Cooper—a musician originally from the English seaside town of Blackpool, now located somewhere in the countryside of Cambridgeshire —has invented and refined a quietly introspective, semi-improvised acoustic style that nonetheless feels richly sensual and radical in its approach.Cooper has lived a few musical lives already. He fronted the scuzzy 2010s punk group Mazes and made sunny psych as part of Ultimate Painting before launching Modern Nature. I’m willing to bet the name of this group comes from the 1991 book by Derek Jarman, which documented the artist and filmmaker’s building of a garden amid the arid shingle of Dungeness on England’s south coast, shortly after Jarman had been diagnosed with HIV. That sounds potentially bleak, but Modern Nature was about finding new ways to live, and Cooper’s music feels born from a similar impulse: an attempt to shed the baggage of the past and create something honest and meaningful by embracing nature’s cycles of renewal and rebirth.Like Modern Nature’s 2022 album Island of Noise, No Fixed Point in Space draws on the language of free improv, but this is a subtler and more muted record than its predecessor, and somewhat stranger in the bargain. Recorded live to tape with Cooper joined by a loose consort of players that includes Spiritualized’s Alex Ward, the Necks’ Chris Abrahams, the veteran experimental vocalist Julie Tippetts, and members of the London avant-garde group Apartment House, its gently exploratory chamber music occupies a liminal space somewhere between composition and spontaneity; its loosely notated songs are given space to wander and drift.The title of No Fixed Point In Space comes from Albert Einstein by way of the dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham. Cunningham used the term as a way of conceptualizing a group performance without a central focal point, and Cooper borrows it as a guiding precept here, nominating no one leader and empowering his chosen players to find their own route. Take a track like “Murmuration.” Its constituent parts—plucked electric guitar, hushed woodwind, tapped cymbal, and Cooper’s lightly dazed voice—intermingle yet never tethered to one another. The song’s title takes its name from the flocks of starlings that weave and turn as one, a natural phenomenon in line with this album’s affinity with the patterns of nature, but also a useful metaphor for the way the album’s music itself is assembled: each musician a free agent, but all acting together in a state of harmony.",Rock,7.6
756,"The Scottish power-pop band keeps things light on an album distinguished by subtle touches and twilight grooves. Nothing Lasts Forever may seem like a peculiar choice of an album title for Teenage Fanclub, a group devoted to preserving the sound and sensibility of the guitar-pop explosion of the mid-1960s. Six-string traditionalists even when they drowned their melodies in fuzz, the band assimilated the innovations of the Byrds and the Beach Boys, becoming one of the most enduring practitioners of power-pop—a catch-all term encompassing any rock group bearing an undisguised debt to the bright, punchy sounds of the Beatles and their disciples. Their steadfast adherence to the jangle, chime, and sigh of harmonies and hooks suggested Teenage Fanclub was suspended in time, untouched by either shifting fashions or the weathering of age.Once wielding guitars gnarly enough to make them peers of Nirvana, Teenage Fanclub abandoned any pretext of sounding contemporary at the moment Britpop popularized the very aesthetic they championed. At the height of Cool Britannia, they turned to the American West Coast—their 1997 album Songs from Northern Britain suggested the UK was located somewhere in Laurel Canyon—adding softer vocal harmonies and steady strums, elements that became foundational to Teenage Fanclub. These qualities give the band a gentle touch that feels welcoming even when they’re singing about disquieting subjects, as they often did on 2021’s Endless Arcade, where they learned how to proceed without founding bassist Gerard Love and as their chief singer/songwriter Norman Blake came to terms with the end of his marriage.Despite its title, Nothing Lasts Forever feels settled, as if the group has accepted the transient nature of the seasons. They introduce this theme immediately with “Foreign Land,” a tranquil tune that opens with Blake declaring “It’s time to move along/And leave the past behind me.” The forward motion echoes throughout Nothing Lasts Forever. In “I Left a Light On,” Blake clings to the notion that there’s a way to emerge from the darkness, a wish that’s later fulfilled in the amiable ramble “Back to the Light.” Raymond McGinley, Blake’s lieutenant songwriter in Teenage Fanclub, is on the same wavelength, declaring that he’s “Tired of Being Alone” and surmising that “everyone feels better lovered.”The warmth emanating from the lyrics flows throughout Nothing Lasts Forever. Teenage Fanclub never quickens the pace or belabors the melodies, choosing to luxuriate in their twilight grooves. The contained chemistry isn’t insular or monochromatic: They balance the tempered Beach Boys bounce of “Self-Sedation” with the extended exhale of the shimmering closer “I Will Love You.” Such subtle shifts in tone underscore how Teenage Fanclub now specializes in nuance, eschewing production frills in favor of unadorned, subtle colorings. Vocal harmonies glide in and out of the mix, keyboardist Euros Childs adds empathetic texture, and the steady sway of strummed guitars anchor the band more than the backbeat. Instead of driving down on the crystalline hook that powers “See the Light,” the band lets it drift and linger; it sounds as if they’re marveling at its contours. The songcraft matters but so does the interplay, and that’s why Teenage Fanclub’s power-pop still resonates. They’re not interested in crafting the platonic ideal of an AM pop song—they’re using pop music as a lifeline.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

757,"The Water From Your Eyes vocalist’s new solo EP is a collection of charming, heartfelt bedroom pop songs that deserve to be more fully realized. Rachel Brown keeps their foot on the gas pedal. In addition to making experimental art-rock as one half of Water From Your Eyes, the 26-year-old singer-songwriter has uploaded over 80 solo releases to Bandcamp as Thanks for Coming, even releasing this year’s self-deprecatingly titled highlight compilation You Haven’t Missed Much to help newcomers navigate their sprawling catalog. For them, churning out tracks keeps their creative muscles active and frees them from overthinking. But their latest EP, What Is My Capacity to Love?, shows how speed can be a disservice too, with candid self-reflections on romance that can feel undercooked.Brown’s Water From Your Eyes bandmate Nate Amos mastered every song on the EP, but What Is My Capacity to Love? is a far cry from the cacophony of their band. The lone similarity is a discordant guitar line running through “Melted,” which could be one of the rubbery riffs on Everyone’s Crushed. Instead, Brown prefers barren, lo-fi bedroom pop where errors only add to the music’s charm. On “Try Again,” they tumble off beat while rushing through the central refrain, as if to mirror being mentally distracted by crush. “Depends” is thrust forward by emotional, almost lackadaisical strumming that recalls the tender twee of the Softies; Brown confesses to the dangers of loving someone too hard, the spare instrumentation magnifying their vulnerable delivery.Brown’s mesmerizing, almost detached singing anchors the music of both Water From Your Eyes and Thanks for Coming. It can be deceptively dynamic, and on What Is My Capacity to Love?, they try on different vocal styles: fluttering falsettos, glossy whispers, irritated talk-speak. While it’s thrilling to hear Brown play around with their delivery, sometimes their words feel cheap. As they reminisce on a past relationship in the EP opener, they lean on eyeroll-worthy punchlines: “I wish I’d captured you like a photograph/I wish I had/But still life is still life.” Their petulant enunciations on “Postcard”—“I broke my heart then I blamed him, framed him for the crime”—further underscore the juvenile writing.What Is My Capacity to Love? is like a heartfelt mixtape that slipped through the metal divider of your high school locker. Maybe it’s because of the voice note that closes the album, which is spoken directly into the microphone like some last-ditch confessional: “I can’t see anything that I don’t like about you—but you will,” Brown says at the end of “Spotless Mind,” resignation weighing down their voice. “You know you will think of things, and I’ll get bored with you and feel trapped because that’s what happens with me. Okay? Okay.” The pent-up feelings emanating from that final passage are intense—and it’s this intensity that helps elevate “Spotless Mind” from more humdrum bedroom pop. If only What Is My Capacity to Love? could maintain that heart-piercing tension throughout. The homespun quality of Thanks for Coming songs draws them close to the chest, but the music deserves a more striking, realized form too.",Rock,6.0
758,"Daniel Lopatin returns with a nostalgic jam session full of proggy synth passages and ’90s alt-rock touches. It leaves a lot to admire but a little less to think about. Daniel Lopatin is hung up on the past: how it shapes us, and how we shape it in turn; how the songs on the radio of your parents’ minivan can frame your perception of the world, and how your recollections of the same songs can morph and distort over time. As Oneohtrix Point Never, Lopatin has reveled in this slippery process: “My impulse to create often comes from some kind of confusion I have around memories of music,” he recently told The Line of Best Fit, examining how the music he loved (and hated) as a child still informs his present-day self. “I always go to the endless wellspring of my false memories.”But Lopatin’s attention has gradually shifted away from theories of nostalgia and taste toward what to make of his own unlikely career. In his evolution from an avant-garde sculptor of smartphone psychedelia into a full-fledged film composer, pop producer, and Superbowl musical director, he has sometimes seemed unsure of what to do with the project that first put him on the map over a decade ago. There have been awkward forays into vocal pop, premature career retrospectives, and an ever-accumulating pile of instruments and sounds threatening to crush his music under its weight. While Rifts and R Plus Seven painstakingly constructed worlds where each timbre vividly reinforced Lopatin’s haunting vision of a life spent online, his overstuffed recent albums are likelier to evoke bleary nights of passive doomscrolling.Oneohtrix Point Never’s latest album, Again, is his least conceptual project yet. Though Lopatin has described the record as an interrogation of his younger self and the roads he might have taken, you wouldn’t necessarily pick up on that from listening to it. He wheels out all his favorite tropes, stirring JUNO-60 arpeggios, choral pads, and MIDI instruments straight from the uncanny valley into a churning soup. The only real developments include a newfound interest in string-laden orchestration and an unexpected turn toward ’90s alt rock—if you’ve ever wondered what Lopatin’s impression of a Smashing Pumpkins ballad might sound like, you can rest easy now. These detours may hint at alternate OPN timelines, but more than anything, Again plays like Lopatin’s jam record: He’s laid out his tools, knows what he likes, and is content to noodle around the playground he’s built for himself. When he brings the requisite energy, it’s still a pleasure to witness him shred. But for all its surreal soundscapes, Again leaves surprisingly little to the imagination.",Experimental,6.9
759,"The UK singer’s earthy, sumptuous new album explores her ambivalent relationship to fame. It soars when it lets loose. Earlier this year, Jorja Smith showed up unannounced to a Birmingham club to perform her new song “Little Things” shoulder-to-shoulder with the crowd, radiating effortless joy in her Juicy Couture tracksuit and sunglasses. The song is a career highlight for Smith, who glides breezily over its early-2000s UK funky bounce. As you watch the rowdy clip of her singing it, you almost forget she is one of the UK’s biggest homegrown pop stars. On her unhurried, self-possessed second album, Falling or Flying, she shines in the moments where she exudes this same loose-limbed confidence.Smith’s 2018 debut Lost & Found was a collection of stylish, socially-conscious R&B and soul that showed off her silky voice, though its pristinely produced ballads could feel a little safe. She found an international audience through her work with Drake, who featured her on his 2017 mixtape More Life. But Smith, who releases all her music on her own independent label FAMM, has often shown reluctance to follow the expected path for a pop upstart, stripping down her sound further on her 2021 EP Be Right Back instead of attempting to repeat the success of her surprise garage hit with Preditah or dancefloor-heating collaboration with Burna Boy. Recently, she moved away from the music industry hub of London back to her childhood town of Walsall, living quietly in a farmhouse.In Walsall, she’s teamed up with local production duo Edith Nelson and Barbara Boko-Hyouyhat, collectively known as DameDame*, for Falling or Flying. The result is a sumptuous, earthy album that experiments more freely with genre than Smith’s music has before. The first half of the record propels from the springy alternative R&B of “She Feels” and the Afrobeats of “Feelings” to the pop punk of “GO GO GO.” The spaciousness of the production makes it all feel considered rather than overwhelming: Guitars lick at the edges of melodies, ghostly layered vocals soar in the middle distance, and basslines shudder. Smith’s voice is assured and grounded: She reaches far less frequently for belting high notes and runs than she did on Lost & Found, instead sitting back comfortably.Much of the record explores her ambivalent relationship to fame, though Smith keeps her cards close to her chest. “Ask me about me again,” Smith dares you at the outset, over strident production buoyed by the ring of bicycle bells and clattering percussion. Her cagey lyrics dance around the pressure of being a public figure, imploring you to read her, while refusing to be easy to read. Elsewhere, on the world-weary ballad “Too Many Times,” she contemplates the people who only see her worth now that she's famous, plumbing the smoky depths of her lower register.",Pop,7.6
760,"The Kentucky songwriter surveys the past, present, and future of country music on a thoughtful new record with deep roots. Tyler Childers knows how the house of country music can be divided against itself. Since his 2011 debut, the Kentucky songwriter has roamed beyond the conventional divisions of the genre, flirting not just with Sturgill Simpson-esque heartland rock and old-time mountain music but synthesizers and even lo-fi beats. As an outspoken progressive who has found success outside the Nashville establishment, it’s tempting to see him as a break from the genre, rather than an artist working within a clear sense of tradition. But at the 2018 Americana Awards, where he accepted an award for Emerging Artist after the host mispronounced his last name, Childers took a hardline stance on his preferred genre: “Everybody always talks about the state of country music and puts down commercial country and says ‘Something’s gotta be done’ and ‘We need to be elevating artists that are doing more traditional country,’ But then we’re not calling those artists country.”His latest record, Rustin’ in the Rain, is impossible to mistake for anything but country music. From the jaunty opening guitar lick, its songs take the dirty stains on his shirt and the scraggly edges of his sound as a badge of honor: “Blame it on my jeans/Caked in tenant farmin’,” he quips on the title track. Childers has always approached music as hard work, both a virtue earned through sweat and something to do with idle hands, but Rustin’ in the Rain takes work itself as its defining subject matter. On “Percheron Mules,” he fantasizes about rolling around in the mud with a pack of mules, and the animal becomes a recurring motif throughout the album, whether literally on the cover or as a metaphor for the labor of relationships on the stirring ballad “In Your Love.”The catchy country-pop rhythm of the title track, buoyed by a twangy electric guitar solo, wouldn’t have sounded out-of-place in between Clint Black and Dwight Yoakam on Country Music Television in the 1990s, but Childers frequently channels a vision of the genre that predates the video era. Despite its tale of long-distance technological heartbreak, “Phone Calls and Emails” is a mournful jukebox waltz in the lineage of Willie Nelson standards like “Hello Walls.” The wistful “Luke 2:8-10” — featuring guest vocals from Margo Price, Erin Rae, and S.G. Goodman—is an ironic twist on a Nativity narrative, but the instrumentation is sincerely traditional, as an accordion squeezes away in three-quarter time. There’s gravel in Childers’ voice but a softness too, as he cries and yelps at the moon. The tender, plain-spoken quality of his tenor is what makes it stand out; he never feels strained or affected.",Folk,7.6
761,"On the final installment of their Trifecta series, the Detroit rap trio delivers quotable after quotable. It’s cocksure and playful, like a high school lunchroom cipher. At this point, ShittyBoyz are a well-oiled sports car with LEDs on the chassis and Supreme stickers embossed on the spoiler. Since they first gained traction through their single “No Hook 3” in 2018, emcees BabyTron, StanWill, and TrDee have honed their sly take on Michigan street rap into a reliable formula. Over a high-octane blend of dance, hyphy, and hardcore rap that couldn’t come from anywhere but the Motor City, they shoot off rounds of impish insults and flexes. (If their songs were any more Detroit, every album would come with a bottle of Everfresh.) It’s an approach that’s catapulted BabyTron into mainstream rap conversations, but StanWill and TrDee haven’t slowed down either, thanks to a prolific run of solo albums and wacky videos. Independently, they are already among Detroit’s most consistent rappers, but on their latest album, Trifecta 3: the Finale, they continue stunting as a unit, digging further into their world of deadpan zaniness.ShittyBoyz records largely stick to an established blueprint, mostly because each member of the trio has more freedom to experiment on their solo projects. BabyTron’s last album, 6, featured some of his most thoughtful and slowest-paced songs yet. Though StanWill and TrDee don’t deviate much from their go-to themes, the beats they gravitate toward feature strange, beguiling samples, even by their standards (On this year’s Early Mornings, Late Nights, TrDee’s baritone enchantingly clashes against the bright twinkling sample). In that sense, every ShittyBoyz album is like an Avengers team-up: They’re not here to complicate or challenge the lore, but they’re also not going to phone it in. Instead, they hit every trick and alley-oop with just enough nonchalance to elicit oohs and aahs from the crowd.And by now, that three-man weave is so effortless, it’s easy to get caught up in the excitement. On each of Trifecta 3’s 20 songs, they pull quotable after quotable out of the ether. Whether it’s hyperspecific sport references (“Flyin’ in a ’Hawk, I feel just like Dejounte Murray” from “Perfect 3”) or borderline dad jokes (“You not plugged in like a loose charger” from “Ball Players”), the bars range from quotidian profundities to genuine gut busters. BabyTron remains the star, a product of his unmatched charisma and cutting barbs (the way he sneers “You’re a pedophile” after TrDee’s R. Kelly joke on “Sh!tty Pack” almost made me fall out of my chair.) But all three of them sound best when they play off of each other in coordinated lyrical attacks. On the early album highlight “Tronald & Stanley,” Tron and Stan trade off after every bar, their references to DD Osama and scam-proof credit cards landing with the cocksure energy of a high school lunchroom cipher. “Game 7” pushes this dynamic to the extreme, with all three rappers sharing space in the same verse. They’re like different strands on a DNA triple helix, complementing each other’s themes and rhyme schemes in a brotherly bond.",Rap,7.1
762,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit a blockbuster R&B comeback record from 2005, an unofficial marker of a more self-actualized Mary J. Blige. Mary J. Blige wasn’t ready for a greatest hits moment just yet. By 2005, she was coming off her sixth studio album, Love & Life, an exuberant but untruthful Diddy-helmed affair that Blige later called a misstep. Within two years, her label Geffen had started prepping a legacy project in its wake titled Reminisce, which seemed like a career bow-out for Blige, then 34. She didn’t feel finished and had just, in fact, spent her past three projects introducing the world to a new and freer Mary. She felt confident enough to scrap the greatest hits set and fast-track her next album for a December 2005 release.At the time, Blige was awash in bliss, two years into a marriage with her manager, Kendu Isaacs, and ready to sing it to the heavens. Though the press described her seventh album, The Breakthrough, as a love letter to him, Blige insisted it was deeper than that. “It’s not just about choosing to be in love with him—it’s about choosing to be in love with myself,” she told Newsweek in 2005. The album reads less as a tribute to him and more like a sermon between Blige and the congregation of women who’ve seen themselves in her over the years. “I’m freeing myself,” she said to NPR in 2006, defining her breakthrough as not just one epiphany but an endless series of revelations. “I don’t think any of us will be free completely. It’s gonna take a lifetime to really get to that point.”What separates Blige from many other artists is that she is a believable work-in-progress. Every Mary J. Blige album is a chance for her to decompress, reboot, and present a stronger but softer version of herself. And yet, the dominant narrative is that Blige sings better when she’s in despair. Everybody wants her to stay sad for them. “I can make twenty more really depressed albums, but I choose to do something different,” Blige told NPR in 2006, echoing the classic text Sex and the City when a Paris-bound Carrie tells Miranda, “I cannot stay in New York and be single for you.”After 30 years of being trapped in heartbreak and misery, Blige deserved her redemption arc. Geffen positioned The Breakthrough for success, releasing it eight months after Mariah Carey’s own comeback effort, The Emancipation of Mimi, which proved how much a veteran R&B star could dominate pop with a resilient narrative if they also had a No. 1 hit like the Jermaine Dupri-produced “We Belong Together.” Jimmy Iovine, then chairman of Interscope Geffen A&M, commissioned producer Bryan-Michael Cox, who’d co-written Carey’s smash, to replicate a hit for Blige’s album. Relishing the opportunity to prove himself a legit hitmaker outside of working with Dupri, Cox composed the simple, rapturous piano melody behind The Breakthrough’s lead single “Be Without You” in under 15 minutes, then called in his frequent collaborator Johnta Austin, who’d won his first Grammy for writing “We Belong Together.” In a 2007 interview, Austin recalled nearly scrapping the hook for “Be Without You” at first (“We’ve been too strong for too long...”) because he said he’d “never really heard Mary sing a straight-up love song.”",Pop,8.8
763,"An exhaustively comprehensive 11-disc box set explores a defining work by the classic rock band alongside the ambitious, shelved concept album that would become Pete Townshend's white whale. At the beginning of the 1970s, the Who wanted to become the Greatest Band In The World. Their 1969 rock opera, Tommy, had vaulted them from theaters into arenas. Explosive performances at Woodstock and Monterey Pop were captured on film for everyone to see, and then they released Live at Leeds, the decibel-shattering record that cemented their legacy as the band heard blaring at full volume from the car stereos of every self-respecting rock’n’roll fan, from the stoners to the nerds. They had worked tirelessly for years to get to this very spot, but as soon as they did, the connection with their fans suffered due to larger venues and higher ticket prices. Reflecting in a 1971 Melody Maker column, Pete Townshend wrote, “At rock concerts you can achieve those rare moments where both group and audience forget themselves and become completely ego-less. The most precious moments of my life are on the stage when all is one.”This unflagging belief in the bond between the Who and their followers drove Townshend’s work on the songs that ended up on Who’s Next. Its genesis, development, and creation are extensively chronicled in Who’s Next | Life House, an 11-CD box set that beautifully communicates the spirit of the original project by opening up the vaults and inviting everybody inside.This anniversary release presents a remastered version of the original album, two discs of demos, two discs of working studio sessions, a disc of singles and outtakes, two different live concerts from 1971, and finally, a Blu-ray containing the original album and bonus tracks in Dolby Atmos and 5.1. It’s accompanied by extensive liner notes from Townshend along with longtime Who archivists Matt Kent and Andy Neill and a graphic novel that tells the story of Life House: the ambitious, never-completed concept album that inspired Who’s Next. This is the appropriate level of gravitas for a project that has always been Townshend’s great white whale, a lost epic that he has revisited multiple times, trying to finally get it right. (When Townshend launched his own website in 1999, there was a whole section for Life House, leading to a self-released 6-CD box set titled Lifehouse Chronicles, which sold out immediately.)The plot of Life House details a dystopic vision of the destruction of planet Earth, a militaristic regime that puts the population into virtual reality suits, and the existence of a central Grid controlled by mega-corporations. Rock’n’roll is banned because it will over-stimulate the Grid, and rebellion comes in the form of those who escaped and make it to the Life House, where each audience member would perform their own individual “note,” and after which they would achieve, yes, perfect harmony and ascend to Nirvana. Now that you can buy virtual reality headsets in a vending machine at the airport, this all sounds less fantastical than it did in the ’60s, but the complexity of this attempt at a coherent summary of the plot is symptomatic of why this box set, half a century later, is probably the closest Townshend will come to his vision being realized.",Rock,8.0
764,"On what feels like a companion to Time Skiffs, Animal Collective explore some surprisingly traditional psych-rock modes, but without abandoning their essential trickster spirit. For nearly as long as Animal Collective have been a band, they have reserved some of their best material for follow-up EPs. They may have originated as leftovers, but each stands on its own as a body of work. Isn’t It Now? is a full-length—in fact, at 65 minutes, it’s the longest album they’ve ever made—but it seems of a piece with those compact and giftlike interstitial releases. It arrives a year and a half after the late-career triumph Time Skiffs and features material from the same batch of songs, composed just before the pandemic, that populated that record. Two decades into a career full of left turns, it is perhaps the Animal Collective album that sounds the most like the one before it. But if anyone has earned the right to settle into a particular lane for a while, it’s Animal Collective. Isn’t It Now? demonstrates that they needn’t constantly reinvent themselves in order to make deep and rewarding music.On Isn’t It Now?, as on Time Skiffs, Animal Collective present themselves as something like a rock band. There are guitars, electric bass, and a full drum kit, rather than a ragtag assemblage of floor toms and sampler pads. For the first time since Feels or so, piano plays a central role, and not a piano that’s been distorted beyond recognition or looped infinitely through a delay pedal, but a regular old piano. The songs have adult concerns: “Defeat” and “Stride Rite” are odes to acceptance and perseverance; “Gem & I” namechecks simple pleasures like seeing the sun and cracking another beer; “Magicians From Baltimore” is about a hometown you love but had to leave. Accordingly, the band has toned down its most antic musical impulses. No screams, no sudden explosions of noise. The crescendos, when they happen, are subtle and patient. The tempos, like the volume level, are easygoing.Within that limited dynamic range, Animal Collective remain a spectacularly creative band. This mellower zone suits them: On albums like Centipede Hz and Painting With, the overstimulation that characterized their groundbreaking earlier work was showing signs of wear; in this most recent period, it’s as if they’d challenged themselves to reach listeners without relying on that playbook. Sometimes, that means making use of idioms outside the insular Animal Collective world. “Stride Rite,” for instance, is a contender for the most straight-up normal song in their catalog. Elegant and candlelit, featuring a rare Deakin lead vocal, it reminds me of something you’d hear on a singer-songwriter album from the twilight of the hippie era, where the protagonist is trying to piece together a meaningful story about what’s next after the utopian dream has fizzled out. “Let’s invite all the songs that we wrote so we’d know/And let them go,” he sings, with a melodic leap at the end that sounds like some combination of regret and hopeful anticipation. Avey Tare and Panda Bear’s songs tend to be so wrapped up in their respective idiosyncrasies as writers and singers that it’s difficult to imagine other people delivering them convincingly. If Deakin’s sensibility is a little more traditional, it’s also a little more universal: “Stride Rite” feels like it could belong to anyone, including you.",Experimental,8.0
765,"On their first album in nearly a decade, and following a wave of viral resurgence, the NYC avant-rock vets return with their warmest, most welcoming music yet. Over the past decade, we’ve grown accustomed to seeing veteran indie-rock acts enjoy a surprising surge in streams thanks to prime movie placements, sudden social-media virality, or inexplicable algorithmic voodoo. But the case of Blonde Redhead might be the strangest (with all due to respect to Galaxie 500). According to their Spotify stats, the New York trio’s most popular song by far—we’re talking a 65-million-stream margin—isn’t really a song at all. “For the Damaged Coda,” the closing track to 2000’s Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons, is a wordless elaboration of the piano ballad “For the Damaged,” a haunting, seance-conjured apparition of a song that was pretty ghostly in the first place. But thanks to the Rick and Morty music-supervision department, “For the Damaged Coda” not only became a recurring theme on the Adult Swim series, but also the sort of heavily memed clip that’s spawned YouTube compilations and trap remixes.There was a certain cruel irony in the fact a song that began as a time-killing lark—recorded by singer Kazu Makino while her twin-brother accomplices Amedeo and Simone Pace were sleeping at the studio—would become the defining work of a group that’s otherwise taken such a methodical approach to their craft. In the stellar seven-album run from 1995’s serrated self-titled debut to 2007’s shimmering shoegaze odyssey 23, Blonde Redhead had successfully pivoted from no-wave noisemakers to arthouse-indie auteurs, all while sustaining a highwire balance of melodic whimsy and needling tension. But that sort of frisson was in short supply on 2010’s Penny Sparkle and 2014’s Barragán, records that resembled mood boards of disparate sounds in search of songs, with little of the dramatic flair that powered the band’s previous transformations. In 2019, Makino released her first solo album, by which point Blonde Redhead had all but ground to a halt. Once the pandemic took hold, you could be forgiven for wondering if the band would still be standing on the other side of it. Arriving nine years on from their last full-length release, Sit Down for Dinner is the life-saving dose of CPR that gets this band’s oxygen flowing and blood pumping again.While they differed in style and scope, this band’s signature works—Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons, Misery Is a Butterfly, and 23—were united by a policy of swift and total immersion: Each led with a striking opening track that immediately thrust you into the album’s distinct three-dimensional sound, making it feel like you’ve been dropped into a film already in progress. Sit Down for Dinner honors that tradition with “Snowman,” which sets a deceptively languid tone with gleaming acoustic guitars and Amedeo’s beautifully sighed serenade. But an insistent rhythmic pulse—powered by percussionist Mauro Refosco—punches holes through the sparkling surface, restoring the contrast between fine-china delicacy and dark-cloud distress at the core of this band’s most resonant work.",Rock,7.5
766,"The SAULT vocalist’s new album explores faith and self-love through warm, lustrous neo-soul. Cleo Sol named herself after the sun. The UK singer is a vocalist for the enigmatic collective SAULT, which makes experimental R&B, funk, and disco-inspired music that speaks to the complexity of the Black experience. Over the past few years, she’s also released three balmy neo-soul albums that are in the lineage of Stevie Wonder and Erykah Badu and suffused with warm optimism: She sings about following your dreams, finding salvation in love, and honoring a higher purpose. Her music is radiant like a blooming peony, tender like butter left out on the counter. Sol’s latest project, Heaven, explores her usual themes of faith and self-love with a newfound ease and confidence.The piano-driven pop arrangements of her 2021 album Mother left a lot of room for Sol’s storytelling to take the stage. Heaven is a warmer, funkier, and more sonically diverse album, prioritizing the interplay between slick bass and synth and Sol’s voice as much as the lyrical messaging. Throughout, her falsetto is beautiful, floating over the production like fog drifting across a snow-capped mountain range. On “Go Baby,” she repeats the titular phrase over a meandering piano and gentle backing vocals, turning the directive into a twinkling meditation. And on “Nothing on Me,” Sol luxuriates in a fleet-footed bossa nova groove, occasionally weaving in her voice as a wisp of texture.Sol’s work cultivates inner joy that she then extends outwards. Released after the birth of her child, Mother was an empathetic project that demonstrated understanding toward her mother while also holding her accountable for the harm she caused. A similar sense of compassion guides Heaven; Sol examines relationships with friends, lovers, herself with sensitivity and care. “Miss Romantic” is a plea to a friend—or perhaps to herself—to stop humoring a man who continues to disrespect her. Sol is firm and direct as she lists the man’s many offenses, but ends the song on a string of sweet affirmations that underscore her deep affection for the other party: “You are brave, you are true, you won’t lose, trust in you” she croons, her voice echoing across a gentle guitar line and squiggly synth.Throughout the album, Sol keeps her storytelling diffuse and open-ended. On “Golden Child, (Jealous),” a breezy track with bird song and flitting drums, she repeats, “They’re just jealous of your mind/They’re just jealous ‘cause you’re kind,” leaving who “they” are unanswered. She is similarly vague on “Old Friends” as she expresses sadness about a relationship that ended, with lyrics like, “Distance and pain/Made my life feel smaller” and “Years have gone by, tears still stain my pillow/You played games with my emotions.” She always delivers her lines with poise and intention, but sometimes her writing can seem emotionally flat.Despite a few trite lyrics, there are many transcendent moments on Heaven. Sol is able to pivot between multiple emotional states—gratitude, calm, yearning—within the space of a single vocal run, like on album standout, “Heaven.” Her voice descends from an ethereal falsetto to a lower, golden-toned vibrato like red wine cascading from a glass carafe. The song establishes a mood so engrossing that notes seem to suspend in the air and reverberate around you even after the music stops, its beauty lingering like heat on your skin after a long day in the sun.",Pop,7.4
767,"The Chicago trio excels in precisely detailed ambient dub with just the right amount of reverence for turn-of-the-millennium avant-garde electronic music. Purelink’s debut single might have been a time machine. One track, the B-side’s “Head on a Swivel,” invoked the ’90s drum’n’bass of artists like Photek and Source Direct, in which breakbeats splintered like shards of glass over inky pools of bass. The A-side’s “Maintain the Bliss” was hazier in feel yet even more sharply focused on its contemporaneous reference points. Buoyed by vaporous clouds of synth, with featherweight filters sweeping back and forth over soft explosions of sub-bass, it was reminiscent of a strain of ambient techno perfected a quarter-century ago by acts like Vladislav Delay, Deepchord, and a little-known Glaswegian artist named Pub, whose 2000 dub-techno epic “Summer” drew the blueprint for Purelink’s blissed-out reverie.Obscure as these reference points may seem, they’re worth noting because they indicate just how specific Purelink’s vision is. All still in their twenties, the Chicago trio’s members—Tommy Paslaski (aka Concave Reflection), Ben Paulson (aka Kindtree), and Akeem Asani (aka Millia)—appear to be connoisseurs of a rarefied strain of Y2K-era experimental techno. But where many acolytes of bygone styles labor under the anxiety of influence, “Maintain the Bliss” felt effortless. It could easily have been a lost classic rescued from a 25-year-old DAT.The new album Signs keeps its gaze trained on the digital avant-garde of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The glinting contours of the opening “In Circuits” are reminiscent of Jan Jelinek and Oval, while the faintly dubwise rhythms and distant crackle recall Pole. In one sense, they’re right on time. With so many young musicians reanimating the skeletons of shoegaze, nu-metal, ’90s alternative, and jungle, it stands to reason that someone would devote equal attention to these marginal sounds from the same period.But Signs never feels expressly retro. That might be because there are so few obvious cultural associations to attach to these sounds in the first place—the so-called clicks + cuts movement was always among electronic music’s most faceless sectors, its unshowy practitioners stubbornly hidden behind their laptop screens. But what chiefly saves the record from feeling backward-looking is the sheer loveliness of the results. Ambient and dub techno have always foregrounded sensory pleasure, and Purelink excel in that department. Signs is a virtual steambath of foggy chords, chest-massaging bass, and sumptuous, ultra-vivid textures.They maintain a uniform mood of gentle repose across the whole 39-minute release. There’s nothing as insistent as a four-to-the-floor beat; where kick drums appear, they land only every so often, offering the merest hint of a pulse. Instead, movement comes from the way that synths and filters swirl, curling like foam along the shoreline. Tracks are largely monochromatic in tone, with the exception of “4k Murmurs,” whose gliding chord progression is the record’s emotional high point. At the same time, Purelink elevate themselves above more overtly functional chillout producers in their uncanny grasp of detail. These tracks tend to sit comfortably in the background; in fact, their lulling rhythms and hushed volume makes them difficult to concentrate on for long. But occasionally, a sound flashes out like a beacon—a crisply tapped ride cymbal, or a brisk tintinnabulation, or an unfamiliar chug cutting crosswise through the mix. Purelink’s hypnotic music is good at putting you under, but it rewards those occasions where you straighten up and snap to attention.",Electronic,7.8
768,"With help from producer Cate Le Bon, the Chicago band’s 13th album flickers to life on several songs that hint at the controlled chaos of their bygone experimental era. There are protest songs that rage with righteous fury. Then there are protest songs that simply gesture at the headlines, powerless and numb. “Ten Dead,” a glassy-eyed track on Wilco’s Cousin, is the latter. Counting up the casualties, Jeff Tweedy decries the normalization of mass shootings: “Turn on the radio, this is what they said/No more, no more, no more than ten dead,” he murmurs as Nels Cline’s nimble jazz chords surround and console him. Tweedy sounds more weary than outraged (“Ten more, 11 more/What’s one more to me?”) as a dust cloud of guitars commandeers the final minute. Isn’t that the point, though? It’s hard not to feel more weary than outraged when hearing about another massacre. The song, to its credit, indicts its own shrug.This is Wilco in their 30th year: more overtly political than ever—recall the double entendre of last year’s long-winded Cruel Country, with its patriot-baiting title track—yet musically more introverted. Channeling weariness is what Wilco do best these days, and on the refreshingly compact, fitfully surprising Cousin, weariness and uncertainty abound, elicited by violence, family (“Cousin”), and interpersonal relationships (“A Bowl and a Pudding”). After flirting with a youthful twang on Cruel Country, Tweedy scarcely raises his voice above a concerned hum. It’s a muted album about searching for connection amid decay, though it flickers to life on several tunes that hint at the controlled chaos of the much-mythologized Yankee Hotel Foxtrot/A era.Much as those albums benefited from the input of an experimental interlocutor (the great Jim O’Rourke), this one shakes up Wilco’s inner circle with outside producer Cate Le Bon, the Welsh songwriter, who squeezes some blood and guts out of these arrangements: the turbulent build-up in “Ten Dead,” the splattery organ groans that enhance the dirge-like “Pittsburgh.” During the recording process, Le Bon favored multitrack complexity over the live-in-the-studio approach of Cruel Country and encouraged the band to take more risks. That comes through on opener “Infinite Surprise,” which instantly feels like the most daring Wilco track this side of “Art of Almost.” Tweedy’s mantra-like repetitions (“It’s good to be alive/It’s good to know we die”) pair well with an ever-mutating symphony of synth shards and deconstructed guitar. As on many of Wilco’s best songs, Tweedy sounds like he’s reaching for stability in a storm and it keeps slipping just out of reach.A small bummer, then, that little else on Cousin summons that tension. The album’s middle stretch settles into an amiable midtempo blur. “Levee” and “Evicted” chug along on autumnal minor chords and climate dread, but it’s hard to imagine anyone but the realest Wilco heads differentiating them from listless deep cuts on Schmilco or Cruel Country. “Sunlight Ends” delivers one of Tweedy’s more oblique love songs, but its twinkling folktronica never quite lifts off. The lovely “A Bowl and a Pudding” spins a brooding variation on the undulating arpeggios of “Muzzle of Bees,” while the title track finally summons some jagged edges and post-punk vigor. “The dead awake in waves!” Tweedy repeats at the song’s snarling finish.",Rock,7.1
769,"The New York rappers team up with the legendary producer for their first full-length collaboration. Over his thick, sample-heavy beats, MIKE and Wiki brandish a natural chemistry that feels like it’s existed for decades. The Alchemist is not an unrealistic man; he understands that even his powers have limits. In an interview with Tidal in late 2022, the legendary beatmaker admitted that a full-length collaboration with two artists presents unique challenges. “It’s always a little different when you’re working with two people,” he said. “The result is just so much more unpredictable.” When he and New York rappers MIKE and Wiki announced that they were teaming up for Faith Is a Rock, it was logical to question how the trio would work together on an album. Fortunately, on “Bless” and “Sentry,” two of MIKE’s recent collabs with the Alchemist, his relaxed, almost lethargic raps sounded right at home.But introducing Wiki’s winding, introspective monologues into the fold created the potential for an overcrowded landscape. Faith Is a Rock soothes any potential fears; MIKE and Wiki navigate the Alchemist’s warped terrain as equals. They achieve a balance similar to Freddie Gibbs and Curren$y on 2018’s Fetti, delivering biting quotables and meandering soliloquies that reveal the full breadth of their powers. Over the 32-minute runtime, their raps never recede into the all-consuming mass of the Alchemist’s thick sample loops.This year has been prolific for the Alchemist: He executive produced three records (and one deluxe version), including Voir Dire, his most recent joint album with Earl Sweatshirt. But making that much music in succession could deplete anyone’s creativity: At some point, the boom-bap beats might start to resemble each other. Faith Is a Rock avoids that trap, introducing enough mood changes to keep things dynamic, all without sacrificing the overall tenor of the album. There are small but striking details scattered throughout, like the ghostly wails and sci-fi sound effects that adorn “Odd Ways,” the cartoonish chorus that carries the bare-bones background of “Bledsoe,” and the sound of pencil scratching on paper on “Scribble Jam.” The 45-year-old producer also incorporates vignettes, sprinkling in Gil Scott-Heron vocals, Bob Dylan recordings, and narrations from classic Western films as short intros. The focus here isn’t necessarily pushing the envelope, but crafting an environment that’s comfortable for both MIKE and Wiki.That approach ensures that the spotlight remains on the raps. When MIKE and Wiki on are on the same track, they are like two savvy veterans on the court working in lockstep with each other, expertly assessing their next moves. They grant each other space from the outset; on the opener “Stargate,” which boasts a string sample that sounds like it was ripped from a ’70s Blaxploitation film, is a prime example. Wiki drifts through autobiographical details, reminiscing about “sippin’ 40s at the 40th Pier,” and his words bleed fluidly into MIKE’s bars without losing momentum. Only two tracks here are solo efforts, a welcome homeostasis that allows each rapper to flex their gifts. Whether they’re trading truncated stanzas or spreading their legs out, neither feels rushed. There’s an intrinsic ease that rests in this relationship, a natural chemistry that feels like it’s existed for decades.",Rap,7.6
770,"The Japanese quartet evolve their perspective and sound, exploring the decadent grooves of city pop as they contend with growing up. CHAI’s songs glimpsed a band seemingly in a perpetual state of youth. Moles and blemishes became irresistible chocolate chips through their eyes; donuts were equally, if not more, important than a passionate crush. But on their new self-titled album, the exuberant Japanese band seems to be growing up, confronting changes in their personal tastes as well as their own bodies. “Every minute we age/More wrinkles than yesterday,” vocalist MANA sings over the effervescent synth-pop of “From 1992.” Despite the difference in her reflection, she embraces her look with confidence: “I don’t care/I want my skin to peek through my jeans full of holes.”This more mature perspective accompanies a gradual shift in the quartet’s sound. They made their name with speedy, rambunctious pop music infused with the immediacy of punk, their live-wire antics charged with a sense of youthful spontaneity. But on their last album, WINK, they began to venture outside of rock, channeling the casual, feel-good energy of Mac Miller and ‘90s R&B for unhurried pop jams that felt like daydreams. The band further settle into R&B and funk on their self-titled album, luxuriating in the decadent ‘80s grooves of Japanese city pop as well as the hydraulic bounce of bass music.The dance floor serves as the ground on which CHAI explore their own politics of Neo-Kawaii, reclaiming beauty standards and self-love in their own image. “PARA PARA” is a sultry electro-disco anthem for a night out; the band turn their bedroom mirror pep talks into self-empowering hooks. “I should practice my kissing,” MANA sings in the chorus, as if to manifest what’s in store for her later. She leans into vanity on the bouncy, elastic “LIKE I NEED,” snapping selfies to fish for attention on Instagram. At its best, the peppy dance production can sound as invigorating as their old punk music.CHAI’s more explicitly political efforts unfold rather predictably, their messaging losing power as they paint in broad strokes. The riotous new wave statement “NEO KAWAII, K?” is built to cause a scene, but its instructional lyrics can feel flat. The stomping funk number “We the Female!” can seem similarly one-dimensional; its all-for-one hooks—“I’m human, how about you?” and “Mighty, yet feminine”—echo as shallow celebrations of womanhood. CHAI’s music resonates more when they get more personal, like on the sparkling album closer “Karaoke,” which conveys their tight-knit connection. As they muster the courage to sing their favorite songs, they reveal the messiest versions of themselves, the band at their most honest and compelling.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

771,"The Brooklyn synth-pop trio expands its signature sound on its surprisingly idiosyncratic third album. Nation of Language made their first two albums in the confines of the pandemic, and their lean and understated synth-pop was hewn from varying degrees of convenience. Keyboardist Aidan Noell, who is married to vocalist Ian Devaney, learned to play MicroKORG and Moog Sub Phatty Analog synths to help realize their vision. At their wedding, Devaney and Noell skipped a traditional gift registry and instead fundraised for their 2020 debut Introduction, Presence. Strange Disciple, their first project freed from the confines of lockdown and in the tour van, is still another achievement in economy, a project that looks to the sound of new wave as a springboard, not a textbook, and lets small touches shine.With LCD Soundsystem’s Nick Millhiser producing the album, the group incorporates new sounds into their typically minimalist compositions. More live drums and more live guitar mean these songs fill larger spaces. The raw material doesn’t hurt either: Noell’s increasingly intuitive synth lines provide a handy pathway toward a rousing indie-rock sound that harkens back to Devaney’s origins in 2010s punk outfit the Static Jacks. (He first landed on synth-pop after a pivotal encounter with Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark’s 1979 single “Electricity.”) Bassist Alex MacKay’s melodic dexterity also tightens the screws on a signature sound beyond their formative influences.Still, there’s no listening to Nation of Language without hearing the 1980s: icy lighting, rigid hip movements, starched collars. And yet pure nostalgia doesn’t fuel the project. Nation of Language are as quick to evoke millennial forebears like the Postal Service or Bloc Party as icons like the Smiths and Human League, and Strange Disciple’s songs are mostly happening right now, awash in lust or confusion. The band communicates these messy emotions with small idiosyncrasies that go a long way toward evolving their sound: See the soft synth collapses at the end of “Stumbling Still” and “A New Goodbye,” or the clanging chimes of “Sightseer.”Across the album, Devaney sings in a downcast timbre that recalls Majical Cloudz’s Devon Welsh squared at festivals instead of DIY venues. He sounds most gripping when he uses it to curl his way around unfussy statements, as in opener “Weak in Your Light.” When he glides into his upper register on the line “I’m in love,” he hits the same sweet spot as in the group’s career-best songs: moments when he soars on one hypnotic syllable, his voice becoming indistinguishable from the synths around it. The best songs on Strange Disciple transform into more than the sum of their parts. When the synths and live instrumentation and hooks all coalesce, as on standout “Spare Me the Decision,” it is clear that Millhiser is the group’s secret weapon. He accompanies them with cascading layers of analog synths that still highlight the staples of their identity: the influences, the chemistry, the songcraft. By now, Nation of Language are well-versed in the ways of “less is more.” On Strange Disciple, they’re also learning what it means to get bigger and better.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

772,"On her third album for Hyperdub, the UK experimental musician uses chaotic arrangements and glitchy drums to express knotty, difficult-to-name emotions. The Kübler-Ross model has done the bereaved dirty ever since it entered the public consciousness in the 1970s. Its five tidy stages are woefully inadequate to handle the myriad shifting forms of grief: unpredictable physical manifestations, the random recovery or loss of memories, slow-dawning realizations, circular ruminations. Time doesn’t heal all wounds, but it can help form emotional scar tissue. Loraine James’ third album for Hyperdub, Gentle Confrontation, is a self-examination of the marks and bruises inflicted by a significant loss in childhood. James has always wielded her voice as a malleable tool—sometimes sharpened into a jagged point between glitchy stop-start arrangements and skittering drums, other times barely perceptible beneath woozy pitch bends and plaintive synth chords. But with Gentle Confrontation she sounds newly and vocally vulnerable. “When I was seven my dad went to heaven, possibly,” she croons on “2003,” the album’s lead single. “I looked at the sky: uncertainty/It hurt me, uncertainty.”In the six years that she’s been releasing music, James has proven herself to be a gifted moodsmith with no shortage of textures to meditate within. Alongside two previous albums of dancefloor-skewed IDM, there was a tender tribute album to minimalist composer Julian Eastman, Building Something Beautiful for Me, and a self-titled LP from her ambient project Whatever the Weather, all released at an impressive pace. In retrospect, it now seems that the Eastman project and Whatever the Weather may have been necessary precursors for James to tap into the marrow of such heartfelt material on Gentle Confrontation. The album’s self-titled opening track elegantly bridges the full expanse of James’ identities in an introduction that feels suitably cinematic: A dramatically swelling orchestral arrangement is given generous space to establish a doleful emotional register before being joined by electronic pulses and sampled drum loops.Loraine James Takes Electronic Music’s Temperature With New Alias Whatever the WeatherGentle Confrontation sprawls, and each track settles into a distinct tonality. James mirrors her raw lyrics on “2003” with a spare musical arrangement that consists of little more than the rhythmic movement of air through gasping levers and bellows. The coolly modern R&B production of “Let U Go” is remarkable for its subtly twisted feeling of discombobulation: Samples run in reverse beneath wonky chords; vocal processing renders indie R&B darling KeiyaA’s voice unrecognizable. Other standouts include “I DM U,” which pits James’ heady, unpredictable programming against the sharp sticks of Black Midi drummer Morgan Simpson. “Cards With the Grandparents” turns inwards, transforming a vignette of family life into an abstract sound study: James samples the sounds of a shuffling deck, laughter, and conversation, but she balances the light-hearted patter with a dose of melancholy (“My grandad has dementia, but he’s still very cool”).",Electronic,8.0
773,"The pop singer’s full-length debut is a bold and uproarious introduction, buoyed by sturdy songcraft and steely indifference to good taste. You grow up in the Midwest; your dreams sprawl wider than the freeways; the big city starts to beckon. Chappell Roan, daughter of Willard, Missouri, secured her ticket out through YouTube, where as a teenager she uploaded the cover songs that got her a major label deal before she finished high school. She started spending time in L.A. and recorded a series of dour, downtempo pop tunes. But Willard still had her in its grasp: In a promotional video from 2017, released around the same time as her first EP, Roan gazes mistily out a plane window and admits, “When I go back to L.A., I just don’t feel as grounded as I do when I’m home.”When her music lacked place and purpose, Roan found both at the Abbey. The storied West Hollywood gay bar inspired “Pink Pony Club,” a disco ball-dappled ode to escaping the suburbs for the California nightclubs. The song, released in 2020, effectively ended one chapter of Roan’s career: Her label, Atlantic, dropped her after its release. But it also pointed in a new direction. The “Pink Pony Club” is back open for business on The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, Roan’s full-length debut, a bold and uproarious pop project stitched with stories about discovering love, sex, and oneself in a new place. Marking her debut for Island Records, it’s buoyed by youthful vim and steely indifference to the bounds of good taste.Chappell Roan’s Gloriously Unserious PopMidwest Princess was written and produced with Dan Nigro, the onetime indie frontman who has recently gained prominence via his creative partnership with Olivia Rodrigo. As songwriters and performers, Rodrigo and Roan agree on a lot: Both are committedly theatrical and wickedly funny, even in the face of emotional indignity. “Casual,” Midwest Princess’s high point, lobs a cocktail of sorrow and scorn at a romantic partner who refuses to acknowledge the significance of their situationship. “Knee deep in the passenger seat and you’re eating me out/Is it casual now?” Roan deadpans in the chorus, cramming one of the record’s most vivid images into a single breath. The outro turns up the heat and raises the stakes: “I fucked you in the bathroom when we went to dinner/Your parents at the table, you wonder why I’m bitter?”Roan is blessed with a powerful and versatile voice, heard in full force on the blowout final line of “Casual.” On the otherwise unremarkable “After Midnight,” she floats some lovely whistle tones; on “Picture You,” she channels Patsy Cline, her voice warm and full-bodied, her phrasing immaculate. But, also like Rodrigo, she can be persuasive with less precise or tuneful deliveries. In the half-spoken, half-yelped bridge of the yeehaw booty call “Red Wine Supernova,” her comedic potential is maximized (“I heard you like magic?/I’ve got a wand and a rabbit!”). She zips through the verses of “Hot To Go!” with all the urgency of a spark burning through a fuse, then calls in the pep squad to spell-sing the title.",Pop,7.2
774,"The experimental musician’s radiant new album explores love’s rapture within the confines of more traditional pop structures. Eartheater songs, which reference chrysalises, diamonds, and other natural symbols of metamorphosis, sound like they emerge from an analogous process of transformation. Alexandra Drewchin takes amorphous elements and alters them into something rare and precious, incorporating grinding digital noise and austere beats into works of ornate avant-pop. Over the years she has steadily centered her voice as her primary instrument, the centrifugal force pulling together the dissonant pieces of her tracks. On her sixth album Powders, the first of twin records, she gets the closest she has to mainstream pop, exploring more traditional song structures and less adorned production.When Drewchin approached pop in the past, it was typically in the form of absurd meditations on attraction; she told a partner to “grow gills, bring a snorkel” on 2019’s “Supersoaker.” On Powders, Drewchin aims to capture the transformative power of love. Flute arpeggios shoot out from under trembling synths as she details total rapture on opener “Sugarcane Switch”: “Put the sun to sleep, he’s tired/And I’m awake and inspired.” The lovestruck mood continues onto “Crushing,” an ambling trip-hop ballad composed of a series of interlocking lyrics, the end of each line becoming the beginning of the next. “You’re the fuse that detonates my body/You’re the body that blows my mind,” she sings. It’s a song that could reasonably keep going until language runs out. The two tracks are some of Drewchin’s best work as Eartheater, showcasing her skill for guiding surreal beauty out of sprawling, fluid arrangements.Drewchin’s voice—sometimes multi-layered and distorted, other times untouched—has been her anchor since her solo debut Metalepsis in 2015. On Powders, it takes on a more prominent role, less processed than on previous records. While her performance is often impressive, her voice can feel trapped within the album’s more structured writing. On “Mona Lisa Moan” and “Pure Smile Snake Venom,” two of the most by-the-book songs Drewchin has ever released, her delivery sounds dulled, especially in contrast to the album’s radiant beginning.In exploring her primary interest, a person’s capacity for change, Drewchin routinely evokes violence. It’s present in her monstrous stage name and was central to her last album, 2020’s Phoenix: Flames Are Dew Upon My Skin. It’s present in System Of A Down’s nu-metal classic “Chop Suey!,” which she covers halfway through Powders, singing of “self-righteous suicide” and dying angels. But instead of staying true to the original, Drewchin drains the song of its aggression, pairing her quiet voice with a simple guitar melody before the song blooms with percussion and piano. Transformation can be brutal, she seems to imply, but the most radical change can also be lovely and gentle.",Experimental,7.5
775,"The experimental artist’s fifth solo album is among her best, a beautiful collection of minimalist ambient compositions in which no line extends for long without dissolving into an inky blot. “Atlas” is a weighty term for a weighty tome—hardbacked, oversized, cutting the whole world down into perfect-bound pages. To the mythologically inclined, it has other associations, too—namely, the weight of the world itself, resting heavily on a Greek Titan’s brawny shoulders. But whatever Laurel Halo may have been thinking when she hit upon the title, this strange, beguiling record has little in common with either reference. It offers neither the certainties of cartography nor the force required to sustain such an oppressive planetary burden. To the contrary: Halo’s fifth solo album maps a diaphanous universe in which no line extends for long without dissolving into an inky blot, and even the densest, most massive shapes might disintegrate beneath a puff of breath.Halo—an American electronic musician, DJ, and composer who made her name in New York and Berlin, and recently relocated to Los Angeles, where she teaches at Cal Arts—has had a singular career, with no two records alike. Her earliest releases danced on the fringes of the nascent vaporwave movement; she has since explored avant-pop, splintered techno, and alien, biomorphic vocal treatments. In recent years, she has increasingly foregrounded abstraction and dissonance, and her new album is clearly an extension of the lines of inquiry behind 2018’s Raw Silk Uncut Wood and 2020’s Possessed soundtrack. Here as there, atmosphere and texture take precedence over rhythm or melody. But where Raw Silk Uncut Wood could meander, sometimes privileging process over outcome, Atlas—for all its seeming difficulty—is exponentially more invested in the experience of pleasure. Even its most impenetrable passages morph into gorgeous, sweeping strings or bittersweet piano cadenzas. It might be the most moving record of Halo’s career.Atlas came together in 2020 and 2021, a period Halo has called “a disquieting and sleepy moment in all our lives.” For inspiration, she looked to things she was selecting for Awe, her monthly show on London online radio NTS: ambient music, electroacoustic composition, minimalism, and jazz piano. Another influence was the “slow-cinema” auteur Apichatpong Weerasethakul, whose films she has praised for their “humor, hidden detail, and dream logic”—all qualities that animate Atlas. (The humor may be harder to pick out, but it’s there, I think, in the sheer bewilderingness of the record’s dissonance; its opacity, at points, verges on absurdism, like an existentialist joke.) A residency at Paris’ historic ina-GRM studios gave Halo the opportunity to run keyboard sketches through arcane electronic gizmos, producing an otherworldly palette that is neither strictly acoustic nor obviously digital. She also relied on a few close collaborators (saxophonist Bendik Giske, cellist Lucy Railton, violinist James Underwood, and, singing on “Belleville,” Coby Sey), yet their contributions tend to be routed back into the album’s murky matrix. Everything—even Halo’s own wordless, stacked vocal harmonies—is subservient to the foggy totality. Nothing survives vaporization; nothing remains whole.",Electronic,8.1
776,"The Venezuelan singer-songwriter’s 11th album tackles grief and melancholia with the kind of endearing eccentricity only he can. Devendra Banhart has never shied away from the esoteric. On “Für Hildegard von Bingen,” from 2013’s Mala, he recast the eponymous 12th-century Christian mystic as a “VJ on rotation” over a playful disco-rock groove. “María Lionza,” from 2009’s What Will We Be, is a dreamlike guitar and saxophone instrumental that references the Venezuelan syncretic deity by name. For Banhart’s 11th album Flying Wig, the once-king of freak folk softens his purview into something resembling a meditative peace chant. Produced by Welsh art-rock songwriter Cate Le Bon, the 10-track collection tackles heartbreak, forgiveness, and melancholia. Taking inspiration from “This Dewdrop World,” a poem by Japanese lay Buddhist priest and “Great Four” haiku master Kobayashi Issa, Banhart approaches somber themes with whimsy. Songs about losing phone chargers, or tales written from the perspective of nuns on the run, take on unexpectedly profound meanings.While Flying Wig does indeed ascend, it never quite lands on solid ground—which feels like the whole point. Here, the one-time king of freak folk continues his avoidance of the campfire setting and acoustic instrumentation of his early work in favor of ethereal, synth-driven cuts and sleepy slacker rock. The focus on synthesizers results in a warm and pervasive hum, a floaty fantasia that threatens—in gentle, low whispers—to nod off at any moment.Banhart’s first solo record in four years is funny and endearingly weird, even as it sings of life’s heaviness. The influence of Le Bon, who also played synth, guitar, percussion, bass, and piano on the album, is palpable in the slow-thudding drum machines on “Fireflies” (which plays out like a Beach House B-side) and quietly anthemic single “Twin,” both bolstered by a droning synth. Banhart has praised Le Bon for pushing him to new heights, and you can hear what he means in the album’s subtle moments of transcendence. “Charger” wraps a tender reflection of love lost in a silly, overarching metaphor (“It looks like I’ve lost my charger”) that gives way to a heavenly choir. On the title track, he assumes the perspective of a wig hanging off a mic stand, describing himself as “alone/Dancing naked/On an eye/Without a head.”Banhart’s contemplative yet easygoing approach strikes a kind of surrealist gold. This levity isn’t new territory for him, but it allows Flying Wig’s strange images and Morphean soundscapes to vibrate on a higher plane. He also tapped into the divine feminine, donning a sky-blue Issey Miyake gown and his grandmother’s pearls throughout the recording process. The dress has been present at recent live shows, most notably last year’s Caracas’ Cusica Festival, his first-ever show in Venezuela. In press materials, Banhart explained that writing and singing in the dress parallels experiences from his childhood, when he would don his mother’s gowns: “It wasn’t about sexuality, just connecting with my feminine side and feeling that I had permission…It felt like a power. And that’s a very safe and comfortable place for me.” In its enveloping comfort, Flying Wig mirrors that feeling of safety.Banhart has been drawing from queer aesthetics for years, a known follower of androgynous Haight-Ashbury ’60s collective the Cockettes who has set songs in the Castro district of San Francisco and written others as a femme. As he continues toying with gender, genre, open-hearted expression, and some of his most oblique songwriting yet, perhaps unintentionally, his work expounds on a crucial tenet of queerness: liberation in lightness and in unabashed optimism.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

777,"This score to the 1973 sci-fi film was sampled by generations of hip-hop luminaries. Reissued for its 50th anniversary, it remains a dazzlingly avant-garde fusion of styles and moods. While René Laloux’s 1973 animated film La Planète Sauvage (Fantastic Planet) is celebrated for its enduringly shocking, Dali-esque visuals, Alain Goraguer’s soundtrack is a surrealist triumph in itself. Composed for the French-language story of a planet where humans are hunted and domesticated by gigantic blue aliens, its orchestral fusion of jazz, prog rock and modern classical still feels—as the film’s adverts once trumpeted—“Strange! Frightening! Fascinating!”Goraguer ought to be better known. Born in 1931, he was a go-to arranger for French pop giants like Serge Gainsbourg, Jean Ferrat, and France Gall, but he often avoided the limelight, using pseudonyms like Milton Lewis or Laura Fontaine. Despite the global stardom his music helped others achieve, his death in February of this year went relatively unpublicized. His score for La Planète Sauvage has similarly left a legacy from the shadows, having been sampled by generations of major hip-hop artists. Appearing the summer of DJ Kool Herc’s block party, it was dusted off in the ’90s by KRS One and Big Pun, in the ’00s by Madlib (as Quasimoto) and J Dilla, and over the past decade by Mac Miller, Little Simz, Flying Lotus and Denzel Curry, and Run the Jewels. A new 50th-anniversary reissue—including 10 unreleased cuts—is a fresh reminder that Goraguer’s score is a true avant-garde gem.Most of the original score’s 25 short pieces refer to two motifs that first appear in the prowling, noirish opener, “Déshominisation (I)”: a descending melody and a twanging bass riff first heard amid a jazz drum groove, trembling orchestral strings, and flashes of flanged guitar. While iterating on a core motif is a common device in film scores, the extent of Goraguer’s repetition is striking. (A looming deadline may have necessitated his recycling: After the French-Czech co-production dragged on for five years—a period interrupted by the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia—Goraguer was brought on at the very end, and given just weeks to complete his score.) Regardless, each instance is full of new twists: The melody reappears as jaunty pop in “Le bracelet,” terrifying stabs in “La cité des hommes libres,” and an eerily romantic waltz in “Les fusées / Valse des statues.”While an enormous procession of orchestral and rock instruments (from saxophones to flexatones) adds variety and color, the real joy is in Goraguer’s far-ranging uses of recurring elements. Standouts include the expressive female vocals, which deliver a melancholy solo on “Terr et Tiwa dorment” and eerily seductive sighs on “La Femme.” If this might be expected from an arranger for great chansonnières like Isabelle Aubret, his wildly contrasting electric-guitar arrangements are more surprising: from Derek Bailey-esque probing on “Attaque des robots” to dramatic soloing on “Générique (Fin).”",Jazz,8.0
778,"In proving herself as a rapper, Doja Cat offers up an uneven album that is accomplished but gets bogged down in reactive and repetitive songs. Doja Cat’s arachnidemonic no-features rap album would like a word with anyone who ever said that she’s not really a rapper. Scarlet asserts Doja’s ability to rap, and her right to be multi-talented and difficult—“difficult art” is high praise. If only anything about Scarlet were difficult. It’s reactive and repetitive, pairing unsurprising takes on traditionalist hip-hop with sharp retorts to last season’s insults. Conceptually, the album is pitched somewhere between Rico Nasty’s Anger Management and Taylor Swift’s Reputation, a razor-edged heel turn that has always something to prove. It’s probably the biggest album to be so concerned with posting, which doesn’t give it the blockbuster quality it deserves.Doja Cat has answered doubters before, once saying that “it’s fine if people think that I can’t rap,” but Scarlet—working title First of All—implies maybe it isn’t anymore. In one of many spring-summer 2023 tweets later deleted, but not before they made headlines, Doja wrote, “i also agree with everyone who said the majority of my rap verses are mid and corny…. I just enjoy making music but I’m getting tired of hearing yall say that i can’t so I will.” Scarlet’s relatively straight-ahead approach to hip-hop sounds like ’90s boom-bap retrofitted with an eye to contemporary sample drill, rage, and cloud rap. Frequent Lil Yachty collaborator Earl on the Beat has a hand in four tracks including singles “Paint the Town Red” and the dreamy love song “Agora Hills”; Jay Versace is behind the most California-sounding beats, channeling West Coast old school on “97” and L.A. beat scene on “Often.” A generous sample budget pays for classic material like the Ric Flair soundbite on “Balut” and Earl’s Dionne Warwick sample, the first sound on the album: a dove of peace over Evil Doja’s shoulder in “Paint the Town Red,” the No. 1 hit that’s an exact fit for her fake-bloodied, take-no-prisoners horrorcore persona.After the opening “Red” and “Demons,” Scarlet is a purgatorial run of similarly paced songs that play like progressively shallower echoes of the singles’ pride and bluster. Moment to moment Doja’s performance is dynamic—sweet falsetto, thick nasal drawl—but her writing can make her sound like a sore winner bringing playground taunts to a flame war (“You look like a butter face”) and flatlining on “Love Life” as she congratulates her business team. Remy Ma, who last year reported that the Doja Cat fanbase “came for my life” after she’d said she didn’t think of Doja as a rapper, merits a subtle dig hidden in a stream of punning wordplay on “Ouchies,” and Doja spends not a little time beefing with those same “extremist” superfans on her own behalf, commentating on minor controversies and reminding them that every hate click counts.",Rap,5.9
779,"Drawing on the sounds of ’90s Eurodance and classic rock’n’roll, these six songs are light, lush, and streaked with melancholy. It took Mykki Blanco years to bloom into their current arc. After almost a decade of putting out raucous, multi-modal hip-hop collections, the artist’s sound softened and brightened for 2021’s Broken Hearts and Beauty Sleep. The LP that followed, 2022’s gorgeous, guest-spangled Stay Close to Music, deepened Blanco’s range even further. Joined by the likes of Saul Williams, Ah-Mer-Ah-Su, and Anohni, Blanco luxuriated in introspection, juxtaposing playful club romps like “Ketamine” with clear-eyed musings on queerness, Blackness, and femininity, like “Carry On” and “Your Feminism Is Not My Feminism.” Their latest release, Postcards From Italia, features six songs recorded in the same rush as their past two albums, continuing their prismatic collaboration with producer FaltyDL. Clocking in at just 16 minutes, Postcards is light, lush, and streaked with intermittent melancholy. It hits like a breeze on a top-down drive along the Mediterranean coast.With bright, crisp guitars and shuffling beats, Postcards edges closer to classic rock’n’roll than Blanco’s ever taken us before, replete with the genre’s originating burst of sexual delight. Opener “Magic on My Back” layers multiple eras of rock’s historical resonance. A Bo Diddley guitar strum flowers over a wobbling bass line that immediately summons up Lou Reed’s tribute to the trans girls of 1970s New York, “Walk on the Wild Side,” itself a warm but muted rehash of 1950s rock’n’roll ingredients. And then, at the fore of the mix, a punchy kick-snare drum pattern calls in “Wild Side”’s 1990 reinvigoration as a sample in the hands of A Tribe Called Quest, “Can I Kick It?” All those decades coalesce to set the stage for one of Blanco’s most joyful, exuberant tracks to date, a song about sex so good the whole world floods with pleasure. “You do it slow/Can’t help but smile,” they sing on two simultaneous vocal tracks, playing both the smooth, sultry backup singer and the charismatic, off-the-cuff bandleader.Darker, more ambivalent notes waft through the middle of the EP, though the production’s sheen never dulls. Across a handful of mostly bite-sized tracks, Blanco considers all the ways people can fall out of synch with each other, even while standing in the glow of real love. The twinkling R&B ballad “Love Fell Down Around Me” renders a breakup through precise, tactile details: “Your tears on blue jeans/My coffee on the living room floor.” On the hazy, psychedelic “Just a Fable,” Blanco sings about kissing a tearful white lover in the midst of the 2020 uprisings after the killing of George Floyd. ""It was a fable of the city/It was a fable of the U.S.A.,"" they sing over a bounding bass line. The vignette collapses and expands its scale from thousands of people in the streets to two people in a room and back again—intimacy huddled inside a world-historical movement, ballooning to the size of myth.The EP’s closing bookend “Holidays in the Sun” spikes the BPM to a club pulse. William Eaves’ production calls back to the blunt abandon of flash-in-the-pan Eurodance acts like Haddaway and La Bouche, whose maximal sound ricocheted back to the United States with comic frisson during the mid-’90s. Blanco’s pitch-shifted voice swings across the song’s title in a repeatedly triggered sample; on the verses, they curl their consonants to affect a country drawl. Blanco has always approached their vocals with a generous sense of play, quick to don and shed exaggerated characters on a dime, and their Eurodance persona is no different. “I believe in love and I believe in going hard,” they proclaim over the dance floor in a hypnotic Sprechstimme. The beat throbs, incessant, leading all the loose threads and fractured hearts throughout the EP to sweet release.",Rap,7.1
780,"The Chilean band journeys through icy, alien frontiers on their mesmerizing new album. Föllakzoid’s V begins like an incoming transmission from a distressed spaceship. The barbed remnants of a synth tone modulate and wriggle; low-slung bass notes throb with menace; a kick lumbers into the mix as spiky harmonics jut against it in a syncopated rhythm. After swirling around each other for nearly two minutes, the elements click into place, the groove snapping into focus. But instead of moving in any clear direction, we’re ushered further into the void, staring wide-eyed at the vast expanse the band conjures.Over the past 14 years, the Chilean band, led by guitarist and filmmaker Domingæ Garcia-Huidobro, has set out to explore psychedelia’s outermost reaches. While they made their name referencing the scorched riffs and repetitive chug of bands like Hawkwind and Loop, on 2015’s III, they shifted toward the insistent pulse of dance music, assisted by German producer Atom™ (née Uwe Schmidt). They pushed further into electronic territory on 2019’s I, foregoing in-person jam sessions and instead handing Schmidt 60 independently recorded parts to arrange as he saw fit. This time on V, they compiled more than 70 stems and relinquished any control over the music’s structure.The result is the group’s most pupil-dilating record, straddling the line between vicious minimal techno and heady space rock. Whereas previous Föllakzoid records topped out around 120 bpm, Schmidt sets V’s tracks to about 130, what some consider the sweet spot for techno and trance music. His arrangements are more dynamic and detailed than ever, the standard four-four thump of the kick drums augmented with tom fills and splashy cymbals. The music is often brutal enough to soundtrack a blood rave, but has gentler moments, resembling the verdant synthesized ecosystems of Voices from the Lake or Segue.Each piece contains tiny, spellbinding moments of beauty amid the echoing din. Guitars, mostly relegated to single note accents or pick scrapes, ring into infinity through trembling delay. There aren’t really melodies or chord progressions to speak of, but synth notes sometimes cluster around each other, momentarily coalescing and fading away. In the final minutes of “V - III” the bass pokes out from behind a screen of shimmering noise and plays an almost optimistic-sounding figure that never repeats again, like a fleeting gasp of oxygen in an endless vacuum.Though Föllakzoid has traded some of their initial accessibility for intricacy, the result is ultimately mesmerizing. The album’s chilliest and best song is “V - II,” which white-knuckles through serrated distortion and uneasy drones. Galloping noise anxiously lopes just ahead of the beat, giving way to a latticework of shuddering, colorless guitar. About midway through, the drums expand into a rollicking pattern, collapsing into massive EDM-like bass wubs. Suddenly, everything cuts out, leaving you blinking. V is relentless in its intensity, but allow yourself to be swept into its icy, alien atmosphere you’ll be utterly awestruck.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

781,"On her new EP, Sophie Allison rents out a room just for herself, singing covers of Taylor Swift, Pavement, Sheryl Crow, and more. Sophie Allison might be exactly the type of person you don’t want to do karaoke with: Instead of screeching off-key high notes four vodka crans deep, she’s making it good and making you think. On her new EP Karaoke Night, she rents out a room just for herself, singing covers she’s performed live as Soccer Mommy but never recorded until now. It’s simultaneously an homage to her varied influences and a manifesto for her own dreamy sound.Some covers make you reimagine what the original actually means, like “Soak Up the Sun,” which Allison released in July to align with Sheryl Crow’s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Crow wrote the track while recovering from surgery, and it comes across as a gleaming, upbeat anthem championing a better mindset. Allison’s version is messier and more contemplative, almost as if she’s trying to convince herself of its positivity. The chorus is a fuzzy, watery expanse, leaving only a warped memory of the original bubblegum pop. The words “I’m gonna tell everyone to lighten up” feel more ironic than earnest.Allison’s treatment of “I’m Only Me When I’m With You” has a similar effect. Swift’s track is classic Debut Taylor, with its fiddle solo and her exaggerated country twang. Allison’s slightly slower tempo and matter-of-fact vocal delivery highlight the gravity of the situation: “I’m only me when I’m with you.” Instead of soundtracking a local hoedown in full swing, the song begins under a spinning disco ball in a barn with only four people left on the floor. Even when the beat kicks in, there’s still an element of ennui that comes through amidst its sweetness.Other covers offer a direct line to Allison’s work. Pavement’s classic ballad “Here” is even in the same key and tempo range as “Still,” the closer to her 2022 album Sometimes, Forever. Her rendition opens the EP, and her laissez-faire delivery mirrors that of the original, but with an added sincerity: While Malkmus sings lines like “Your jokes are always bad/But they're not as bad as this” with rueful jadedness, Allison sounds like she’s still putting in effort despite exhaustion. The EP’s other bookend is R.E.M’s “Losing My Religion,” a song that has always felt oddly buoyant despite being about unrequited love. Allison leaves no question of its melancholia, changing the main chords to be more dissonant.Each song on Karaoke Night reckons to some degree with temporality and impermanence, themes threaded throughout Allison’s past projects. “The world is full of noise/I hear it all the time” from Slowdive’s “Dagger” is the kind of quasi-nihilistic line that might have appeared in her songs “Darkness Forever” or “Crawling In My Skin.” It validates that she is not alone in her self-doubt, devotion, and existential malaise, despite how isolated she may feel sometimes. These ideas are ageless, whether they’re shared in front of a crowd or alone with a single microphone.",Rock,7.0
782,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit a monumental artifact of soul—one of the best live albums of all time, from the singer who wrote the 20th century’s defining civil rights anthem. About three-quarters of the way through One Night Stand! Live at the Harlem Square Club, the beat stops and Sam Cooke says he’s gotta tell us about his baby right now. Backed by drumrolls, clattering cymbals, and a swaying buzz of minor-chord guitar, Cooke is speak-singing, hoarsely, in a free-flowing cadence. He and his lover fussed and fought; she left; he feels so alone; and now he has to banter with a telephone operator before finally—finally!—he gets through to her. “I got a message for you, honey/I wanna tell you that darling you-u-u-u-uuuu, ohhhhhhh,” he roars, desperate and teasing. The crowd can’t stand it, erupts in shrieks; you can pick out individual voices. Smoke and booze hang in the sweaty Saturday night air. Cooke starts up again: “You send me.”It’s a sly twist on Cooke’s first pop hit and only No. 1, “You Send Me,” originally released in 1957. At Miami’s Harlem Square Club, he bats the title around twice more, each time heightening the expectation he’ll switch into the familiar tune, each time also reminding us how far he’s evolved since then. Cooke doesn’t end up playing the rest of the song, but his howling entreaties make the mere promise of it feel like the entire world. When, right at the brink and without straying from his telephone story, he abruptly pivots into a different number, the 1950s are vanquished and the ’60s have definitively begun.As a civil rights advocate and architect of soul music, alongside Ray Charles, Cooke is a towering figure in American history. After Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination, Rosa Parks comforted herself by listening to Cooke’s “A Change Is Gonna Come,” and its resonance has never waned since, from Barack Obama’s first presidential election victory speech to the funeral of George Floyd. The song has become foundational, and so is Cooke’s artistry as a whole, touching anyone who was ever influenced by soul: Aretha Franklin and Otis Redding on through to Beyoncé and Bruce Springsteen, Sexyy Red and Jonathan Richman, and many more in between.And yet for someone whose legacy has become such a part of the cultural firmament, Cooke remains surprisingly mysterious. As a successful Black singer, songwriter, and businessperson—he co-founded his own label, SAR Records, at a time when that was rare for any artist—Cooke prefigured Prince and Michael Jackson. In 1986, he was one of the first 10 inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, alongside obvious shoo-ins like Elvis Presley. But even then, Rolling Stone misstated both the place and year of Cooke’s birth. Jerry Wexler, the Atlantic executive who coined the term “rhythm and blues,” told The New York Times that Cooke was “the best singer who ever lived,” but not before the same Times critic got Cooke’s home city wrong. Though he died in 1964, Cooke seems to somehow keep winning Grammys, including a lifetime achievement award in 1999, but his discography has hardly been given the retrospective attention of other industry titans from the era. His work is messy and alive, and fraught with existential contradictions.",Pop,10
783,"This deluxe reissue is the holy grail that fans of Tim have dreamt of: a new mix that instantly becomes the best and most definitive album in the Replacements’ catalog. By late 1984, the Replacements were transforming from a shoddy Minneapolis barroom punk band into the biggest prospect in the underground alternative rock scene. They had just released their third album, Let It Be, a title that both paid homage to and took the piss out of the Beatles, which, you could say, basically summed up the Replacements’ whole thing. Whereas the Mats always hated things like parents and school and loved things like beer and getting fucked up, Let It Be offered a wider range of dynamics, tempos, and chord progressions in its nuanced songs about gender, longing, and frustration. (This was amid the joke songs about tonsils and boners.) The perfect “I Will Dare” adopted the jangle-pop shuffle coming out of the UK, the smokey “Androgynous” is glam rock without the stomp, and the spare coda, “Answering Machine,” is a yearning electric folk song, essentially the first solo Paul Westerberg track ever recorded under the banner of the Replacements.Except for rock purist Steve Albini, who loved their snotty lo-fi records but soon found the Replacements “irrevocably lost in the maudlin cabaret of Westerberg’s folk music blatherings,” critics adored Let It Be, ranking it No. 4 in that year’s Village Voice Pazz and Jop poll. It sold well, attracted offers from major labels, and has long been regarded as, if not the best Mats album, then the most authentic Mats album. It was the pivotal moment before they “went pop” and signed to Sire, before unhinged guitarist Bob Stinson was drastically sidelined, before Westerberg took the reins of the Mats and set out to launder the strains of traditional pop through his drunken band of losers. Let It Be was a live wire, the product of four childhood friends who never graduated high school or got driver’s licenses, whose innate talent was matched only by two things: their fear of success and their desire to drown that fear in a case of Schlitz.In comes this essential reissue of the Mats’ fourth album, 1985’s Tim, to trouble the entire narrative. The toast of this box set—which, like Let It Be, also cribs its name from a far more successful album—is an unbelievable new remix of Tim that doesn’t just challenge the notion that Let It Be was the Replacements at their peak, but usurps it to become the best and most definitive album in their catalog. Helmed by famed Ramones engineer Ed Stasium, the remix is jaw-dropping: Gone is Tim’s muddy sound, the tinny reverb on Chris Mars’ drums, and the thin low-end that masked Tommy Stinson’s bass. Every instrument is louder and closer, the mix is much more spread out, Westerberg’s sneakily complicated rhythm playing and chord voicing comes into sharp focus, and there are even a few extra Bob solos. If the previous treatments of Pleased to Meet Me and Don’t Tell a Soul were welcome surprises, this is the holy grail that fans have dreamt of. Finally, no more of the obligatory caveats about production that have plagued the album for almost four decades.",Rock,10
784,"On their riveting new album, the 25-year-old singer-songwriter-producer shifts from future-shocked electronic pop to a super-sized emotional bloodletting steeped in ’90s alternative. When yeule uncorks their roar, it sounds like a full-body exorcism, like they’ve been waiting their entire life to let it out. Wrapped up in grungy angst, hurtling alongside rambunctious cymbal crashes, and shadowed by an exasperation with the empty promises of online life, these screams blare like klaxons on softscars opener “x w x,” signaling ruptures to come. This deck-clearing detonation of a song is prefaced by cascading piano lines tangled up in computerized static, a neat aural distillation of the art-school pop cyborg’s animating inquiry: Now that we’re all hopelessly tethered to technology in search of companionship, comfort, and control, what does it mean to be human? On softscars, their answer can be as annihilating as those shrieks, as playful as an #emovoice TikTok video, or as startling as a notification from a dead friend’s phone.yeule first started toying around with music production as a young teenager in the early 2010s, after they saw a live video of Grimes on the internet and thought, “This fucking bitch does it all by herself… so I’m gonna try.” Over the last few years, the non-binary digital native broke out with a couple of future-shocked electronic pop albums in the mold of Grimes, Charli XCX, and Björk, collecting a cult of Discord and Twitch fans along the way. All the while they mostly sang in a hushed deadpan, wary of letting the real world encroach on their virtual existence. “I like to think I’m doing just fine/I like to search my symptoms online,” goes one memorable lyric from 2022’s Glitch Princess.But on softscars, yeule dives headlong into this thing called humanity, tussling with all of the chaos that comes with it. The album’s title defiantly references old self-harm scars that linger on yeule’s body, tangible reminders of past traumas and what it took to overcome them. And a cloak of reverb is finally lifted from their voice, revealing an expressive range: They can sound winningly whiny or wistful or utterly broken in vocals that are often echoed by pitch-bent doppelgangers, like a chorus of Gollums calling in from a choppy line. They’re also looking to a much different, more retro realm for musical inspiration: alternative rock. The album, largely created by yeule alongside the exciting young producer Kin Leonn, delivers a vintage K-Rock playlist of corroded and gauzy styles, with souped-up dream-pop, emo, electro-folk, pop-punk, and grunge rushing by like fond teenage memories. Meanwhile, the 25 year old at its center continues to explore the infinite spaces between flesh and firmware, fantasy and reality, ones and zeroes.",Pop,8.5
785,"On his first album under his own name, the artist behind Neon Indian returns with the funniest and most musically accomplished songs of his career. For Alan Palomo, the past eight years were an education. In the time since 2015’s VEGA INTL. Night School, his shimmering third LP under the Neon Indian moniker, Palomo felt the need to hone his chops. “I realized I was the least technically adept person in my band,” he recounted in a recent interview with Tone Glow. So he became a more accomplished musician, learning to sight-read and digging deeper into international pop music of the 1980s. He arrives anew on World of Hassle, his first album under his own name. Gone are the submerged vocals and nostalgic haze of his chillwave landmarks like 2009’s Psychic Chasms, and in their place is a clearer facsimile of disco, funk, and boogie: ever-present influences that were once buried in the mix. It’s been a long time since the last Palomo record, yes, but it’s because his vision required serious dedication to realize.Opener “The Wailing Mall” announces a vital touchstone: Leonard Cohen’s I’m Your Man. Across World of Hassle, Palomo writes in a wry, self-aware tone that injects humor into each song, and he occasionally scrapes the lower end of his register for effortlessly cool talk-singing. These tools transform songs like “Nudista Mundial ’89” into convivial party-starters. Finding a goofball compatriot in Mac DeMarco, Palomo describes reveling at a nude beach, folding in cartoonish vocals around a sticky hook. “This ain’t no place/It’s a state of mind,” he sings of their debauchery. Playing the role of hedonistic sleazeball, his commitment to the bit makes the breezy atmosphere irresistible: The dizzying synths and candied falsetto sound like a margarita-infused reverie.In the past, Palomo drenched his vocals in reverb and layers of texture, letting the grooves do the heavy lifting. On World of Hassle, his singing takes center stage alongside his sharpest storytelling to date. On “Big Night of Heartache,” Palomo aims for an economical beachside tearjerker by way of Hiroshi Sato’s 1982 city pop masterpiece Awakening. Amid romantic musical signifiers—seductively bent guitar notes, keyboards that swoop across octaves—he gets unceremoniously dumped, but not without bargaining (“I’ll lose the mustache”). The best city pop can make you feel on top of the world, and Palomo uses its luxurious setting to satirize a manchild in a moment of smallness. “I’m not crying, you’re crying,” he sheepishly retorts to an ex-lover, emasculated and ashamed.World of Hassle is Palomo’s most fun record because it’s his most accomplished. His studied approach is clear on a track like “La Madrileña,” where a loping synth melody bolsters his hypnotic vocal delivery, showcasing his newfound ability to communicate a clear mood. On “Meutrière,” French singer Flore Benguigui’s vocals ooze charm alongside laser-sharp synths, painting a neon-lit noir. World of Hassle abounds with these simple pleasures: The percussive taps in “Stay-at-Home DJ” are delightfully waggish, the saxophone across “Club People” blares with magnetic verve, and the flurrying synths in “The Return of Mickey Milan” accentuate the album’s most memorable chorus. Palomo’s previous albums sounded like the ghosts of ’80s memories. On World of Hassle he offers some unforgettable nights of his own.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

786,"Laetitia Tamko’s bright, dewy electro-pop album depicts growing up with candor and levity. Laetitia Tamko opens her latest album as Vagabon, Sorry I Haven’t Called, as if you're leaving a party right alongside her, finally free to debrief without looking over your shoulders. “Can I talk my shit?” the Cameroon-born, New York-based musician asks in her lilting falsetto, then without waiting for an answer, confesses: “I got way too high for this.” The song is whimsical and vibrant, her conversational words floating over the wistful ahs of an Auto-Tuned choir and bouncy drums. It feels like a reminder that being vulnerable doesn’t have to be scary: It can feel cheeky, bold, and even fun.Tamko emerged from the Brooklyn DIY scene and became part of the new indie-rock vanguard after the release of her debut album, 2017’s Infinite Worlds, a collection of scrappy guitar anthems that felt pensive and ferocious in equal measure. She deviated from that sound on her second album, experimenting with slower, reverb-drowned R&B and indie pop. On Sorry I Haven’t Called, which was co-produced by Rostam, Tamko changes shape once more, resulting in bright and dewy electro-pop songs with more rhythmic dimension. She wrote the album while processing the death of her close friend and collaborator Eric Littmann, expecting to create somber ballads “But when I sat down to write,” she recalled, “I found that I headed more towards catharsis, more towards euphoria, more towards joy.”Honesty, to oneself and to others, is a central theme throughout Sorry I Haven’t Called. On several songs, Tamko measures the growing distance between people, slipping into reveries about the conversations they might have once had: “We find ourselves taking different paths/I see you out and I miss your laugh,” she sings on the wistful ballad “Passing Me By.” On standout “Do Your Worst,” a slice of breakbeat-pop with flute-like trills, Tamko grieves an unhealthy relationship: “You turn me into someone I don’t fuck with/I don’t like myself when I’m with you.” Her subjects can be complicated, but her songs are breezy, inviting the listener to sing along.Sorry I Haven’t Called illustrates a shift in Tamko’s storytelling: She sidesteps diffuse, open-ended imagery for blunt, informal observations. As a writer, Tamko refuses pity, always reflecting on her own role in a dynamic, or searching for a silver lining. This mentality is clearest during the buoyant, Afrobeats-influenced “Carpenter.” “I wasn’t ready to hear you out,” she sings over euphoric shakers and guitar, “but I’m more ready now.” You get the sense of a songwriter shedding her skin, accepting that these inevitable changes will allow her to learn new lessons. On Sorry I Haven’t Called, she depicts the process of growing up with an unflinching heart.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

787,"The alt-country songwriter’s sixth album sits at the eye of the storm, matching a softer, more measured sound with a wryly humorous look at existential turmoil. Is Lydia Loveless, who made their name writing infectious country-rock songs with a death wish—songs about setting an ex’s lawn on fire and getting shot down in a lovers’ spat—mellowing out? “I’m getting older and my jets are starting to cool,” they sing amid squalls of reverb on Nothing’s Gonna Stand in My Way Again, their sixth full-length album. But then, with something between a wink and a sigh, they add, “If I ever get sober it’s really over for you fools.” It is part confession, part boast, part wish, delivered in a croon that holds their vocal power in reserve. Loveless’ earlier albums made deft use of sudden reversals: a flash of vulnerability followed by a sucker punch. Here and throughout their latest and best album, they spend more time in the ambiguous middle.Some of Loveless’ most aggressive music over the past several years has arrived in deceptively shiny packages. On songs like “Heaven” and “Wringer” from their previous two albums, they threw their voice like a hand grenade, thundering lines like “Paradise is only for the weak, man” over twinkling synths and hi-hat pulses. The pessimism roiling beneath these songs transformed their brightness into a deadly coldness: less disco lights than the glint of a scalpel. Nothing’s Gonna Stand in My Way Again paints with a softer palette. Loveless largely sings not from the aftermath but in medias res. In “Toothache,” they feel a low-grade disaster coming on and beg their lover to just “pry it loose,” as a chorus of sugary whoo-hoo-hoos hints at the relief that might follow. The middle of a slowly unfolding crisis can also be eerily calm. “I’ve been looking for a way out,” they confess on the standout “Ghost,” which starts off as one of the most resigned-sounding revenge songs in recent memory, before inverting resignation into relief: “Think that I’ll find it now that I’m stuck in time.”It can be hard to tell the difference between such eye-of-the-hurricane calm and total psychic shutdown. On “Runaway,” over a woozy Mellotron pad, Loveless alternates between cataloging death-drive urges and sketching fragments of scene: “Dissociating down at Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar.” Only a cascading Wurlitzer line, accompanied by a shift into Loveless’ supernaturally resonant upper register, cuts through the murk. There is a stubborn will to transcendence in these songs: a desire to leave the dissociative slough of the eternal middle. But the will-they-won’t-they friction between self-destruction and self-preservation generates its own kind of pleasure. “I want the rush of knowing that I did the right thing for once,” Loveless declares on the power-pop confection “Do the Right Thing,” a song about resolving not to make a confession of love. In “Poor Boy,” a call and response between competing desires—“I wanna get in his head/Don’t wanna fuck with his head”—gathers a giddy energy that carries the song out over waves of pitch-bent synths.",Folk,7.8
788,"Kylie Minogue’s most relaxed album in years is a compendium of all the sounds she’s best known for: confectionary synth-pop, breezy Euro house, and propulsive EDM. Should executives at Mattel follow through with their plans for a full-blown, thousand-year Barbie movie franchise, they might take a page from another enduring icon and star of the summer: Kylie Minogue. The similarities between the Australian pop diva and the American fashion doll have been remarked upon (and played into) for the better half of Minogue’s four-decade career, but apart from the unfailingly sunny demeanor, flamboyant costume changes, and elemental, almost psychedelic blondeness, Minogue has always foregrounded a humanity that no corporate property—never mind most pop stars—could hope to touch. “Self-knowledge is a truly beautiful thing and Kylie knows herself inside out,” Rufus Wainwright once exclaimed to The Guardian, “she is what she is and there is no attempt to make quasi-intellectual statements to substantiate it.” Minogue’s art is surface—fabulously so. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, the singer made pop stardom as compelling a site of projection as Kate Moss was for modeling, collaborating with artists and filmmakers to depict her beauty and blondness through a darkly romantic lens or in campy, theatrical neon. Unlike Janet Jackson or Madonna, who sought to reveal fresh aspects of their psychology with each new release, the fiercely private Minogue has often opted to present herself at face value, even as she’s navigated intense personal upheaval.To read too deeply into the lyrics of a megahit like “Padam Padam” would be an insult, so consider its charm: The single, which defied industry expectations, became an officially sanctioned Pride anthem, sparked dialogue about ageism on UK radio, and dominated the summer off the back of a million TikToks, is a testament to how invigorating and multifaceted the effect of the singer’s music can still be. It is also, taken for parts, a profoundly weird song: the rare hookup banger that manages to shout out Édith Piaf, keep time with your heartbeat, and elicit Pavlovian screams from gay bars in a mere two syllables. “Padam Padam” embodies a looseness of concept that slightly conflicts with the title of Minogue’s 16th album, Tension. It is the most relaxed of her recent LPs and by far the best, a return to form that privileges the emotional immediacy and kinetic sensation that’s defined the best of her music for years.Minogue forayed into concept albums with 2018’s countrified Golden and 2020’s DISCO, which yielded a few undeniable gems but failed overall for the simple reason that they didn’t sound quite like Kylie. In the process of accommodating mirrorballs and cowboy hats, the singer sacrificed a degree of spontaneity, resulting in a self-conscious sound at odds with her self-possessed spirit. After drafting and then ditching plans for an ’80s-inspired album, Minogue and her collaborators—producers Biff Stannard, Duck Blackwell, and Jon Green—abandoned overarching themes in favor of a more casual process, recording with a portable mic setup in Airbnbs and hotel rooms whenever inspiration struck. The final product is a compendium of all the sounds Minogue is best known for: confectionary synth-pop, breezy Euro house, and propulsive EDM.",Pop,7.3
789,"Lil Peep and iLoveMakonnen’s collaborative album reflects the kinship they share as pop outsiders and queer rappers. It’s the rare posthumous rap album that actually honors an artist’s legacy. Posthumous rap releases can sometimes leave a sour taste in the mouth. All too often, they are a last-ditch effort at cashing in on an artist's legacy. In the first two years after Lil Peep’s tragic death, his label released several collaborations that felt stitched-together, even designed for commercial appeal: “Falling Down,” a song Peep recorded before his passing, got an unfinished verse from XXXTentacion, recorded prior to his own death in 2018. Meanwhile, some try-hard bars from Fall Out Boy’s Patrick Stump were awkwardly inserted into “I’ve Been Waiting,” a previously unreleased iLoveMakonnen and Peep collaboration. Since then, Lil Peep’s estate has taken a more sensitive and legacy-minded approach. The focus is now on remastering Peep’s archives and clearing unlicensed samples in his work, instead of constructing new music from the incomplete remains of his recordings.Both “Falling Down” and “I’ve Been Waiting” originated during Peep’s 2017 sessions in London with Makonnen, which have circulated for several years in bootleg form and now appear in full on the joint album DIAMONDS. According to Peep’s estate, DIAMONDS represents the last “cohesive full body of work” produced by the artist in his lifetime, but it’s also not entirely finished—while many of these songs might sound complete, it’s hard to know whether or not Peep would have kept tweaking with them had he lived, so Gothboiclique producers Fish Narc and Smokeasac, regular Peep collaborators, made a deliberate choice to simply remaster the project rather than add to it. DIAMONDS is not exactly a rough draft, but there’s a sense of looseness that suggests it hasn’t been aggressively curated. The 81-minute runtime is significantly longer than most projects Peep or Makonnen have ever released, resembling a folder of demos more than the tight pop album it might have been.Makonnen facilitated and approved the tacked-on features from both XXXTentacion and Stump yet those guest appearances feel indicative of how the Atlanta rapper has too often been shut out of hip-hop’s mainstream, in part because of his queerness; it wasn’t enough for the music to stand on its own, there had to be a bigger name attached. DIAMONDS is lightly buffed but largely unpolished, a form that not only preserves the artistic kinship between Makonnen and Peep as pop outsiders, but the queer sensitivity that their work shares. Several months prior to his passing, Peep came out on social media as bisexual, and the pronouns that both he and Makonnen use to refer to their lovers vary throughout the album. Though the two may have inhabited slightly different lanes of rap, they both knew how it felt to be queer men in a frequently hostile industry, and that common experience of identity is part of what drew them together. In an interview with Grammy.com, Makonnen stated that Peep specifically wanted to team up because he felt that a collaborative album from two openly queer hip-hop artists could be a balm to listeners. “[Peep] said, ‘I feel like we can really make a change in the world by showing this because so many of us young fans and young people are dealing with all types of things,’” recalled Makonnen.",Rap,7.4
790,"The Bronx rapper’s bluntness and playful ear for beats gives his sex-obsessed songs the nonchalance of a one-night stand. At this point, calling Bronx rapper-producer Cash Cobain’s music “filthy” is like calling hot sauce “spicy”: a technically correct observation that doesn’t begin to describe what it’s doing to your nerve receptors. Though he’s a pioneer of the sample and sexy drill movements that have subsequently merged with the jerky rhythms of club rap, the main topic in most of his songs is sex—having it, pursuing it, starting and ending relationships over it. Still, there’s a care and humor to his craft that makes his debauchery endearing instead of creepy. Like Pusha T with cocaine or Action Bronson with food, he’s a specialist using his skills to wax poetic on his favorite subject in every way possible (“She told me to cum inside like a visit,” he says on “Slizzy Dialogue”). And while he isn’t quite as outlandish as fellow sex-obsessed rappers like SahBabii, his bluntness and playful ear for beats gives each song the nonchalance of a one-night stand.Pretty Girls Love Slizzy, his sixth album, doesn’t skimp on the sex talk, but for all the silly puns (“I wanna drink on that shit like a Mistic/Name her pussy Jada ’cause I kissed it”), DM slides, and Hennessy-soaked hookups, his never-ending quest to get laid has a romantic drive. Take the frantic “Slizzy Dialogue,” a point-by-point retelling of a short-lived affair—from first contact to steamy linkup—that ends with a postcoital phone call from his lover’s boyfriend. Over warbling synths and fast-clacking drums, the song flows with the hectic energy of an impromptu FaceTime convo, complete with exasperated ad-libs and he-said-she-said qualifiers. Later, on “Clocking U” and “Took a While,” he’s begging for action like a bizarro version of Don Toliver, affectionately telling a woman he misses her before asking her to “blow me like some tissue.” Many rappers could make this request sound uncomfortable, but it helps that Cobain doesn’t take himself too seriously. His unfussed delivery keeps things moving like a breezy romantic comedy.Aside from his comically large libido, Cobain has a striking ear for beats. His blend of sample drill and Jersey club has many imitators, but none have reached the dizzying heights of his and Chow Lee’s 2022 mixtape 2 Slizzy 2 Sexy, which flipped everything from the Plain White T’s to Trinidad Cardona into singular audio candy. A handful of Pretty Girls’ beats re-up that formula: The flip of Jai Paul’s gossamer “BTSTU” that powers lead single “Rump” dovetails nicely with the thumping club drums at its margins. It pairs well with “Not No Xanax 2,” which reimagines Nelly and Kelly Rowland’s “Dilemma” hook as a chiptune-esque party jam. But what really elevates Pretty Girls is Cobain’s ability to branch out beyond club and drill without overextending himself. “So Fire” scales back the BPM, using heavy reverb and dubby dancehall drums to create a humid sway. On “Nice N Slow,” the talkbox vocals, rapid-fire drums, and twinkling synths call to mind a drill flip of Chromeo. That sense of adventure has always been present in Cobain’s music—this is a guy who’s unafraid to dig into the Spice Girls and Ray Charles catalogs for material—so it’s nice to hear him try out different tunes.The challenge of being a rapper with hyper-specific subject matter is finding ways to keep it fresh, but Cash Cobain has yet to disappoint. His music isn’t sexy just because he’s unabashedly horny, and it isn’t entertaining just because he has immaculate taste in samples. It works because you can feel the fun behind it. There’s a life-affirming buzz behind the simple elegance of Cobain and New Jersey producer McVertt’s starry beat on “Messy,” or the glowing way he asks, “Can I hit it in the back of the Caddy?”—moments worthy of kicking off block parties and echoing from car stereos at stoplights. Cash Cobain bottles that essence and sprays it on tracks like cologne.",Rap,7.4
791,"For the first time ever, the Southern metal expats return with the same lineup as their previous album. A little outside input could’ve gone a long way. The only essential moment on Stone, the sixth album by beloved metal transmogrifiers Baroness, arrives just four minutes after the record begins and lasts only 30 seconds. As the band reaches the end of the chugging chorus that anchors “Last Word,” its newest member, Gina Gleason, rushes ahead, her guitar line swiveling like some snaky Chuck Berry lead that coils so tightly it snaps, leaving her to reassemble the pieces in a rush of squealing notes. It is a perfect guitar solo, a thrill ride so disorientating you’re left to wonder where you are not just in the song but in the world.Gleason’s paroxysm complete, Baroness retreat into a haze of tremolo guitars, reorienting themselves until they can return to the tune’s main premise—that is, a plodding and byzantine reflection on mortality that suggests the Foo Fighters for a particularly bookish biker gang. Neither “Last Word” nor Stone ever returns to the ecstatic heights of Gleason’s shuddering solo. By record’s end, you may wonder if Baroness can reach them at all.Baroness emerged in the mid-’00s as perhaps the most exciting and versatile band in a teeming renaissance of Southern metal. Leader John Baizley paired his strong-jawed stentorian bark with an unfailing sense of melody and real compositional ambition—think the Allman Brothers Band, Pink Floyd, and even Genesis, strained through the malevolence of swampy Southern forebears like Eyehategod. Even as the lineup often shifted, they made stepwise career moves, signing to genre bastion Relapse for a series of stunning records. After a devastating 2012 bus crash splintered the lineup, Baroness regrouped, launched their own label, and pursued slightly more commercial impulses, meting out eccentricity inside wildly accessible songs. “Shock Me,” the Grammy-nominated powerhouse from 2015’s Purple, should still be a radio staple, as should “Tourniquet,” from 2019’s Gold & Grey. At multiple points during the last 15 years, Baroness seemed on the verge of becoming a very big rock band.But Baroness decided to downsize for Stone, their first album in four years, converting an Airbnb along the mountainous edge of Pennsylvania and New York into a studio where they could do everything themselves. This marked the first time that the same group of musicians who recorded the prior Baroness album reconvened to make the next one. Stone, however, begs for an outsider’s input, for someone to have said, “No, that’s not it.” So much of Stone feels like stitched-together composites of what has worked well in the past. Momentum is often squandered, and the electrifying bits rarely rise into something more.",Metal,6.2
792,"The New Hampshire DJ folds multiple influences—trance, drum’n’bass, breaks, acid, deep house—into shape-shifting tracks that mimic the flow of an ecstatic night of dancing. Maya Bouldry-Morrison sees music as a curative force, for both her audience and herself. “I deal with depression and anxiety,” she said in a recent interview, “but when I get out on the decks, I want to translate to the crowd why music is a healing technology. I'm not always successful, but I do it because I need to hear it first.” In the past, her therapeutic missives have taken the form of exuberant vocal samples. In live shows and earlier releases, her messages often came across in chopped-up monosyllables and joyful exclamations. More recently, she’s taken a leisurely, but no less reverential, approach: 2021’s She’s Calling EP ended with a winding meditation beckoning the listener to the woods. On her latest EP, Dreams of a Dancefloor, Bouldry-Morrison—better known as Octo Octa—imparts her dancefloor revelations largely without words, carefully building layered narratives from basslines and breakbeats.Opener “Late Night Love” is an acid-house opera tracing a rowdy night out into the bleary-eyed bliss of a post-club cuddle puddle. The song starts with a buoyant synth tapping out a fervent rhythm, a hypnotic transmission that sounds like Gershon Kingsley’s “Popcorn” ushering you to the rave. Echoes of a breakbeat shuffle in the background, suggesting the feverish energy thrumming from inside the club as you wait in the line to enter. After an extended stretch of growing anticipation, the kick drum drops, beckoning toward the sweaty dancefloor. But just as sprightly synths and layers of percussion begin to coalesce, the melody drops out, leaving just a wiry, acid-laced lead and the beating heart of the bass drum. It sounds like the eye of the storm at the center of a long night, the moment when bodies meet and the rest of the world falls away.An adept student of trance music’s intricately building energy, Octo Octa layers synths so deliberately that the song has gradually envelops you. But unlike traditional trance, she also adds in flavors from her own musical history—drum’n’bass, house—that create episodic, almost prog-like chapters in her songs. The 12-minute “Late Night Love” is among the producer’s longest tracks, but by the end—as syncopated piano washes the scene in sunrise hues, and the night becomes morning—it’s hard not to want to remain in her dream world, keeping the party rolling into the next evening.Within Octo Octa’s healing framework, certain rhythms impart particular benefits: Drum’n’bass is her “body music,” while her heart is more connected to house. By that logic, the shuffling beats of “Let Yourself Go!” snap the listener back into the corporeal realm after the long metaphysical limbo of “Late Night Love.” While Orbital-esque synths in the background rise and fall like crashing waves, Octo Octa darts between wobbly basslines and pitched-up diva vocals. With each pivot between the two sounds, the breaks seem to pick up momentum. By the time the percussion fades out in the last minute of the song, it’s almost as if the synths have taken flight, launching from a running start into the stratosphere.",Electronic,7.5
793,"The pseudonymous London producer’s new album is a radiant, elastic, nearly four-hour celebration of the transportive possibilities of dance music. Somewhere between a brain massage and a 1990s basement rave, a memory and a dream, lies the curious and sparkling realm of DJ Sabrina the Teenage DJ. Since her 2017 debut Makin’ Magick, the prolific, pseudonymous London producer (who sometimes works with a collaborator, Salem) has built out a world of lush deep house that interweaves disco, synth funk, and Radio Disney pop with breakbeats, dialogue samples, and power-ballad vocals. At nearly four hours long, her new album Destiny is her most intricate project yet, a radiant and elastic celebration of the transportive possibilities of dance music.DJ Sabrina’s name and much of her cheeky 64-bit promotional imagery draw from the comic-book-turned-’90s-sitcom Sabrina the Teenage Witch, which followed 16-year-old Sabrina Spellman’s earnest attempts to balance life as a powerful sorceress and a Britney Spears-loving high schooler. DJ Sabrina chose her namesake because she felt it conveyed a certain melancholy aesthetic, like a “warped TV movie that makes you cry in a way no mainstream movie would be able to,” she explained to Bandcamp in 2021. Her 2020 album, Charmed, won over pandemic-weary online fans, some of whom swore that Sabrina’s music had eased their depression. Porter Robinson, the similarly pop-minded American producer, started spinning her tracks between sets. In 2022, a demo that she’d sent to the 1975 became the basis for the band’s song “Happiness.”Since then, Sabrina has remained semi-anonymous and cooking. She dropped two albums on the same day in 2021: the darker, more industrial The Other Realm, and a sequel to Makin’ Magick. 2022’s Bewitched, which sounds crafted by a plucky teen cyborg, further established her signature sound. Instead of taking wider attention as a cue to package her output for ease of mass consumption, Sabrina has pushed its limits: Why not dabble in witch house while also taking inspiration from The Marshall Mathers LP 2? Why not rerelease each new project in a “singles” edition—which presents individual tracks rather than a continuous mix—and encourage fans to exploit the structural and stylistic flexibility of playlisting?That eagerness to experiment with form is abundantly evident in the vast medley of genres Sabrina incorporates into Destiny: smooth jazz, 2010s EDM, country, crunk. Standout “Invincible (Something to Hold on To)” blends clanging synths and vocoder samples into a dreamy, menacing club thumper that brings an electric tingle to Destiny’s sometimes impenetrable-seeming digital sheen. You like “In the Air Tonight”? Sabrina does too, and proudly alerts us by letting loose a waterfall of Phil Collins-inspired drums near the end of “Vibrations.” Even the bouncy rock-rap on “For Now and Forever” works, indicating the generous breadth of Sabrina’s internal playlist of raw material. In her universe, Prince and Barenaked Ladies are both permitted to rock.",Pop,7.9
794,"The New York nightlife veteran’s new album chronicles pandemic survival in the city and the difficult joy that’s followed. When was the last time New York dance music was “hot”? Some would probably argue the answer lies in the culture’s initial Brooklynification in the early 2000s, as chronicled on the margins of Lizzie Goodman’s Meet in the Bathroom. Older heads might cite the decade leading up to 9/11 when local rhythm undergrounds, hip-hop and house, became world conquerors. Historically minded utopians often argue the city is always popping, a kernel of truth held onto most tightly by romantic transplants.When you come of age in New York club culture, as Eli Escobar has, you recognize how connected its ups and downs are to the state of the city. By that measure, everything great happening in those clubs right now (hint: a lot) takes place in the shadow of 2020: the pandemic, the protests, the failed civic response, the officially shuttered nightlife and its roar back to life. All this turmoil is at the heart of Escobar’s The Beach Album, which got its title because the forty-something New Yorker recorded it in a house on the city’s Ramones-immortalized Rockaway Beach, where he and his family spent lockdown. Here is not only the period’s trauma, but the deeply complicated joy taking place afterwards.An Upper West Side kid who began playing records, throwing parties, and making beats as a late-’80s/early-’90s teen, Escobar has been a presence across the city’s clubbing spectrum ever since. His career began in the dusk of hip-hop’s golden age and hit professional cruise while he paid his dues as an all-night-selecting worker bee during Manhattan’s bottle service days and blog-house phase. Now Escobar is one of the city’s most popular and hardworking DJs, sidestepping the festival and global circuit to gig locally several times a week: playing specialty big-room house or techno at queer party nights, street-soul and classic hip-hop on hotel rooftops, or a signature ’80s-heavy “sad boy electro” at Bushwick dives. At Tiki Disco, the decade-long outdoor summer institution he throws with DJ Lloyd and Andy Pry, the sound is an endless string of iconic dance tracks for packed Sunday afternoon crowds. The selections are egalitarian, the crowd-reading is precise, and the layered mixing superlative.Escobar brings this sociological awareness and cultural fluency to The Beach, the latest and best in a series of sample-heavy mixtapes he produced during a creative burst early in the pandemic. 2020’s There Are Ghosts Everywhere in New York City grafted soul music onto community monologues and throwback interviews with neighborhood residents, while 2021’s Lullabies for a Sleeping City was a downtempo beat-tape on the theme of quiet urbanity and resilience. Though dancefloors were shuttered at those times, Escobar never stopped making songs for movement and release: grimy funk-house loops, pop-techno compositions, modular synth experiments. What ties The Beach together is how its tracks—which in Escobar’s eclectic style runs the gamut from hip-hop interludes to epic Balearic fantasias—accept the weight of the pandemic without getting swallowed by it, the context deepening the grooves. Another generation’s death disco—or, more precisely, Midtown 120 Blues—comes into view.",Electronic,7.8
795,"The Toronto death metal band returns with its best album yet: an ambitious and deeply human suite that touches the sublime. The first 10 minutes of Tomb Mold’s triumphant The Enduring Spirit make it obvious why they’re one of the most beloved death metal bands of the past decade. The Toronto trio emerged in 2015 amid the same death metal wave that launched old-school revivalists Gatecreeper and outer-space voyagers Blood Incantation, and their sound fell somewhere in the middle: brutal enough to satisfy the base urges of the death-metal lizard brain, but with a heady virtuosity that gestured toward the cosmos. They were also prolific, releasing three records in three consecutive years, climaxing with 2019’s stellar Planetary Clairvoyance. In the years since, the band has mostly been on ice, so it’s a thrill to press play on The Enduring Spirit and hear them roaring back to life, showing off the same tangled riffs, nimble drums, and inhuman growls they perfected across their first three records.As great as “The Perfect Memory (Phantasm of Aura)” and “Angelic Fabrications” are, those first two tracks serve as a canny bit of misdirection. The third track, “Will of Whispers,” kicks off with a drum fill from drummer/vocalist Max Klebanoff then drops into a gentle, open-hearted chord, ringing out over a wordless vocal from Klebanoff that sounds more like a yogic om than his typical growl. For the next 40 seconds, guitarists Derrick Vella and Payson Power exchange flickering jazz licks and clean, echoey progressions, while Vella’s freewheeling bass roams the open spaces. Only after this sunlit reverie does the heavy riff come in, ferrying the song through a whirring fantasia of muscular death metal and dreamy atmospherics. For the rest of the album, Tomb Mold play fast and loose with the boundaries between death metal and their myriad other interests—jazz fusion,’70s prog, 4AD-style dream-pop. But crucially, they never sound bored with death metal. However far afield their explorations take them, they remain enthralled by the genre’s awesome potential.There are precursors to their approach. Death, by many measures the very first death metal band, quickly made their way from the malformed thrash of Scream Bloody Gore to something far stranger. (With screechier vocals, Spirit highlight “Servants of Possibility” could be a Symbolic outtake.) Atheist’s mutant prog-death looms large here, and the gonzo weirdness of Demilich and the cavernous doom-death of Incantation still lurk in the corners. But the classic band Tomb Mold most resembles at this point is Cynic, whose synth-and-vocoder-heavy sound and fixation on Zen Buddhism made them one of death metal’s most glorious oddities in the early ’90s. Like Cynic, Tomb Mold are seekers, fascinated by metal’s transcendental potential as much as its flesh-and-blood physicality. On The Enduring Spirit, they frequently sound ecstatic, as though they’re a riff away from discovering the music of the spheres. Trollish black metal kids in Scandinavia used to take the piss out of death metal bands by calling their music “life metal.” For Tomb Mold, that epithet would likely come as a compliment.",Metal,8.6
796,"The Spanish artist’s debut cuts and pastes from R&B, hip-hop, reggaeton, and flamenco. It’s bizarre and incongruous—but oddly satisfying. On his debut album, Ralphie Choo, a former chemical engineering student, toys with genres with radical abandon, manipulating sounds like reagents and catalysts in a lab. Across 14 tracks, fluttering flutes, dembow riddims, and flamenco palmas bubble up in a frothy but precisely measured concoction. Ad-libs punctuate the beats like exclamation points. Vocals arrive through aggressive, jagged filters. Everything is glitchy and meandering, gesturing toward familiar genres but never fully surrendering to them. Choo’s music champions fragmented pop maximalism, illustrating what’s possible when you catapult centuries-old traditions into a globalized present. Within the landscape of Spanish-language pop, currently oversaturated with cookie-cutter reggaeton, this freaky confluence of past and present is a welcome respite.His music may bring to mind other contemporary Spanish pop conceptualists, like fellow madrileño C. Tangana and Rosalía, who slide folk styles like copla and flamenco alongside synth stabs and 808 kicks. Choo’s approach is similarly exploratory and deranged, perhaps even more interested in shredding ancestral practices to pieces. His friends are influences too: Alongside rusowsky, mori, Tristán, and Drummie, Choo is part of the Madrid-based label and collective rusia idk. Their plush R&B and slanted club concoctions exemplify the experimental sounds coming out of the Spanish capital—and Choo is one of the crew’s most gifted international delegates.Choo is first and foremost a producer, and a masterful worldbuilder. “Juan Salvador Gaviota” threads a bossa nova groove into “NHF,” an aspirated, shimmering R&B tune that stutters into a jungle breakdown. “Total90sNostalgia” radiates a wistful pink glow, like a climactic scene in a coming-of-age film. The piano interlude “Bò” is lissome and pure, even as a cartoonish, helium-infused voice mumbles unintelligibly in the background. These songs melt into a blissful and immersive fog, as if suspended between states of consciousness. It’s just one example of the border-soft magic that Choo conjures in his songs.Supernova soars when it strips flamenco down to its percussive core, like on “Tangos de Una Moto Trucada,” which is grounded in a palo built out of wooden spoons, knives, and salt shakers and punctured by jarring piano notes. Revving engines and palmas, the hand claps of flamenco, form the foundation of “Bulerías de un Caballo Malo,” but Choo adds cherubic harp plucking, like a banger designed for the kingdom of heaven. The Mura Masa collaboration “Máquina Culona,” which collages brain-scrambling static punches, digital accordions, and clacking palmas, feels like a sudden bout of air turbulence, an exhilarating jolt on an otherwise smooth flight. In the video, a shirtless man cooks a slab of raw meat with a clothing iron, another lights a cigarette in a lobster’s claw, and a third slurps up a bowl of soup wearing a toilet seat around his neck like jewelry. This onslaught of bizarre, incongruous images is oddly satisfying—much like Supernova itself.",Experimental,7.7
797,"The free jazz collective takes a more patient and self-reflective approach to politics on their new album. Irreversible Entanglements is a band built on improvisation, five jazz virtuosos—poet/vocalist Camae Ayewa (aka Moor Mother), bassist Luke Stewart, trumpeter Aquiles Navarro, saxophonist Keir Neuringer, and drummer Tcheser Holmes—coalescing around an idea and discovering where it takes them. Their live shows are typically presented as a single piece of music, one movement seamlessly evolving into the next as they explore their anti-colonial and anti-fascist politics through sound. Their albums so far have mirrored this approach. After bonding during a Musicians Against Police Brutality event, they recorded their self-titled 2017 debut in a single day in Brooklyn, their first time performing as a collective.Their fourth album, Protect Your Light, represents a departure from this free-flowing process. Recording across several days, the ensemble leaned into the tools of the studio, reexamining material and layering overdubs with help from multi-instrumentalist Shahzad Ismaily. The list of production credits dwarfs the lyrics sheet; each member wields multiple instruments, producing an album that sounds bigger than the five-piece group that created it. Cymbals crash, saxophones scream, horns swirl, and basslines walk confidently before tumbling down the stairs. But the chaos is controlled. The songs are relatively concise for Irreversible Entanglements, with the longest one clocking in at seven and a half minutes.Their early work was often confrontational, demanding engagement with uncomfortable topics such as systemic racism, gentrification, and the struggle to preserve community in spite of these forces. On “Land Back,” they continue to evoke anti-colonial struggles around the world and challenge the West’s self-appointed role at the center of geopolitics: “In Ethiopia, in Nigeria, in the so-called Middle East/Who knows what happened?” But for the most part, Protect Your Light takes a more patient and self-reflective approach, vibrating on a different frequency. It’s the act of refilling one’s vessel in song form.That process begins, of course, with love: love for one’s self, neighbors, and family. “Free love/That lives in you,” Ayewa begins on the album’s opener, the start of a poem that ruminates on the bi-directional nature of love. Her voice is airy and drenched in reverb, radiating into the atmosphere as the drums roll along with her. Then the cymbals fade, the bass struts in, and the drum kit pulls you back down to earth. “root<=>branch” pays tribute to the late trumpeter jaimie branch, former labelmate and friend. “We can get free/Free from the pain/Free from the struggle/Let’s get free,” Ayewa pleads, as a layer of synthesized static crescendos to a high-pitched squeal. In the song’s second half, the horns and sax dance and scat joyfully, but by the sixth minute they seem to cry out in pain.This is Irreversible Entanglements’ first album for storied jazz label Impulse!, home to greats like John Coltrane, Archie Shepp, and Pharoah Sanders. To record it, the band set up shop at Rudy Van Gelder Studios in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, a historic space inhabited by the ghosts of jazz giants. And though the studio is not referenced specifically, its spiritual energy seems to carry through the album. On “Soundness,” Ayewa beckons us inside (“You are safe here/In the room”) and lets fluttering horns and reeds wash over us, connecting the practice of prayer to the safety of the spaces in which it is conducted. These are the places where the energy of the universe is concentrated, cultivated, and protected: the places where music is made.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

798,"With flutes and instrumental flair, the New Zealand singer-songwriter adds restless drama to her steadfast, plainspoken reflections on pain and personal growth. Here’s the annoying thing about creating anything: You have to reckon with a time lag. Pure feeling can never survive the time required to decide to register it, and then jot it down. So you have to invent the thought anew, render it writerly, symbolic, neat. New Zealand musician Sarah Mary Chadwick, whose work has always privileged immediacy and primacy, brings pause and contemplation to her eighth studio album, Messages to God. In a quavering contralto thick with indeterminacy, she mirrors the experience of trying to clamber out of the darkness, but never knowing when it will end, or whether the light at the end of the tunnel exists at all.Her previous three albums, released between 2019 and 2021, found solid footing (and a bleak sense of humor) in abjection, referencing heavy drinking, self-harm, her own suicide attempt. Lines tended to end in an anti-climax or a joke, alongside a streak of cruelty. “Tried to end it all, I’d not tried lately/August 11, 2019/And I didn’t call my mum/’Cause I hate that bitch,” she sung on 2021’s “Me and Ennui Are Friends, Baby.” The effect was one of emotional overstimulation rather than purgation.Messages to God documents Chadwick’s attempt to find help and health, a process that’s boring and often irritating, like a slow, dull scratch. During the effort to move forward, she often falls back into her past, landing on heartbreak and hopeless nostalgia loops. But there are flashes of scattered beauty, lightning bolts of pure joy. “Well I’m here/I’m glad I’m still alive,” she sings like a secret on “I Felt Things in New Zealand,” a pause from her carousing vocal performance. At times Chadwick herself becomes a reliable and loving guide. On “Drinkin’ on a Tuesday,” a rollicking, boozy anthem, she proffers some genuinely great advice: “You gotta have a song to sing that will bring you to its knees with its beauty/And you gotta have a joke to tell that’ll help you make friends drinking on a Tuesday.”In her previous triptych of albums, musical gestures were largely deprioritized in favor of Chadwick’s dramatic vocal delivery. Melodies were few and far between, as well as tonally inconsistent. She played her piano like a teenager throwing a tantrum during a school recital, bashing out a few chords here and there, keeping the composition as spare as possible, yet still furiously alive. She used her limited technical ability in service of her emotionally excessive performance. Here, pop melodies serve as a foil to Chadwick’s grave messages. A grand piano line, reminiscent of Aphrodite Child’s “Spring, Summer, Winter and Fall,” meets bluegrass slide guitar on “Don’t Tell Me I’m a Good Friend”; a psychedelic swirl of flutes surrounds her voice on “Only Bad Memories Last.” These flitting, willfully frivolous additions bring further drama and tension to Chadwick’s songcraft. The depression and abjection that once characterized her songs made them purgatorial, motiveless. Now, Chadwick floods them with wild and frenzied motive-seeking, performing the quest for lightness and reason with equal ferality.",Folk,7.5
799,"The National’s second album of 2023 extends its predecessor’s subdued mood and reclusive purview. R.E.M. had been a band for 24 years when they released their worst album, 2004’s Around the Sun, a record that magnified that aging act’s growing weaknesses and succumbed to sheer tedium. The National, perhaps not coincidentally, were also marking 24 years together when they released First Two Pages of Frankenstein in April this year. While not as disastrously dull as Around the Sun, that record dragged in similar ways. Both albums over-relied on programmed drums, and both gambled on the misguided hope that studio refinement might prove a fair substitute for live energy. It’s hard to imagine many Taylor Swift fans introduced to the National through her feature on Frankenstein became converts.R.E.M. responded to their misfire by taking a few years to recalibrate and returning with a rock record. The National have taken the opposite approach. Just five months after Frankenstein, they’ve released a companion album, Laugh Track, featuring material written alongside its predecessor. True to its mirrored cover art, Laugh Track plays largely like The Next Two Pages of Frankenstein, continuing its predecessor’s subdued mood and reclusive purview, with singer Matt Berninger further chronicling depressive withdrawal and deteriorating relationships (“Friendships are melting/Nothing is helping,” he despairs). That may disappoint fans hoping that the muted reception to Frankenstein might inspire the band to shake things up, but Laugh Track does fine-tune its predecessor’s approach, albeit subtly. The band recorded most of it after Frankenstein, using their tour behind that album to road test and refine the stray ideas from its writing sessions, so the execution is slightly tweaked, less rigid, more freeform.Most noticeably, drummer Bryan Devendorf returns to a real kit after Frankenstein primarily relegated him to machines. That’s a huge upgrade: Devendorf’s drumming has long been the 5-Hour Energy shot that keeps this band from drifting into slumber. Even though he’s rarely granted much volume to play with, he packs drama into even some of the record’s slowest songs; you can hear where the applause is supposed to go. His fidgety, racing percussion introduces intrigue to the otherwise staid “Turn Off the House,” and he propels “Space Invader” toward the kind of cathartic outro this band used to throw down all the time but now reserves only for the rare nights when the sitters are free and nobody has work the next morning.As has become the norm on National albums, there are some guests. Phoebe Bridgers returns on the title track, a sweet little song about looking on the extremely relative bright side, and Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon shadows Berninger on “Weird Goodbyes,” the string-kissed 2022 single conspicuously left off of Frankenstein. Big names, both, but they’re basically accompanists; their voices may be on these songs but their fingerprints are not. That’s not the case with Rosanne Cash, who plays Lady Gaga to Berninger’s Bradley Cooper on the late-album standout “Crumble.” It’s the rare late-period National song you can imagine somebody other than Berninger crushing at karaoke.",Rock,6.8
800,"The reggae veteran’s new studio album doesn’t match the magic of his legacy. But when he’s not exploring grandiose thematic statements, he sounds as confident and impressive as ever. Though released to relatively muted fanfare, Born for Greatness, the new studio album from veteran reggae star Buju Banton, still arrives with great expectations attached. Banton was already the first artist to break Bob Marley’s record for No. 1 singles in Jamaica by 1995, when he released ’Til Shiloh—arguably the greatest full-length statement of the era in which dancehall dominated the Jamaican charts. That LP represented roughly what Illmatic did for East Coast rap or Voodoo for neo-soul—an artistic peak which simultaneously signaled a sea change for an entire genre. It is also like those records in the sense that Buju has been shadowboxing with its legacy ever since, producing a deep catalog of classic compositions, but never quite achieving an album that rivaled its coherence or power.The opening moments of Born for Greatness—strummed acoustic guitar and an eerily echoed and sped-up vocal sample, anchored by a simple knocking beat—are a departure from Buju’s last outing, Upside Down 2020. That album contained a number of compelling songs, but it was almost as if he jumped erratically between styles and decades, attempting, perhaps, to make up for the time lost during his extended incarceration in the U.S. on highly questionable drug charges. In some ways, BFG’s spare, haunting beginning marks a return to the ’90s sound of ’Til Shiloh, which is a good thing: The skeletal beat provides the perfect bed for Buju’s gruff baritone, famously the most gravelly in a genre wherein booming, bassy vocals are a form of combat. Here, the recently returned Buju measures up admirably against his younger self.The “missing” years of Buju’s imprisonment are the grist for “Ageless Time,” the first cut on Born for Greatness. It raises themes that reverberate throughout the rest of the album: the self-examination and doubt that arise from isolation, the powerlessness felt in the face of passing time. The articulation of these feelings will resonate with many listeners’ experiences of the pandemic, though the lyrics here and on “Yard and Outta Road” ground them in Buju’s humbling fall from grace during his trial and conviction in Florida. “Ageless Time” feels like a declaration that this album will wrestle with bigger demons than other recent work, and it’s also a formidable vocal performance. Buju chants seamlessly through the rhythm, moving between both raspy exhalations and unaspirated downdrafts, like the soundclash equivalent of circular breathing. The song was co-written by Stephen Marley, a longtime ally of Buju’s, and Marley’s unmistakable touch appears in its melodic lines and delivery, which function as a natural complement to Buju’s style.",Pop,6.7
801,"In diaphanous compositions like color field paintings, this full-band ambient album conveys relaxation, whimsy, and a vague sense of dread. Piotr Kurek’s Smartwoods comes on gradually, then all at once. An electric guitar plucks out a tentative phrase; a harp responds with unhurried plucks; metallic taps, like steel pans, add shading. Finally, an acoustic bass draws a thick, smudgy line on the ground, while harmonized woodwinds breathe the rest of the picture into being. The stereo field fills in the way that pavement darkens, drop by drop, in the opening moments of a light rain. But here, instead of mottled asphalt, we’re presented with a sumptuous wash of color, a soft pointillism of rich pastels. Over the next 36 minutes, Kurek and his players extend that approach across seven alluringly splotchy tracks that aspire to the condition of abstract painting.Kurek’s last album, Peach Blossom—released just this past April—was a very different affair. There, the Warsaw-based composer focused his attention on the disorienting effects of Auto-Tune and an unsteady mix of acoustic and resolutely digital timbres. Smartwoods’ palette, in contrast, is largely acoustic, emphasizing Anna Pašic’s harp, Tomasz Duda’s woodwinds, and Wojtek Traczyk’s double bass. But the longer you spend inside this odd, diaphanous landscape, the more you may come to suspect that its seeming naturalism is an illusion. Listen carefully, and the album is awash in alien squiggles.Unassuming instrumental timbres occasionally wobble in place as though flicked by a fingertip. A minute into the first track, a pitch-shifted twinge of harp sounds like a cartoon projectile ricocheting off a bouncy castle; later in the same song, a vocoded swoosh shimmers and extinguishes like a hologram. Halfway through the album, there’s a splash of synthesizer that we haven’t heard before and won’t hear again. All of these moments display Kurek’s signature knack for defamiliarizing the conventional—and making the unfamiliar feel like second nature.Occasionally, what sounds like a human voice murmurs a single, wordless syllable and falls silent again, as though clearing the throat for an utterance that never comes. Like the synthesized glissando that periodically plunges across King Sunny Adé’s Juju Music, these flashes of otherness are fleeting; they feel like tiny, temporary portals to another world.Smartwoods’ broad, slightly ragtag swatches of color—reminiscent of Richard Diebenkorn, perhaps, or Helen Frankenthaler—are loose in form and ambiguous in mood. Songs can feel playful, even naive; their moderate tempos and hazy palette, frequently carried by flute or clarinet, have a relaxed, bucolic air. Yet these whimsical worlds, like those of fairy tales, are shadowed by a vaguely ominous undercurrent. There are hints of disturbance beneath the placid surface, as the music is tugged ceaselessly between consonance and dissonance. There’s a weird contradiction at play: You may find yourself wondering why, given the music’s sunset hues and dandelion-tuft drift, you feel so unsettled.",Experimental,7.5
802,"The Singaporean band’s new album showcases a punchier indie rock sound and reinvigorated perspective on the environment. On their third album, Nature of Things, the Singaporean quintet Subsonic Eye pivoted from their usual wide-eyed dream pop to a raw, earthier sound. Nature was frenetic yet loose, mixing the shaggy indie rock of Life Without Buildings and Pavement with snappy vocal melodies, frisky math-rock rhythms, and buzzy emo riffs. But while the band may have sounded vibrant, their outlook seemed downcast. Witnessing the destructive effects of urbanization had left them feeling cynical, even as they were making a conscious effort to explore the environment. They ended the album with a defeated sigh, the natural world slipping from their grasp.Subsonic Eye’s latest album, All Around You, takes on a reinvigorated, more welcoming perspective. It’s set in the crowded cityscape, the hustle and bustle of urban sprawl reflected in the band’s rip-roaring guitars and whirlwind drumming. Their production is tighter and heftier; their hooks are sharper. Vocalist Nur Wahidah doesn’t sound overwhelmed, but hopeful as she surveys her surroundings and glimpses greenery. On “Everything,” she notices wildflowers growing out of car parks and waxes poetic about the sunrise: “Watching the gold bathe the birds/Bringing song into cities/Bringing luxury in our souls.”Across the album, she’s self-assured and playful. She responds with cool-headed sass to the demands of a nine-to-five, like on the gleeful, hooky “J-O-B” or the scuzzy “Machine,” where her mocking observations on being a corporate cog get swallowed by an exhilarating guitar solo. Bandmates Daniel Borces and Jared Lim act as strong complements to her lead. On the skittish opener “Performative,” Borces lights her flippant narration of political activism—“Signing petitions, charging laptops, separating causes from ourselves”—up with a sublime riff, shaking off the song’s creeping malaise. Elsewhere, the pair’s textured performances lend warmth to Subsonic Eye’s boisterous noise pop: Their bright guitar tones have an electrifying glint, while the reverb-heavy, shoegaze fuzz conjures the prickling sensation of sunlight on skin.Subsonic Eye are at their most urgent and heartfelt on “Yearning,” the explosive climax of All Around You. With thrashing guitars and hammered drums, the song explores the heat of desire. As the guitars cool to a rolling swell, Wahidah finds comfort in an affectionate embrace: “You woke me from my slumber, I fall down on my knees/Basking in your warm light, it’s how I came to be,” she sings, still searching for the natural even in the arms of another. She nudges forward, driven by her hunger for contact, but it's the surge of the band that pushes her through. Even when her optimism falters, they’re a supportive backing. All Around You proves that connection—to nature, to a lover—can be a profoundly potent force.All products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.

803,"Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past. Today we revisit Gillian Welch and Dave Rawlings’ third album, an Americana masterpiece whose prophecies reverberate through modern folk and indie rock. The only time most people have heard the word “revelator” is in reference to the Bible. John the Revelator was the prophet who wrote the Book of Revelation, the final part of the New Testament. As the story goes, John was exiled to a Greek island as persecution for his Christian faith and wrote down his visions of the apocalypse as communicated by Jesus. Filtered through John, who was writing around 95 AD, these visions resemble a dystopian nightmare: the rise of the beast, masquerading as a charismatic ruler, whose mark must be resisted should you desire entry into heaven; the mysterious disappearance of believers during the rapture; and ultimately, after God goes full scorched-earth, a second coming. My father, a follower of John, said that taking in the predictions of Revelation was so intense, it caused him bouts of overwhelming existential dread.Inspired by Son House’s gospel-blues classic “John the Revelator,” Gillian Welch “picked up the word ‘revelator’ and reapplied” it as the title of her third album. But as the alt-country musician told Billboard upon Time (The Revelator)’s release in July 2001, she was hesitant to over-explain the usage. She did not include the album’s lyrics in the original liner notes, an unconventional move in the CD era but one that held intentional meaning for Welch. “There are a lot of words on this album, but they shouldn’t be read—just heard,” she said. “The meaning has to do with the way they sound.”You could say Welch was working in an oratory tradition, pulling from folk music and Biblical storytelling by tying up the message with its divine expression. But there was also the rare nature of her collaboration with longtime musical and romantic partner David Rawlings. Welch’s father once likened the couple’s locked-in concentration to “breathing together,” and Welch herself, in the same New Yorker, said that she loses track of which voice is hers and which is Rawlings’. On the chorus of Time’s opener, “Revelator,” his voice lags behind hers at such a close interval that it creates an eerie echo, the first but not the last time this occurs on the album. The interplay between their acoustic guitars is so lively and seamless on the “Revelator” solo that it actually makes me angry to remember that record-industry execs once tried to get Welch to perform with other guitarists.Billed under just Welch’s name but very much a duo, Welch and Rawlings have worked almost exclusively with one another since meeting at Berklee School of Music in the early ’90s. (She was the Cali-raised adopted daughter of professional entertainers; he was a Rhode Island boy favoring cheap, gross, extremely old guitars; they were stuck at a jazz school.) On their first two albums, 1996’s Revival and 1998’s Hell Among the Yearlings, both produced by Americana kingmaker T Bone Burnett, Welch sang lead on country story-songs about miners and orphans, determined little mountain flowers, and the ghost of a rapist who haunts his poor wife (who killed him, of course). Shortly before making Time, Welch covered a duo of traditional songs alongside alt-country heroines like Alison Krauss and Emmylou Harris for the wildly successful soundtrack to O Brother, Where Art Thou?, a roots-music anointment sealed with Welch’s cameo in the Coen brothers’ film. Around the same time, her record deal with Almo Sounds dissolved, which led to the founding of the duo’s own Acony Records, their label to this day.",Folk,9.6
804,"This 1977 album was obscure in its day, but it spawned a fervent cult among fans of spiritual jazz, for good reason: The no-frills recording captures a feeling of unearthly magic. Lavish reissues of a single album usually signify the record’s general sense of importance: We need to gather all that’s known about this work, they suggest, every note and outtake, in order to more completely understand its historical moment. The new edition of Pharoah Sanders’ 1977 album Pharoah, which comes in a beautiful box with an expansive booklet filled with essays and interviews, a companion live disc, sheet music, photographs, and more, is trying to correct the record rather than expand upon it.In the grand scheme of jazz history, Pharoah is merely one LP among the dozens the saxophonist issued between the blistering far-out free jazz of his 1965 debut and Promises, the album he made with Floating Points that was issued in 2021, about 18 months before his death. Pharoah was cut for India Navigation, a small imprint that specialized in the jazz avant-garde, and it sold poorly and was not regarded highly by its maker. Though it made little impact at the time, Pharoah spawned a fervent cult among spiritual-jazz fans, particularly those who enjoy the chase for rare LPs. This reissue, while not cheap, is a bargain compared to the hundreds of dollars one might spend for a beat-up original. And the music itself, which is identifiably the work of its creator but has a highly unusual atmosphere all its own, easily justifies the effort and care that went into the set.The secret appeal of Pharoah is the quality that ultimately gave Sanders pause when the album was first coming together: As a recording, it sounds crude and homemade, which it was. It was cut in a former factory in upstate New York where India Navigation founder Bob Cummins, an attorney and jazz obsessive, lived with his family. Cummins would put out records by important jazz figures, including saxophonist David Murray and bassist Cecil McBee. But he typically issued live albums and was not an engineer by trade. He and Sanders had trouble agreeing on the details of this project, and in the end, neither man was happy with how it turned out. But the modest recording is perfect for the music, framing a peculiar mood and atmosphere that’s lusty and joyous one moment and haunting and meditative the next.The side-long “Harvest Time” opens the record with guitarist Tisziji Muñoz and bassist Steve Neil sketching out a two-chord vamp. When Sanders enters, his tone is smoky and relaxed, perfect for a late-night seance. He darts across the melody and fixates on his lower range, where the resonance of his instrument’s reed makes you think of a rumbly congested breath more than a melodic voice. Sanders jumps an octave for some trills and Muñoz joins him, breaking out of his two-chord reverie, and then percussion enters—bowls, bells; you can smell the burning sandalwood—followed by droning harmonium from Sanders’ then-wife Bedria. After 20 minutes that seem to race by, the piece drifts away, as if dispersed by the wind.",Jazz,8.9
