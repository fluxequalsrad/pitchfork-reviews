    "    {\"Date\": \"2024-09-19\", \"Artist\": \"The War on Drugs\", \"Album\": \"LIVE DRUGS AGAIN\", \"Genre\": \"Rock\", \"Text\": 'The Philly group’s second live album is a celebration of the band as a symbiotic unit and an impressive distillation of its cosmic Americana sound. Even in the band’s ramshackle early days, the War on Drugs’ music could change the dimensions of a room. They didn’t achieve this feat through sheer volume alone (though songs like “Show Me The Coast” or “It’s Your Destiny” could reach intimidating decibel levels) but through scope: enormous emotions peeking through the curtain of incandescent synths and droning guitar. They made hanging in a dingy rock club watching four wiry Philly dudes conjure a multicolored squall feel like standing on the edge of a cliff, the universe roaring in your ears that you’re smaller than you think. When the War on Drugs grew to a sextet to bring Lost in the Dream’s variegated haze to the stage, their sound pushed against the rafters of thousand-cap venues, fully realizing the kind of immensity music writers love to call “stadium-sized.” LIVE DRUGS, the band’s first live album, collected soundboard recordings from 2014 to 2019, focusing on cuts from Lost in the Dream and A Deeper Understanding. Four years later, they’re back with LIVE DRUGS AGAIN, sourcing takes from their 2022 and 2023 runs. Like its predecessor, LIVE DRUGS AGAIN feels like a single show, one where you lucked into the perfect spot in front of the soundboard, awestruck by a band that exudes the ineffable combination of tour-tight and casual. LIVE DRUGS AGAIN is an expansion in many ways: The band added multi-instrumentalist Eliza Hardy Jones in 2022, and the set draws heavily from 2021’s shimmering prairiecore opus I Don’t Live Here Anymore. It’s even more painstakingly assembled—Granduciel stitched this version of “Under the Pressure,” for example, from six different performances. Here, the music doesn’t smear together into a beautiful mass like the sound of the War on Drugs of yore; instead, it builds into a towering, complex structure. This new, seven-piece configuration of the War on Drugs plays with remarkable patience. There’s a newfound—or at least newly emphasized—attention to the interlocking rhythms that bolster the songs’ swooning Heartland core. Granduciel’s solos aren’t as jammy as in the past, trading the minutes-long shred sessions for a more measured take on hypnotic maximalism. The band assembles “Living Proof” brick by brick, starting with sixteenth-note guitar strums, then adding eighth-note hi-hats, syncopated bass drums, and that hooky keyboard line that hovers in a fog of reverb. It’s almost techno-like in construction, meticulously building tension and ending in a quietly cathartic payoff when the groove downshifts into its roots-rock coda. During some songs, you can pick out one element—the dusty Linn Drum backbone of “Burning,” Dave Hartley’s motorik bassline during “Slow Ghost”—and follow it like a single stream into a tremendous waterfall. The most surprising inclusion on LIVE DRUGS AGAIN is “Come To The City,” a Drughead favorite from 2011’s Slave Ambient. On the album, Granduciel sounds as though he’s singing from the eye of a hurricane, a buzzing cloud of overlapping chords threatening to consume him whole. Live, the band plays like a slowly darkening sky, adding a new layer every few bars until it becomes a colossal, undulating mass. The ambient intro unfurls for a full minute before Robbie Bennett’s triangular piano figure emerges from the haze, and Granduciel sings like he knows what’s coming, the desperation of the studio version replaced with weary wisdom. After dipping into a couple of gorgeous guitar solos, each preceded by a signature Granduciel “Woo!”, the outro sends it skyward. Jones and Granduciel harmonize on the repeated phrase, “I could leave it all,” as the band adds another chord to its structure, giving the droning churn a tinge of hope. It’s a near-perfect distillation of the cosmic, psychedelic Americana that the War on Drugs has been honing for the past 15 years. In press photos and liner notes, Granduciel is the face and catalyzing force of the War on Drugs. But what LIVE DRUGS AGAIN proves, more than LIVE DRUGS, and maybe more than any of their studio albums, is the band’s force as a symbiotic unit. During an extended opening vamp on “I Don’t Live Here Anymore,” Granduciel lovingly introduces the members (save Bennett, whom he refers to as an “international rock icon” at the end of “Come To The City”), singing their names or peppering in an esoteric inside joke. When the whole group finally launches into the stadium-sized anthem, it feels like it’s existed forever, pulled whole from the ether by an ensemble connected via telepathy and MIDI data. That energy exchange seeps out into the audience, each song becoming an act of communion. As Granduciel sings “You’re on your own” near the end of “Harmonia’s Dream,” the crowd begins to cheer, refuting his words, celebrating that they’re all in it together.', \"Score\": 7.9},\n",
    "    {\"Date\": \"2024-09-19\", \"Artist\": \"Wendy Eisenberg\", \"Album\": \"Viewfinder\", \"Genre\": \"Jazz\", \"Text\": 'Laser eye surgery enabled the guitarist to see clearly. Their new album draws on the improvisatory techniques of free jazz to explore the slippery nature of human perception. Throughout Viewfinder, the latest album by the prolific guitarist and collaborator Wendy Eisenberg, the sound of the room is often not just audible, but conspicuous. At the outset of “Set a Course,” the member of Editrix, Birthing Hips, and the Bill Orcutt Quartet sings a capella, their notes clear and plainspoken and long, and the softly hissing presence of the recording space becomes increasingly close. It may seem strange to remark on the subtlest part of an album that revolves around a 22-minute noise epic that constantly collapses in and out of sync. But the room tone feels like it’s there to be noticed. Viewfinder was inspired by the Maryland-raised, Brooklyn-based musician’s experience getting laser surgery to remedy a lifetime of eye problems. The disorienting experience of being able to see clearly for the first time sent them diving into the concept of sight, studying the work of John Berger, Jacqueline Rose, and the quack medic who blinded Handel and Bach. Eisenberg’s wide-ranging research prompted them to consider the subjectivity and potential oppressiveness of being defined by a single perspective. In the same way that a printed photograph makes the permanence of a split-second clear—how “a picture lives a lifetime out of time,” as Eisenberg states on “If an Artist”—foregrounding the materiality of the recording highlights the idea that these 79 improvisatory minutes were just 79 minutes among potentially many more; that although this is the recording of the ensemble’s work you are hearing, that doesn’t necessarily make it definitive. It’s indicative of the slipperiness of Viewfinder, which starts with “Lasik,” Eisenberg’s account of getting eye surgery. Above all, it’s a warning to themself—and by extension, any listener hoping for easy platitudes about life in hi-def—that “changing isn’t healing.” If anything, the six-minute track suggests the opposite: fraught and close, low horns lurking like flickering shadows, Eisenberg’s guitar locked into a minor half-siren motif, the drums skittish and dry and close; but then the guitar being stroked up and down the fretboard, the effect tender but disorientating, followed by tense static and grave violin sawing. The knotted construction of the song, and Eisenberg’s serious, earnest tone throughout, bring to mind Phil Elverum or British iconoclast Richard Dawson, and how both stake out their territory with the tension of deepening inquiry, stretching the limits of what is known. In the liner notes, Eisenberg concludes: “Since writing this music, I have begun to comfort myself with the notion that loving something does not require that what is beloved be understood.” Viewfinder is primarily instrumental, spanning free jazz, post-rock, flashes of beauty, and pockets of mournfulness. Its textures are wild and tangled, with repeating harmonic patches that quickly slip away. There is the temptation with any instrumental music to overlay a narrative—and not least when a record like this dangles such easy metaphors as clarity, obscurity, and resistance. So the lightest way to frame these digressions might be as reflections of the joy of discovery, of allowing things to change and marveling as they do. “Two Times Water” has picaresque woodwinds, puckish piano, billowing horns, then a moment where every element of the instrumentation seems to try and make a break for it; “HM” is harsher, everything playing at cross purposes while that siren guitar motif returns. “Afterimage” is the 22-minute centerpiece, beginning with cool, walking bass and lightly fizzing cymbals dragged down by a heavy anchor of piano and horns. It’s variously arid, booming, busy, and empty; at one point, the drums vibrate so finely they sound like hummingbird wings. It rarely settles and can feel like being tossed around in stormy waters that pay no heed to the tides. Though the band’s furrowed interplay is hugely impressive, it’s a challenging piece to absorb in one go; perhaps it would be more gripping beheld live. Aside from the sheer invention, what’s most striking about Viewfinder is Eisenberg’s ability to crystallize their complex, nuanced thoughts about the limits of perception without creating new dogma in the process. The fear of being whittled down to a clear image, even in the mirror, fuels “Set a Course,” where they aim to go “past what I’m told is abstraction/Find no other world that can touch me.” The dry, increasingly staticky “If an Artist” implies that anyone who aspires to the title must run beyond the picture’s frame, eluding capture, and Eisenberg sings in a high, uncertain tone as the quiet resounds. The gnarled and broken loops of the title track echo the punishingly unproductive spiral of poor self-image, the thoughts “satisfied with poisoning my mind.” Viewfinder closes with an excellent, lonely rewrite of the folk song “In the Pines” that’s chilling both for the spooked lounge instrumentation and Eisenberg’s observation that the bliss of the unobserved is always short-lived, the violence of being reduced and taxonomized all but inevitable. Once again, they make the case for elusiveness feel like a clear statement: testament to Eisenberg’s unique vision.', \"Score\": 7.7},\n",
    "    {\"Date\": \"2024-09-18\", \"Artist\": \"Nilüfer Yanya\", \"Album\": \"My Method Actor\", \"Genre\": \"Pop/R&B\", \"Text\": 'On her third album, the UK singer-songwriter sounds relaxed, confident, unflappably cool, even in moments of conflict. The result is an album of everyday luxury, lush and unhurried. The way Nilüfer Yanya plays the guitar, with a hollow picking, it’s like she’s scratching an incessant itch. It’s an intimate feeling to be let in on as a listener, but it’s also given her songs an occasional harried edge. The British indie musician’s first album, 2019’s Miss Universe, was raucous and bold, but when she sang of “lying in a pool of someone else’s blood,” you didn’t get the feeling she was exactly relaxed. Her second album, 2022’s PAINLESS (a misdirection of a title if I ever heard one), throbbed with Yanya’s honeyed vocals wrapped around her serpentine guitar melodies. The music was tantalizing but it was anxious, sometimes showy. Not a bad thing, but it felt self-conscious, like she had something to prove. On her third and best album, My Method Actor, she’s matured, found herself, chilled out—whatever you want to call it, it’s made her music more triumphant, less nervous. It’s an album that has the feel of everyday luxury, a collection of songs so assured that they feel like they always existed, and Yanya simply plucked them out of the air to give to you. She’s not without her problems (the thorniness of romance is a lyrical theme), but instead of shredding out her frustrations out with a gnarly riff or a honking saxophone solo, she owns them poetically, giving a torch singer’s graceful performance across the album’s 11 songs. Yanya’s signature guitar sound is still present, but the itch has been scratched. Some of that newfound ease may be thanks to songwriter Wilma Archer, once an electronic music producer known as Slime who co-wrote My Method Actor with Yanya. This is the first album where Yanya has worked with only one producer, and having a steady collaborator gives the album a cohesion you may not have noticed the previous two didn’t have. The sound is unhurried and lush, with Yanya’s voice confidently tender. “I’m a loser first/Come on do your worst,” she taunts on album opener “Keep On Dancing,” in a line that might recall a classic retort from Girls’ Hannah Horvath: “Any mean thing someone’s gonna think of to say about me, I’ve already said to me, about me.” Except (no spoilers) I don’t think Hannah actualized the lesson from that kind of self-critique in the way Yanya has. What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. In fact, “Keep On Dancing” begins with a moment of vinegar, a gauntlet thrown. “What you looking for?/Shut up and raise your glass if you’re not sure/Still I can smile, it’s fucking miserable/So deep in the crime of being beautiful.” She says “shut up” in a way that drips with bile, and delivers the rest of the lines unapologetically. Whoever she is talking to deserves it. But this is not a mean or spiteful album. It’s an album about getting comfortable in the discomfort. On the single “Like I Say (I runaway),” Yanya sings, “The minute I’m not in control/I’m tearing up inside.” It’s a line that would make a therapist simultaneously concerned yet proud of her self-awareness. In the music video, Yanya plays a runaway bride, an image perhaps a little too on the nose. But when she loses her veil and escapes, it’s not into someone else’s arms, The Graduate-style, but into an empty field. She looks around at the trees, the sky. Nothing offers her an idea of her next move. She didn’t bail because she had a better thing going, she just knew that what was in front of her wasn’t right, and so she did something about it. This bounding into the unknown is expressed throughout the album with light accent pieces, notably Joe Harvey-Whyte’s plaintively played pedal-steel guitar, which shows up on four tracks, and Clíona Ní Choileáin’s august cello performance, which shows up on two. Neither instrument is over- or underutilized, and neither overwhelms the songs with anything florid. When Choileáin’s instrument enters towards the end of “Mutations,” a song with a bit of an angsty constitution, it just feels like relief. One of my favorite songs on My Method Actor is “Binding,” which may be the record’s quietest. It’s exemplary of the album’s easy strength; her voice exudes confidence. It’s a Sade-style miracle Yanya’s singing pumps out such force while hardly ever needing to rise above a whisper. Matching her vocal performance, “Binding” boils the instrumentation down to the bare bones, but nothing is lost. The song is made of not much more than a spare drum line, pedal steel, and folky strum of the guitar, while Yanya sings an impressionistic tale that is either about a car accident, getting high, or the end of a relationship. Maybe all three? She isn’t sure. In a recent interview, Yanya said of the song, “I can’t be too certain, but all the lyrics leading up to that are about someone being totally out of it, like they’ve drunk too much, or they’re on this long drive and are not really present.” She says the song’s subject is “trying to escape and get to this blissful nowhereness, of leaving their body behind.” That sounds good, until you realize maybe it doesn’t. It’s nice to regard the soul, but on this journey to nirvana, does our earthly body not deserve some respect? Apparently not. On “Made Out of Memory,” Yanya, wispy and staccato, directly addresses this corporeal egress with some of the album’s most threatening lyrics, knife to her own throat: “I’ll dig my own grave/I don’t give a fuck.” Another venomous moment. But one done with admirable self-acceptance, however troubled. The next line: “You know I’m not ashamed to jump in.” You have to believe her.', \"Score\": 8.5},\n",
    "    {\"Date\": \"2024-09-18\", \"Artist\": \"Porches\", \"Album\": \"Shirt\", \"Genre\": \"Rock\", \"Text\": 'On his heaviest, spikiest album to date, Aaron Maine’s shredded production and raw arrangements evoke existential angst and quotidian despair. Aaron Maine has always had a complicated relationship with rock’n’roll. In the early 2010s, his band Porches crystallized around unsteady and unsettled guitar music fit for the scrappy DIY venues and dingy basements he often played across the Northeast. Since then, his songs of yearning have become more experimental and opaque, taking tangents through misty synth-pop (2016’s Pool), dreamy dance music (2018’s The House), and blunted ballads that recall Arthur Russell’s lonesome home recordings (2020’s Ricky Music). But recently, he’s been thinking about getting loud again. On tour in support of the exuberant pop songs from 2021’s All Day Gentle Hold !, Maine got a chance to indulge that urge. He turned up the distortion on his guitar, thrashed around the stage, and screamed—a way of exorcizing the anxiety and unhinged energy that lurks beneath his music, even at its softest. These shows provided the immediate spark for Shirt, Maine’s sixth studio album as Porches, a collection of the most crushing songs he’s recorded to date. The record’s heaviest moments document what he’s called the “precarious emotional state” that he put himself in while making the record. Working in a windowless basement rehearsal space and smoking “a lot of weed” for the first time in his life, he allowed himself to explore an emotional terrain he doesn’t often access. He wrote songs about existential anxiety and day-to-day distress, accompanying the abstract yet upsetting imagery of his lyrics with shredded production and raw arrangements. Single “Rag” is perhaps most indicative of the intensity that Maine reaches toward throughout Shirt. Wounded and paranoid, he braids together lyrics about libidinous desire and flickering violence over a blown-out instrumental that evokes Deerhunter’s in-the-red adventures on Monomania. The coiled intensity of “Sally” recalls the gnarled miniatures that Maine’s former tourmate Alex G nestled between love songs on his own early records. On “Itch,” Maine further explores this distorted desperation, offering words of piety and pain while slamming away on menacing guitar chords that clang and clatter like an oil drum striking concrete. Shirt’s most striking moments twist these familiar rock tropes into something more uncanny. Auto-Tune, an occasional fixation of Maine’s, renders his voice gooey and gross, smearing it across the tracks like a bug caught under a windshield wiper. Even as guitars loom in the foreground, there are also moments like the narcotic ballad “Precious,” where every layer sounds unsteady and tense, as if a sinkhole might open up and swallow it. These are striking choices from an artist who’s spent nearly a decade making music that appeared conscious of its distance from his indie-rock roots. Now returning to those sounds, Maine uses them to create something more surreal and strange than he’s ever attempted. On the closing track, “Music,” he reflects, for a moment, on the merits of a life in rock. “I love to feel the highs,” he sings, “I love to feel the lows.” The mumbled couplet feels like an understatement. Knotty, distorted, and alien, Shirt operates only in intensity and extremes, an adrenaline shot for a songwriter liable to get lost in dreams.', \"Score\": 7.2},\n",
    "    {\"Date\": \"2024-09-18\", \"Artist\": \"Callahan & Witscher\", \"Album\": \"Think Differently\", \"Genre\": \"Experimental\", \"Text\": 'The New York experimental duo gets meta on a concept album about experimental music that’s littered with meme effects and shitpost irreverence. It feels like a Discord thread set to music. In F. Scott Fitzgerald’s 1936 essay “The Crack-Up,” the writer describes a period in which his mind runs amok; he loses the desire to strive and socialize and withers into a sad-sack cynic. His main source of entertainment is list-making—football players, popular songs, suits he’s worn— and he becomes bitter about the most trivial things. He reflects that once upon a time, before the crack-up, he fancied it “a romantic business to be a successful literary man—you were not ever going to be as famous as a movie star but what note you had was probably longer-lived.” It must feel similar to be an experimental musician, nobly laboring to shatter the boundaries of sound, yet receiving minimal fanfare and being misconstrued by critics. Jack Callahan and Jeff Witscher’s debut joint record, Think Differently, unravels like a musical midlife crisis. It interrogates their careers and the experimental scene but also feels like a long improv sketch, a self-aware simulation of two avant-gardists losing their head and going pop. Call it SoundClown performance art. Think Differently’s hyper-eclectic pulp-rock and quivering Auto-Tune hooks will startle anyone who’s only familiar with their stim-board sound collages. Take Callahan’s Trap Studies, which rewired Zaytoven and Lex Luger shards into what sounds like an isolated FL Studio layer left on loop after the producer fell asleep. Witscher’s Twitch pooled audio from random streams into a frazzled info overload. The closest thing to Think Differently is their surreal 2023 performance “Bring The Flowers to the Theatre,” where they deadpanned on insular themes like review scores and delay effects and punctuated sentences with inane FX. It might be the only performance in history to include jokes about Ridgewood gentrification and also the “BABA BOOEY” groan. The album plays out the same—sardonic and sincere skits about their lives as musicians constantly interrupted by puerile soundbites—but with a new layer of zany alt-rock and trip-hop. Instead of Fitzgerald writing lists of cavalry leaders and football players, the duo assembled a terabytes’ worth of meme effects. They seem to have deliberately chosen the most grating and overused sounds, perhaps to express their dread about the internet and cultural sterility. There’s a Roblox “oof” grunt, the Taco Bell bong, and “ohmaaagawd.” There’s an interpolation of Linkin Park’s “In the End”; one song deploys Masked Wolf’s infamously awful \"Astronaut in the Ocean\" as a riser. The opener is a spoken-word remix of “I miss the old Kanye,” but this time what’s pined for is music with “soul.” It lashes against the “Bandcamp bestowed,” “status quo,” “bar so low” music of today; there are vocals from AI versions of Mr. Krabs and Peter Griffin. Imagine a meme megamix for washed-up Redditors—it’s the kind of album that works best as fodder for Discord debates, not necessarily as a repeat listening experience. Trapped inside the skittering shitposts are gripes and anxieties, mostly confined to the world of experimental music discourse. “Boiler Room” derides the electronic media institution. “Thank you for giving me this wonderful opportunity to… create content for ad revenue,” Callahan croaks in copious voice-correction software, like a constipated Laura Les. It’s often hard to tell if they’re being serious or silly, whether they’re two dudes rediscovering their love of music or going Smash Mouth and “Losing My Edge” mode as a bit. The ambivalence is the point; the album drips with the desire to be dissected, but also wants to be silly enough to frame itself as scallywags goofing off. At the end of “Who Knows Where the Time Goes,” a Cameo they ordered from a TikTok comedian goes: “Oh, you do experimental music? You did the experiment. What’s the outcome? Oh, nobody like y’all stuff, dog. Time to move on.” The tongue is so far in cheek it’s about to poke through. Elsewhere, they seem genuinely depressed about the unsustainable state of touring and the experimental scene. At its best, there’s a kind of doomer catharsis to the way Callahan and Witscher constantly return to the idea of wasted time, wondering if their lives add up to anything more than the sum of their nights spent in clubs and days on the road. The sweet instrumentation helps offset the memes and insidery, like an aural antidote for normies without brainworms. Callahan’s churning, galloping guitar provides the album’s giddy field-trip groove. “Long Drive” rolls and pops with the unwieldy bounce of a monster truck in a cartoon. The grayscale glide of “Participation Trophy” syncs up smoothly with the dry delivery. Ana Roxanne’s ribbon-soft melodies on “Hate the Player” hit like a touch-grass moment. But Callahan and Witscher’s concerns would feel more urgent if the songs actually jolted the brain with wild weirdness, rather than being swathed in a blanket of winky brainrot rock. It’s like British producer Baron Mordant’s stream-of-conscious mocking of left-field music fatuities, but neither texturally haunting nor bitingly witty. At least now the world has a song about loving the grind of creating art, despite it often feeling like a frivolous fool’s errand, that also features reverb Dave Chappelle and the goofy ahh ringtone. They did the experiment.', \"Score\": 6.3},\n",
    "    {\"Date\": \"2024-09-17\", \"Artist\": \"Foxing\", \"Album\": \"Foxing\", \"Genre\": \"Rock\", \"Text\": 'On their self-titled fifth album, the cult emo rockers construct a story of hard work, disillusionment, and nu-metal. Failure is the secret of Foxing’s success. The St. Louis band’s most popular songs to date are either about romantic rejection or religious trauma, or the indignity of having to relive those indignities onstage, or the financial precarity that comes with reliving those indignities onstage instead of, I dunno, getting a desk job with health benefits. Before the release of 2021’s Draw Down the Moon, drummer Jon Hellwig joked that Foxing might have been better off if the album flopped, giving them an excuse to opt out of emo-indie cult stardom and start playing nu-metal. That didn’t exactly happen, but they made their “Break Stuff” anyway. “Carson MTV! Bizkit NYE! Fuck! Fuck! Fuuuck!” guitarist Eric Hudson shrieks on the priceless chorus of “Hell 99,” a stadium-sized skramz spasm that is arguably the most aggro and the most catchy Foxing song yet, and undeniably the first that sounds like they’re having fun. After a decade shooting for the stars, Foxing is the sound of a band liberated by wallowing in the mud. By swapping the sounds of Coachella 2012 for Woodstock ’99, “Hell 99” might appear as a course correction for Draw Down the Moon, an album that couldn’t totally beat the Grouplove allegations but had fathoms of dread beneath its Day-Glo exterior. Singer Conor Murphy means to be taken at face value when he blares, “Throw out all the joy and show me metrics for my failures.” But the only major difference between the subject matter of Foxing and its predecessor is that the latter lacked any songs about his dog dying. This album counts at least two. Think of Foxing as Nearer My God’s evil genius twin: the type that spends more time in detention than study hall and still ends up with an A. Where in the past the band’s experimentalism was anchored by clean, rafter-reaching choruses, Foxing genre-leaps without a net, trusting its weirdest impulses to embellish and deliver the hooks. No spoilers for opener “Secret History”: Just know that by comparison, “Hell 99” is kind of a breather, at least before a refrain of “Constant shame! Constant fatigue!” hyperventilates into an ambient collapse. “Gratitude” is the one Obama-core throwback, performed with a white-knuckled intensity equal to the parts of Foxing that might credibly be compared to Deafheaven, Knocked Loose, and, in the case of “Dead Internet,” a Soundgarden mp3 playing through a dial-up modem. For 56 minutes Foxing alternately thrills and confounds but provides little in the way of catharsis. No longer daydreaming of planetary apocalypse, Foxing fears not death but dying, the Doomsday Clock that starts up with every morning alarm. The mantras provide grounding and no relief—“You’re on your own”; “Repeat and then repeat, you can never really leave”; “What if it doesn’t matter anymore?” On “Kentucky McDonald’s” the vocal, lead, and rhythm guitar melodies appear to be going in opposite directions, as if drawn and quartered by Nearer My God’s four horsemen. The arrangement turns molten as Murphy sounds like he’s choking on his own blood, but there’s no release, only more tension. Questioning your entire life on a Ronald McDonald bench is not something that should be resolved in four minutes. Murphy likens the Foxing experience to a slow drowning on “Greyhound,” which thrashes to the surface only for him to yell, “It means nothing to me!” If only. In an interview, Foxing revealed how much they despised each other during the album’s recording, how Hudson spent five days “hate-mixing” a song that he couldn’t wrap his head around and experienced “the darkest fucking thoughts of my life” revisiting The Albatross for adoring crowds in 2023. They don’t give a firm answer as to whether it was all worth it. Foxing concludes with a recording of Hudson at 13, saying to Murphy, “I don’t think the song is as good as it could be, but it’s coming along.” If they could have seen 20 years ahead, would they keep at it? As Murphy sighs during the preceding piano ballad “Cry Baby,” “If I could I’d start over again/It’s been fun but I’d change everything.” Foxing isn’t a sob story from a band that is, objectively, more successful than most of its peers. Save for a few snapshots from the road, Murphy’s words could be those of a middle school teacher buying their own supplies for the next term, a harried public defender $250,000 in debt, or basically anyone exploited by their idealism long enough to realize salvation isn’t coming. If there were a viral hit or festival booking that could make Foxing feel secure, it probably won’t come from this album. Instead, the meaning comes from the dozens of little moments when they’ve pushed themselves further than they imagined, without promise of any future reward. The days of yelling “I want it all” to an imagined arena audience are gone. Foxing are learning to want what they have.', \"Score\": 7.8},\n",
    "    {\"Date\": \"2024-09-17\", \"Artist\": \"BASIC\", \"Album\": \"This Is BASIC\", \"Genre\": \"Rock/Experimental\", \"Text\": 'The Philadelphia trio pays tribute to a baffling 1984 LP of programmed drums and indulgent guitar recorded by an obstinate Lou Reed collaborator. They’re not so much imitators as acolytes. Few people understood Basic when it came out and even fewer liked it. By 1984, Robert Quine was already legendary for his guitar work on Richard Hell and the Voidoids’ Blank Generation and Lydia Lunch’s Queen of Siam. He had recorded several albums with Lou Reed, who he adored and hated in equal measure, and with whom he constantly clashed. The notoriously contentious Quine had done his time in the New York City underground and was sick of being sidelined by its outsized personalities. He decided to join up with Reed’s drummer Fred Maher and create a record exactly how he liked: a bizarre mix of programmed drums, ambient drift, and indulgent guitar explorations. These sounds were outré at the time, but they quickly became dated. Quine didn’t care. “On Basic, the drums are too loud and this and that but that’s the way I wanted it,” he said in 1997. “If people don’t appreciate the damn thing, I have no interest in banging my head against the wall.” According to Philadelphia guitarist Chris Forsyth, everybody’s gotten it wrong. He places Quine in the company of Miles Davis, Brian Eno, and Joni Mitchell and compares Basic to their landmark albums. Quine and Maher’s overlooked record has influenced Forsyth’s music for years, most obviously on the 20-minute guitar workout “Techno Top” from 2019’s All Time Present. But he wasn’t as alone as he thought—a resurgence of interest in Quine’s work was underway, and he was thrilled to discover that his Solar Motel Band guitarist Nick Millevoi was also a fan. During the pandemic lockdowns, Forsyth and Millevoi got together with a drum machine, using Basic as a conceptual starting point for dual-guitar jams. They quickly discovered that the collaboration made sense even to people who didn’t know about Robert Quine. And so they recruited a percussionist, Natural Information Society’s Mikel Patrick Avery, and started a band. In honor of their foundational text, they called it BASIC. Here are the basic elements of a This is BASIC song: polyrhythmic drum programming a bit too high in the mix, like Quine would’ve done; Avery’s percussion adding a steady groove; Millevoi’s thundering baritone guitar; and Forsyth’s lead lines ringing out over top. When they play live, Avery sits behind a bass drum, cowbell, and shaker, with two guitarists flanking him. Everyone can always see each other; this friendly surveillance is necessary for the band’s semi-improv. On “For Stars of the Air,” the album’s sprawling, nine-minute opener, Forsyth adds chiming harmonics over the drum machine’s jittery hi-hat until Millevoi steps in with shuddering waves of baritone, allowing Forsyth to move along to an intricate, flanged-out solo. Only after this interplay is established does Avery complicate the beat, propelling the group forward in double time. Once any two players lock into a pattern, the third is free to roam until he finds a new fixation, and so each track can change direction with a nod or a reciprocal glance: We’ve got this, go your own way. Of course, BASIC are more than Basic. They mine from other ’80s acts too, including the Durutti Column’s pristine chorus-pedal shimmer on “Positive Halfway” and the Clean’s upbeat jangle on “Nerve Time.” But structurally, this is modern stuff: Like a less shambolic version of 75 Dollar Bill or a more shambolic version of the Bill Orcutt Guitar Quartet, the band repeats simple parts with such insistence and drive that they turn minimalism into maximalism. On “New Auspicious,” Forsyth plays the same eight-note figure again and again over Millevoi’s galloping rhythm guitar. Then he decides to join the galloping himself. These two sections, with slight variations, alternate to form the whole of the song, and this repetition turns ecstatic exactly because it becomes so expected. Sometimes the desire to follow Quine, a rather myopic muse, leads BASIC into trouble. “Last Resort of the Gambling Man” aims for the ambient lull of Basic’s “Dark Place” but ends up listless instead. When Forsyth piles on effects like Quine does, as in the wild wah-wah of “Versatile Switch,” he risks sounding tasteless, too. But these are faults that BASIC are glad to share with their namesake, proof that they truly embrace its sound. For Basic’s devoted fan base, This Is BASIC is evidence, finally, of the album’s enduring influence. It took 40 years but people are beginning to appreciate the damn thing.', \"Score\": 7.6},\n",
    "    {\"Date\": \"2024-09-17\", \"Artist\": \"Hayden Pedigo\", \"Album\": \"Live in Amarillo, Texas\", \"Genre\": \"Rock\", \"Text\": 'A December 2023 performance recorded in the guitarist’s beloved hometown displays his playing at its most expressive and expansive. A few songs into Live in Amarillo, Texas, Hayden Pedigo lays out a few flaws that other people see in his hometown. Out on the road, he says, he’s aware Amarillo has a reputation as a “flat, windy, hot, cold, brutal, and somewhat ugly place.” Yet the guitarist has dedicated many of his meditative pieces to what he’s called the city’s “hard-earned beauty.” He once told a local TV station that something he most appreciated about living there was the unique experience of standing in a field stretching to the horizon in every direction. “It’s almost like a small piece of infinity,” he said. His music seeks to capture that feeling, each slowly unfurling melody a chance to lose yourself in the vastness of a single moment. Live in Amarillo, Texas, recorded in December 2023 at the theater that houses the city’s orchestra, shows Pedigo’s playing at its most expressive and expansive. The record’s six instrumental tracks—some of which stitch together multiple songs—stretch his winding compositions into otherworldly journeys that place grave importance on each phrase and pause. Opener “Carthage” (originally from 2021’s Letting Go) demonstrates the emotional weight of such an approach. Pedigo coaxes delicate, dreamy melodies from a 12-string guitar, playing softly before they fade into silence. Another guitar line drifts across the room, purposefully quiet. By the time the song builds to its more labyrinthine figures, the piece has paused a handful of times, giving even the most gently lilting melodies a sense of unease: At any moment, Pedigo might recede into the shadows and fall silent. Pedigo presents some songs in more twisted and deliberately heavy forms than he ever has on record. In its original incarnation on Letting Go, “Rained Like Hell” was a stately acoustic piece that evoked the spiritual odysseys of Florian Fricke. The live performance is more frayed and unsettled, pulling slowly yet violently at the melodies, as if they were strapped to a rack. Pedigo has hinted at his affection for metal—he wore corpse paint in the “Letting Go” video—but this is the first time he’s conveyed it in his music. It plays like one of the frigid interludes that marked ’90s black metal albums, if any of those acts had been just a little more into the blues. Over the years, Pedigo has developed a reputation as one of experimental music’s most irrepressible pranksters. He’s trolled local businesses, posted goofy fits on Reddit until he was invited to walk for Gucci, and launched a bid for Amarillo City Council with a surreal, distorted camcorder video (he ultimately finished second to the incumbent). Live in Amarillo, Texas bears little trace of this side of his personality. In the between-song patter captured on the record, his mood is reflective and nostalgic, fitting the sentimental renditions heard throughout the performance. Pedigo’s studio recordings consistently illustrate his skill as a guitarist, but Live in Amarillo, Texas demonstrates his greatest talent isn’t technical fireworks. A glowing emotional core presents itself in these stretched-out arrangements and stripped-down moments, something raw and real that reveals itself with every breath and halting pause.', \"Score\": 7.6},\n",
    "    {\"Date\": \"2024-09-16\", \"Artist\": \"julie\", \"Album\": \"my anti-aircraft friend\", \"Genre\": \"Rock\", \"Text\": 'On its debut LP, this trio of L.A. 20-somethings digs into au courant grunge and shoegaze influences to come up with fresh, compelling alt-rock epics rendered in miniature. In 1995, Sonic Youth, then 14 years into their career, and on the cusp of a mainstream breakthrough, released a new album, Washing Machine, that closed with a nearly 20-minute song, “The Diamond Sea.” Much of it is a freeform jam of slowly unfurling guitar noise. Seemingly aware of the unpalatableness of a double-digit running time largely given over to feedback, the band released a radio edit of “Diamond Sea,” a fine enough if relatively neutered four-minute version that cuts out the squall. Its purpose was served, to a limit: The song did chart—though never higher than No. 23. Critical success abounded, but the mass market never quite caught on.By the time the members of the Los Angeles band julie were born (about halfway between the release of “Diamond Sea” and Sonic Youth’s dissolution in 2011), the brief promise of a mainstream moment for difficult rock music, in the wake of Nirvana’s success, was long in the rearview. It was now the Obama years. Boom time for Coldplay fans, not so much dissonance enthusiasts. But enter Trump, and dark clouds came to pass, as did middle-school graduation; in 2019, as high schoolers, guitarist/vocalist Keyan Pourzand, bassist/vocalist Alexandria Elizabeth, and drummer Dillon Lee, formed julie. The band’s first single, “flutter,” was released in 2020, a year in which talented young devotees of experimental rock music had plenty of reason to shrink from the known world and swath themselves in oceanic swaths of reverb. julie emerged fully formed on “flutter,” a tightly wound grunge-pop rager with Pourzand and Elizabeth trading vocals, both pleasingly apathetic. That song, like most of the rest of their subsequent songs, was propelled by a totally ballistic drum performance by Lee. They were influenced by Sonic Youth, clearly, but they had little interest in that band’s atonal wandering. Julie’s power was controlled out of the gate. Over the next three years, the group released a handful of EPs and singles, experimenting with slight shifts in sound. One song might skew more tortured emo, another more triumphant shoegaze. The brusque sheen of the Big Muff pedal is ever present, but they never overindulge in fuzzed-out theatrics. They never noodle too long. Only one song on the band’s debut album, my anti-aircraft friend, clocks in at over five minutes—and then only by three seconds. It seems that in a generation (or two) since the heyday of their preferred breed of experimental rock music, julie have mastered the task of making songs that feel sprawling and massive, but which in reality bloom and dissolve in short order. You can fit a lot of julie songs into one “Diamond Sea.” No radio edit needed. Now in their early 20s, julie are of the TikTok-native generation, and one lesson that social media has burned into the brains of young people is a need for brevity in storytelling. Consciously or otherwise, the short songs on my anti-aircraft friend are alt-rock epics told in miniature. This tightening of the sound seems to have provided a breakthrough: “flutter” has over 36 million plays on Spotify. I’d imagine my anti-aircraft friend will break them to a new level. It should. Across the album’s 10 songs, julie have honed their sound, alternating between crunch and jangle, all with great clarity. They’ve generally benefited from a bright mixing job and a sharper fidelity recording. Elizabeth’s bass is up front for many tracks, not providing a counterpoint to Pourzand’s guitar shred so much as a contrapuntal bludgeoning. Across the entire album, Lee plays the drums with the rage of a gorilla pounding its chest. It’s not exactly a chill listen. So it can be intense in Julie’s wind tunnel, but moments of reduced pace interspersed throughout help you catch your breath. “Very Little Effort” opens with a strutting bass solo, a quick moment of levity, before Elizabeth reads off a list of (mostly) adjectives (“muted/calm/malaise”) before the song kicks in like a terrorist attack on a poetry reading. Things ramp back up on the next song, “Clairbourne Practice,” which alternates between warp-speed thrashing and snotty harmonics. The song switches between movements brazenly, but without any bleeding between its parts. From a lesser band, this sort of thing could give you whiplash. Here, it’s thrilling—music to make your pupils dilate. Between Elizabeth and Pourzand, Elizabeth is the more beguiling vocalist, with her laissez-faire sneer most effective at reeling you in before the song bonks you on the head. And so the songs where she is lead are the highlights. “Feminine Adornments” features some of the album’s best lyrics. Other songs can be a bit cryptic (haven’t quite been able to puzzle out the meaning of “​​Shaolin monks they finally freak/Your little birds come all this way/One like you, for a mutt like me”), but “I’ll defile/I’ll be clean/I’ll be mean and raw,” feels like something you scratch into your desk with a pen knife. As much as I love this record, it would be naive to not admit that this type of thing has been done before. The tortured punch of Unwound, the sour rage of Hole, the distorted sass of Jesus and Mary Chain, and, of course, the everything of Sonic Youth. Right now, this sound has legs, and julie find themselves playing alongside a group of young bands who’ve similarly been entranced by the music of the ’90s. But Julie are just better than their peers. They’ve figured out how to absorb their influences while iterating their way into innovation. On each song, julie sound more like themselves: burrowing, burrowing, burrowing, each song digging deeper into the soil. Nowhere is their vision clearer or more effective than on my anti-aircraft friend’s opener, “Catalogue.” At about two minutes into the song—which until that moment has primarily moved with hurricane force—things get really slow and quiet. There’s an ominous plucking of the bass and a small shimmer of guitar, the kind of sound you get when you strum the strings on the headstock, the part you’re not supposed to play. And then, after that moment of respite, the band comes roaring back. There’s a squall of feedback that you think could last forever. With other bands, it would. But it doesn’t come to pass. Instead, the song gathers itself for what seems could be a ramping up to violent explosion. Ok, you think, here it comes. But that doesn’t happen either. What does happen to the song is a surprise: It ends.', \"Score\": 8.1},\n",

The defining moment for Phiik and Lungs so far remains a grainy video of the duo standing before racks of t-shirts in a Hoboken vintage store, rapping like their lives depend on it. As a droning loop unfurls and a raspy voice croaks, “What the fuck is good,” two boyish-looking white guys emerge, black hoodies cinched around their faces. Lungs, whose blond brows and eyelashes intensify his unblinking gaze, raps like a wartime Morse code transmission, warning of an impending anxiety attack. His skinny frame is almost alien; he jabs a bony index finger at each syllable to ensure the doomsday message sinks in. Behind him, Phiik bobs like a sidelined AND1 hooper, occasionally mouthing along. When he’s up, he darts to the mic, immediately unwinding a percussive flow that ripples and sputters like raindrops on a drumhead. “Life is anything but a dream,” he spits, “and I’m foaming at the mouth.” The video, which was filmed for Top Shelf Premium’s Off Top freestyle series, captures the sheer intensity of Phiik and Lungs as a duo. Their chemistry comes easy. They both grew up on Long Island and have been friends since high school, sharing an admiration of early Def Jux and Wu-Tang records. In 2014, Lungs joined Tase Grip, the New York City collective founded by AKAI SOLO. Phiik quickly followed suit. Theirs is a tape-saturated, dusty-but-digital sound, fresh and immediate but strikingly outside of time. The four entries in the pair’s Another Planet series, all produced by Lungs himself under the moniker LoneSword, are full of frantic, imagistic rapping over distressed samples and the occasional brittle drum loop. On Another Planet 4, the two pushed their eccentric flows further than before, partly to see if they could, but mostly, as Phiik put it on the Reel Notes podcast, to “bang ‘em over the head.” Houston producer Olasegun helms the boards on their new album Carrot Season, providing sunlit, loungey beats full of vibraphones, chorused guitars, and crisp Pete Rock snares. It’s still highly insular music, a mesmerizing deluge of internal rhymes and intricately arranged syllables, surely the product of round-the-clock recording sessions and bottomless bags of weed. But the rappers have more fully developed the contours of their voices, adding shading and depth to what could otherwise come off as exhaustingly mechanical. Much of the record’s buoyancy comes from Phiik and Lungs’s palpable love for the craft. It’s clear they’re both committed to rap as a practice, fascinated by the mechanics and malleability of language (in that same Reel Notes interview, Phiik recalls seeing a garbage bag full of Lungs’s rhyme books, each page filled to the margins). Lungs still raps like a ticker tape printout but finds the areas of give in his once-rigid cadence. On songs like “Who // Eagle Eye” and “Kurt McBurt,” he thaws his creaking monotone with a soft lilt, giving his rambly, punctuation-free lines a bit more space. Phiik’s flow is lithe, often graceful, bouncing between drums like protons seeking a negative charge. He’ll fixate on a particular sound and observe it from all angles, like on “Daily Operation:” “Sunrises with only psilocybin and simple silence/I’m breaking the science behind waking up a sleeping giant.” Neither rapper seems concerned with narrative, following instead a bent internal logic, each bugged-out image melting into the next. Phiik issues left-field roasts of lesser emcees, like on “PSG Grip,” when he explains that “every rapper an alcoholic missing their lederhosen.” Lungs often pens evocative single-line character studies, like how “the custy on a girls’ trip to the Galapagos Islands” or that “the plug’s kid a psychotic mess, if left unchecked, would be the next Putin.” Phiik imagines his death as the end of a race in Mario Kart; Lungs brews a special herbal tea, which he warns is “not legal for obvious reasons.” An off-the-cuff, communal vibe permeates Carrot Season, as though the album is a long-lost Stretch and Bobbito freestyle session, with rappers like AKAI SOLO and Homeboy Sandman showing up to kick a quick verse and linger in the blunt rotation. Given its density and hour-long runtime, the record’s vibrant colors can sometimes bleed together. It’s a lot to wrap your arms around, especially given Olasegun’s proclivity for slippery beat switches and jarring, interstitial samples. Still, Carrot Season goes down remarkably easy, the goopy, psychotropic reduction you’d get if you left Funcrusher Plus and Table Scraps on to boil.', \"Score\": 7.6},\n",

Chow Lee treats being horny as a bona fide artform. “You and your coochie is twins/You’ve got a beautiful vagina,” he repeats on “ms. beautiful V!,” his biggest single this year. Go ahead and call him shameless, but his sex raps offer a true pervert’s cocktail: crass, silly, and genuine. The New York rapper serves up this mélange à trois garnished with snappy punchlines, the banter always playful. Only a charismatic goofball could use the pickup line, “Wanna have sex? I’m the best sexer!” and come out looking slick. Lee’s self-abasement is a reminder that intimacy requires vulnerability, but it also underlines another truth: Fucking, and everything leading up to it, should be fun. When Lee and Cash Cobain dropped 2 Slizzy 2 Sexy a couple years ago, the duo rapped over Tong Li and Prince Royce tracks, announcing sample drill as fertile ground for cosmopolitan horndog anthems. Compared to other amorous styles (lovers rock, pagode romântico), sexy drill is musically and lyrically brash, addictive for its hedonistic indulgences. On his 2023 solo album Hours After the Club, Lee amped up the Jersey club kicks and nocturnal ambience while crooning about G-spots, his Auto-Tune cutting through flashy synths. His new album, Sex Drive, arrives amid a surge of sexy drill, but while artists like wolfacejoeyy and Baby Osama have brought the sound into new territories, Lee remains the genre’s greatest entertainer. Lee lives to please, and Sex Drive refines his craft: He’s still a riot, but these 19 songs are thoughtfully arranged to reveal the subtleties of his sexual pursuits. On opener “advance w her!,” the kick drum ruptures the air before shifting to a lighter, Jersey-inspired floater. His one-track mind revs with racecar intensity; his declaration that he could never get married serves as a victory lap. He’s of a different mind on “LSD,” a sultry R&B track led by drifting synths. He sings about earning love and working through conflict, bringing up cunnilingus in the sweetest tone. Occasionally, we hear a woman moan as Lee sings about wifing her. Our libido, Sex Drive reminds us, can unearth new versions of ourselves. Though Lee can handily carry a song on his own, the best features on Sex Drive elevate his storytelling. Flo Milli’s verse on the “swag it!” remix is so cocksure that it reframes Lee’s constant questioning as impassioned pleading. Anycia’s presence on “get back!” is similarly domineering. Her slow drawl stands forward in the mix, making Lee sound like a grateful kid as he sings “Damn!” in a squirrely voice. The men’s contributions are more mixed. “tequila vacay!” is most egregious, opting for vaguely tropical mush as singer Roy Woods does his best Weeknd and Post Malone impressions. Unsurprisingly, Cobain and Bay Swag’s appearances on “act bad twin!” are a highlight: It’s a Jersey club slow jam that samples PARTYNEXTDOOR and lands in a pool of dreamy synths. Hearing Lee sing about a woman “trying to match [his] sins” is a moment of sincere tenderness. The maximalist beats of “addys!” and “bangbang!” stack up sounds into rapturous, multisensory ecstasy. More straightforward tracks like “settings!” get by on the strength of Lee’s conviction (“I cannot power down!”). Sex Drive ends with “skeleTONS,” where a 40-esque beat from producer Skeyez positions the record as post-Drake—think gauzy instrumentals laced with heart-on-sleeve confessionals, except, you know, actually exciting to hear in 2024. It’s Lee’s versatility across all these styles that make his constant fantasizing feel like a worthwhile model for living.

    "    {\"Date\": \"2024-09-15\", \"Artist\": \"Basic Channel\", \"Album\": \"BCD\", \"Genre\": \"Electronic\", \"Text\": 'Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today we revisit an immortal 1995 dub-techno manifesto that forged links between Berlin, Detroit, and Jamaica, dissolving dance music’s throb into an ambient haze. The first records to carry the Basic Channel name wore it quietly, stretching and distorting the text across each record’s center label, and rendering it fainter with each release. Was Basic Channel an artist’s name? Placed alongside titles like “Phylyps Trak” and “Quadrant Dub,” the early records seemed to imply as much, even as others, like “Enforcement” and “Inversion,” were credited to someone called Cyrus. Perhaps, then, Basic Channel was a record label. But who was Cyrus? And who was responsible for pressing these elegant 12\" singles? With visual design that nodded to conceptual art’s brief fascination with Xerox machines during the 1960s, they made a clean break with the futuristic features of Detroit techno, which was just beginning to settle into orthodoxy by the early 1990s. Wherever they came from and whoever was behind them, nothing else sounded quite like Basic Channel. The project moved quickly, producing nine 12\" singles for the label between 1993 and 1994. The records were austere yet intricately constructed, using atmospheric synths and studio effects to create astoundingly dense structures that revealed new patterns with each listen. The duo’s first single, 1993’s “Enforcement,” accosts listeners with a brutal synth loop that repeats, with slight variations, for the duration of the 13-minute track. Yet those subtle changes make all the difference; muffled hi-hats and hard-panned synth pulses peek through at steady intervals, colliding with the original synth sequence to reveal new contours as the track progresses. The approach borrows as much from Manuel Göttsching’s motorik E2-E4 as it does from the dizzying phase music of minimalist pioneer Steve Reich, churning forward at a relentless pace without inducing fatigue. The pair would ultimately turn away from thundering techno, shifting their focus to subtle textures. But the single contains a template for much of what would follow, introducing mixing techniques that prioritize space, as well as a careful focus on process, that Mark Ernestus and Moritz von Oswald—the press-shy individuals eventually revealed as the artists behind the alias—would carry throughout their careers. The track, like others including “Q1.1/I” and “Octagon,” was heavily inspired by Detroit techno, taking influence from Juan Atkins, Jeff Mills, Robert Hood, and labels like Metroplex and Underground Resistance. This scene was the blueprint from which Basic Channel would establish—and perfect—a completely new sound of their own. To purists both then—a period when techno’s sprawling nightlife network was just beginning to coalesce against the backdrop of German reunification—and now, dub techno begins and ends with Basic Channel, whose 1995 compilation BCD remains the genre’s defining document. On first listen, it might be difficult to tell why the compilation is so revered. Gone is the adrenaline rush that defined early singles like “Enforcement” and “Phylyps Trak,” and in its place, studio effects like delay and reverb give the music a cold and distant feel. The forceful kicks of their early tracks have softened, slowed, and been submerged in the murk. The album includes cuts stretching as far back as “Lyot Remix,” their third vinyl single, but in keeping with Basic Channel’s fondness for endless deception, the album is neither a collection of original material nor a chronological anthology of their vinyl singles. Three exclusive tracks—in some cases, heavily dubbed-out versions of earlier singles—share space with truncated edits of EP tracks that originally stretched as long as 21 minutes; one track, a remix of a cut from Carl Craig’s Paperclip People project, has been rescued from the Detroit producer’s Planet E label and retconned as a Basic Channel original.The album’s sequencing reinforces the impression of a descent into abstraction. The rolling, mid-tempo groove of “Q Loop” eases into rippling textures with “Remake Basic Reshape,” where thin tones bounce endlessly across stereophonic space before dissolving into extended pulses of ASMR-inducing electrical noise for the nearly six-minute “Mutism.” The buoyant thump of “Quadrant Dub I” gradually hollows out over the course of the tracks that follow, approaching purely beatless waves of synth on “Presence.” Perhaps “Absence” would have been a better title; the track, like BCD as a whole, emphasizes Basic Channel’s output at its most spacious and minimal. In many ways, the album resembles ambient music, even if they come to the sound by way of Jamaican dub rather than Brian Eno (or, for that matter, the atmospheric sounds then pacifying the UK’s chillout rooms). The brilliance of Basic Channel lies in how naturally they applied the blunted studio techniques of Jamaican dub to electronic dance genres from the American Midwest. Dub innovators like King Tubby and Lee “Scratch” Perry spent the 1970s stripping reggae to its essence, taking Jamaica’s answer to rhythm & blues and reassembling it into new works. Made with massive sound systems in mind, these bass-heavy mixes used studio effects like tape echo, phaser, filter, and spring reverb, trading the band-centric feeling of reggae for a new approach to composition organized around the studio mixing console. “A dub mix is essentially the bare bones of a track with the bass turned up,” critics Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton write in their 1999 history of the disc jockey. “By adding space to a track, what is left has far more impact.” With this simple insight, Basic Channel changed techno forever. Across their initial run of singles, the duo steadily introduced various mixing techniques from Jamaican dub, revealing a new horizon for electronic music’s experimental vanguard. This shift is immediately evident on “Octagon”—anthologized not on BCD but on its follow-up, 2008’s BCD-2—where they slather a metallic snare sample with thick stereo delay, setting a rickety feedback loop into motion that ripples outward across stereophonic space. The dark chords and frenetic synth programming would become a staple of the Basic Channel sound, growing and evolving as their tracks move forward, repeating the same muted tones again and again. It isn’t hard to imagine the pair at the mixing console, manually sliding each fader responsible for the track’s deluge of moving parts. Studio effects, like the Roland RE-201 Space Echo so beloved by dub producers, lend a sense of spatial depth to “Remake Basic Reshape,” where shrill electronics rattle in perpetual motion over a simple kick and bassline. Ostensibly a remix (or, in their words, “reshape”) of a 25-minute epic called “Remake” from Paperclip People (which itself samples Göttsching’s E2-E4), the track exemplifies the way effects color practically every sound on the record. Brassy synth pulses emerge from behind a curtain of reverb on “Presence” to produce what sounds like a whirring engine turbine, while others, like “Lyot Remix” (a second pass through a cut from René Löwe’s Vainqueur project that the pair first reworked as Maurizio), bask in the uncertainty of each sound’s source material. Early synth designers may have once aspired to imitate the timbres of various acoustic instruments, but against a backdrop of widespread sampling practices and increasingly elaborate sound design, Basic Channel venture away from faithful reproductions of canonical synth patches or drum-machine samples in their explorations of the timbral and textural possibilities of dub. Mixes tend to build slowly, shifting and expanding in slight ways that are only evident with extended periods of careful listening. Some, like “Q1.1,” unfold like feedback loops, with effects that steadily rise in intensity as the track smolders and buckles beneath the weight of its moving parts. Others end closer to where they started; on “Quadrant Dub I,” the duo sets a few formal elements into motion before stepping back to let a sequence of clustered tones bob aimlessly in the mix. There’s a symmetry to the way the piece builds and recedes, but it’s distinctly performed by hand, worlds away from the kinds of automated, sequencer-centric phrasing that have long given house and techno tracks their functional cues for the dancefloor. Instead, the pair’s tracks more closely resemble sculptures or time-based installations, encouraging the kind of careful contemplation typically reserved for works in a gallery or museum. Basic Channel was never just a musical project, and to call the duo merely techno producers is to misunderstand their work in scale and scope. Ernestus and von Oswald touched every aspect of the musical supply chain throughout the 1980s and 1990s; before collaborating with Ernestus on projects like Basic Channel and Maurizio, von Oswald got his start as a percussionist with Hamburg’s Palais Schaumburg, an arty Neue Deutsche Welle (“New German Wave”) quartet that he co-founded with the Swiss composer and multi-instrumentalist Thomas Fehlmann in 1980. In 1989, Ernestus co-founded Hard Wax, a Kreuzberg record store that was among the first places in Berlin to import house and techno records from Detroit and Chicago. The pair also established a vinyl manufacturing facility called Dubplates & Mastering, and launched numerous record labels outside of Basic Channel including Chain Reaction, Burial Mix, and Rhythm & Sound. These labels released music from the constellation of artists surrounding Hard Wax, Tresor, and other techno institutions emerging across Berlin in the years following reunification. Ernestus and von Oswald were devoted archivists and fans of Detroit techno long before they ever produced collaborative tracks themselves; their work as Basic Channel represents two perfectionists’ attempt to bring the many sides of their sprawling research practice together on a series of air-tight releases. From the opening moments of their first vinyl single, everything about the project—from its beautiful packaging to the intricacies of the music itself—felt like a deliberate artistic intervention intended to upend inherited conventions and assert their own vision for techno as a kind of modernist avant-garde. The work inspired other producers, like Edward George and Anna Piva of Hallucinator, to experiment with dub techniques. And while Ernestus and von Oswald would release many of the strongest of these experiments on labels like Chain Reaction—the launchpad for a number of celebrated producers, including Porter Ricks, Monolake, Vladislav Delay, and Shinichi Atobe—the Basic Channel name was always reserved for their own forward-thinking work. “My impression is that Mark and Moritz are extremely aware of the difference in boundaries between different genres and styles, and they play with that and work with that,” Piva told Resident Advisor in 2018. “If anything, it’s really going deep into each form and looking at the as-yet explored possibilities within it to generate something new.” For all that Basic Channel got right, the project wasn’t without its missteps. Like its name suggests, BCD was a compilation intended for the compact disc format, which allowed the duo to gather 11 tracks together in ways that weren’t possible on vinyl. Still analog purists at heart (original copies of the CD came affixed with a sticker reading “buy vinyl!”), the duo took a chance on the format, presenting their work in a sleek aluminum case that was consistent with the visual language for their singles. But a design quirk of the metal boxes frequently cracked the discs, rendering them unplayable. “Nice idea and great music but flawed case,” a charitable commenter wrote on Discogs earlier this year. “Store the CD separately if you find one not cracked. Still, the packaging was beautiful and idiosyncratic in ways that were, ironically enough, fairly consistent with the music. Every track feels rough around the edges; feedback loops are as central to the release as any other sonic element, and reverb imparts a sense of space and depth that makes the tracks immediately recognizable in any DJ set. In terms of audio fidelity, BCD certainly isn’t a hi-fi release, but it also betrays the self-conscious use of lo-fi techniques adopted by others looking to achieve a nostalgic, homespun sound. Instead, the album’s fuzzy dub fidelity foregrounds the duo’s emphasis on process; like the pair’s vinyl singles, the compact disc serves as an extension of their creative practice. For much of the 20th century, concerns about audio fidelity were inseparable from the image of the recording studio, where ambitious engineers like Joe Meek and Phil Spector helped recast the studio as an instrument itself. Basic Channel make a similar contribution to global techno, placing the sci-fi visions of artists like Juan Atkins (who famously adopted the word “techno” from the futurist writer Alvin Toffler) within novel studio environments that gave new color and texture to the music. Whether due to their outsider status as international observers, or to some genuine burst of artistic insight, Ernestus and von Oswald recognized a line that could be drawn between the sounds of Detroit, Chicago, and Jamaica. This spirit would extend beyond their work as Basic Channel, overflowing onto labels Chain Reaction and Rhythm & Sound, where they released work from the international artists whose influence they drew on in their productions. BCD marks the beginning of Basic Channel’s efforts to make their singular aesthetic universe legible to outside listeners. For every teenager who wasn’t there in person, who couldn’t tell the difference between Cyrus and Quadrant and Maurizio—whether in record bins or on Soulseek—the compilation offers a way in to the duo’s catalog, which would achieve legendary status on par with the discographies of Autechre and Aphex Twin in the coming years.

    "    {\"Date\": \"2024-09-14\", \"Artist\": \"Travis Scott\", \"Album\": \"Days Before Rodeo\", \"Genre\": \"Rap\", \"Text\": 'The 10th anniversary edition of Days Before Rodeo, Travis Scott’s breakout mixtape, is a time capsule of the rapper’s chameleonic production prowess and budding curatorial skill. In the dwindling months of summer 2014, Travis Scott’s obsession with curation began to take shape in the public eye. A few days before his mixtape Days Before Rodeo (a teaser for his official debut, Rodeo) hit SoundCloud on August 18, Metro Boomin posted a behind-the-scenes video chronicling the making of Travis and Young Thug’s song “Skyfall.” Between frenetic camera cuts, you’re treated to shots of Travis and Metro piecing together “Skyfall” as smoke billows in the background. Scott bounces between playful exuberance and meticulous micromanagement, imploring engineer Alex Tumay to remove drums and adjust bass levels, all under the watchful eye of the camera. It’s not unreasonable to think of Days Before Rodeo as the linchpin for Travis Scott’s massive success. He wanted to be a star; if his next move had been a misfire, he might have had to settle for a spot in the middle of the pack. The 10-year anniversary deluxe edition of Days Before Rodeo, available on streaming and vinyl for the first time in a decade with a slew of new tracks, is a time capsule of Scott’s chameleonic production prowess and his budding curatorial skill, even as it begins to reveal the penchant for vapid spectacle that would lead him astray. By the time Scott’s buzzy 2013 debut mixtape Owl Pharaoh arrived, his career felt as though it just needed one final push to get over the hump. He’d already secured co-signs from Kanye West and T.I., earning touted placements as an in-house producer for G.O.O.D. Music (credits on Yeezus’ “Guilt Trip” and “New Slaves,” with lingering speculation that Scott was a catalyst behind the album’s angsty tonal shift). He lent his talents to Jay-Z’s Magna Carta, Holy Grail and Wale’s The Gifted. By virtue of association, Scott had strapped on the proverbial jetpack. Those simmering expectations boil over on the growled refrain of Days Before Rodeo opener “The Prayer”: “I might fuck ’round lose my mind, I gotta break out,” he raps, making the act of saying grace sound more like a warning shot. Compared to later releases, Days Before Rodeo is an exercise in restraint, lacking an extensive list of lyrical features (but full of production assists from FKi 1st, Metro Boomin, and Lex Luger). Still, the tape hits clear highs when Scott rolls out the red carpet for more capable rappers. The marriage between blistering hi-hats and spaghetti Western samples make “Mamacita” feel as though Young Thug and the late Rich Homie Quan are gallivanting through a gunfight at the O.K. Corral, with Scott trailing behind. “Skyfall” sets up a brilliant contrast between Scott’s baritone hums and Thug’s piercing raps, coming off as a slow march to desolation accompanied by play-by-play from vengeful spirits. “Sloppy Toppy,” a spiritual precursor to epic Rodeo collaborations “3500” and “Nightcrawler,” remains the platonic ideal for when Scott’s grand plans come together. Teeing it off with an expertly chopped 1977 Edna Wright sample (produced by FKi 1st and Mike Dean), Scott assembles Migos and Peewee Longway, some of the era’s greatest Atlanta rappers, for a deliriously raunchy joyride that always seems on the verge of veering off the cliff. It’s a posse cut that wouldn’t have sounded out of place on Migos’ No Label II. Here, Scott is more akin to the coach of the Showtime Lakers, tasked only with bridging the gap, pushing the right buttons to position more talented lyricists to succeed. He doesn’t always need help from guests: On “Drugs You Should Try It,” arguably the mixtape’s summit, Scott embarks on his version of an emotive ballad, yearning for the numbing effects of substances over FKi 1st’s murky, downtempo production. “I try it if it feels right/This feels nice/I’ve been down and lost for days/Glad I found you on the way,” his raps, his distorted voice eking it way out over the lush guitar composition. The words feel raw, even though he isn’t saying much—a balance that’s a lot easier to strike as a regular guy than it is as a larger-than-life superstar. But the longer stretches where Scott flies solo on Days Before Rodeo were early evidence that, as a rapper, he generally shouldn’t be left to his own devices. If it weren’t for the intoxicating thrill ride “Backyard,” where his vocals turn the track from a party into a rager, the second half of the project would feel like a slog through harmless, sophomoric boasts. Already on Days Before Rodeo, it feels like Scott is more focused on executing big swings than he is in the more tedious process of coming up with important or interesting things to say. The new edition’s five bonus tracks—all previously unreleased cuts from that era—aren’t appointment viewing. “Yeah Yeah” is a welcome chance to experience another wildly fun Thug appearance; otherwise, it’s strictly fan service. Perhaps while revisiting Days Before Rodeo, your attention returned to that “Skyfall” behind-the-scenes video. It’s astounding that the clip exists, a mythical shot that almost morphs into a self-fulfilling prophecy of Scott’s trip to the stratosphere. It’s representative of the rapper’s ongoing obsession with creating a ubiquitous moment in pop culture, a historic clip that makes fans imagine that they “had to be there.” Days Before Rodeo wasn’t played off phone speakers in high-school hallways and dingy frat basements solely because it was stocked with bangers and true hits. The tape found its audience because Scott’s evident hunger inspired its own kind of FOMO: The bandwagon had arrived. Could you jump on before it was too late?', \"Score\": 7.7},\n",
    "    {\"Date\": \"2024-09-13\", \"Artist\": \"Floating Points\", \"Album\": \"Cascade\", \"Genre\": \"Electronic\", \"Text\": 'Three years after exploring new dimensions in ambient jazz alongside Pharoah Sanders, Sam Shepherd refocuses his efforts on the dancefloor, with dazzling results. In 2014, Sam Shepherd wrote a career-defining tune in a matter of minutes. “Nuits Sonores” was finished on a flight to the Lyon festival of the same name, and it sounds as effortless as it apparently was, climbing towards the heavens without boiling over into excess. This is one of Shepherd’s two main modes—when he’s not a jazz auteur, he’s a crack house and techno producer. (He also has a PhD in neuroscience and is a revered and adventurous selector behind the decks.) That other side has won him fame from all corners of the music industry, culminating in Promises, his 2021 collaboration with Pharoah Sanders. More recently, he’s been taking to huge festival stages with crossover DJs like Caribou and Four Tet, following them in their quests to infiltrate the mainstream on their own terms. All those parts of Floating Points are connected, but not always obviously. Enter Cascade, an album that bolsters Shepherd’s club cunning with his musical chops in service of one single-minded mission: blissing out on the dance floor. The rollout for Cascade started back in 2022 with “Vocoder,” an industrial-strength anthem to file alongside “Nuits Sonores” and 2019’s “LesAlpx.” “Vocoder (Club Mix)” opens the album in a boisterous rush, careening toward a breakdown of clipped vocal samples that spill out like a cargo of french fries from a turned-over semi. It’s nearly reckless by Floating Points standards, capturing that feeling when the strobes hit hard and you can’t tell if the lights are getting to you or you’re just more faded than you thought. The raucous album is a direct sequel to 2019’s aggressive Crush. On that record, Shepherd showcased his newfound mastery of modular synthesis, creating cresting waves of fuzz and distortion that bore down on fitful rhythms and unpredictable song structures—the result, he said, of opening huge venues for the xx and wanting to challenge the audience with “chaotic” music. This time he’s focused on making people move instead of befuddling them. Cascade is what happened when Shepherd wasn’t able to tour at all, an exorcism of dancefloor impulses impeded by the pandemic and then nurtured by the return of DJ gigs. In the midst of recording it, he decamped to the Southern California desert to write the score for a ballet, which makes Cascade a holiday and a reckoning all in one. These tracks redirect the jazzy vamp of classic records like Shadows into zig-zagging journeys, like those ’90s screen-saver mazes. The approach peaks with centerpiece “Fast Forward,” where jittery synth leads wrap around each other like a hissing Medusa head of countermelodies and surging textures. The melodies decay and detune in real time, highlighting Shepherd’s handiwork—electronic music you can practically hear breathing, growing, and dying. “Afflecks Palace” takes this idea and throws a swirl of conflicting emotions at it. A nostalgic trip through early IDM, acid house, and jungle, it’s wiry and unpredictable, held together with a thin thread thanks to Shepherd’s now considerable experience making this kind of stuff on the fly. There are softer moments, too. “Key103” wouldn’t sound out of place in a Maceo Plex set, with melancholy synths weighing down the otherwise springy drums, wax hardening around the joints. Standout “Ocotillo” features harpist Miriam Adefris and Shepherd playing his great aunt’s Clavichord to miniature music-box “Dueling Banjos” effect, full of gleaming nylon strings and fluttering, heart-in-mouth vocals. It conjures Four Tet with Shepherd’s typical musical precision. The closing suite of “Tilt Shift” and “Ablaze” starts out with sputtering IDM drums, but a doleful melody takes over along with wordless vocals from Hikaru Utada, the J-pop legend whose 2022 comeback album Shepherd co-produced. Moments like these—Utada’s presence on Cascade, live musicians elsewhere, superstar DJ friends—underline how far Shepherd has come since he was playing at Plastic People in London and being bashful about his career in neuroscience, as if it were something to be embarrassed about. Now all parts of Shepherd are on display, the scientist-DJ-producer-jazz-musician who can have his cake and eat it, too. Cascade’s focus on straight-up dance music might feel jarring compared to his other albums. I briefly, foolishly took “Vocoder” as Shepherd’s sell-out moment, but heard in the context of the five-hour Boiler Room set that Shepherd streamed to celebrate Cascade, it made sense in the context of the Brazilian disco and songs from Floating Points staples like Stevie Wonder. These tracks aren’t far removed from the curling grooves of “Vacuum Boogie” or “People’s Potential,” and they flow with an unstoppable energy that channels the spontaneous inspiration of “Nuits Sonores.” While he’s often lauded for his meticulousness, Cascade shows that Shepherd—whether in the studio, on stage, or cruising at 30,000 feet—is a master of winging it.', \"Score\": 8.0},\n",
    "    {\"Date\": \"2024-09-13\", \"Artist\": \"Allegra Krieger\", \"Album\": \"Art of the Unseen Infinity Machine\", \"Genre\": \"Folk/Country\", \"Text\": 'The singer-songwriter completed her new album after a brush with death, filling her airy folk-rock with poetic urgency, empathetic curiosity, and a renewed respect for life. New York singer-songwriter Allegra Krieger isn’t speaking in hypotheticals when she tethers two questions together in “One or the Other”: “What do you know about living? What do you know about dying?” Late at night last summer, while Krieger was fast asleep on the fifth floor of her Chinatown apartment, several lithium batteries combusted in the e-bike shop down below. She awoke to banging on her door and, through a disorienting haze of gray smoke, couldn’t unlock the fire escape. So she held her breath, sprinted down the main stairwell instead, and, as the flames spread upwards, slipped and fell. By the grace of a God she only partially believes in, a fireman spotted her and carried her outside; Krieger made it out alive. Her second floor neighbor, Nancy, did not. The bulk of Art of the Unseen Infinity Machine, Krieger’s fifth album, was finished before the building fire, but the stark perspective offered by her escape and the experience of being rehomed in a new neighborhood accelerated its final songwriting sessions. Looming over its 13 tracks of airy folk-rock are questions of impermanence, purpose, and gratitude. Though survivor’s guilt hangs heavy on “One or the Other,” Krieger walks away from the trauma with renewed respect for life. From the sunny harmonies of “Roosevelt Ave” to the love-soaked glee radiating from “I’m So Happy I Cannot Face Tomorrow,” the 28-year-old musician strolls around the city with wonderment in her songs; her ability to make that feeling contagious while still acknowledging life’s pitfalls is a reflection of her musical prowess. Her new album comes barely a year after her last, 2023’s I Keep My Feet on the Fragile Plane, and Krieger’s ability to beautifully retell—but not romanticize—her struggles so soon after they happen is partially a result of her waning faith. After finding purpose in the Catholicism on which she was raised, Krieger discovered a similarly rewarding community in the music world and began to drift from her religion. Like gripping a rosary in her palm during prayer, Krieger’s songwriting on Art of the Unseen Infinity Machine uses physicality to expel pain through repetition and confession: the spindly guitar that prods rhythmically in “Into Eternity,” creaks of solemn piano during the album’s wordless interlude, a fuzz pedal dampening the guitar runs in “How Do You Sleep” as she sings of shame. The louder her blend of folk and indie rock gets, the darker its overall effect becomes. Enrolling in odd jobs around the country as a young adult—farming in North Carolina, staffing a roadside motel in California, planting trees in Georgia—taught her to appreciate time off spent reading. A disciple of Anne Carson and Clarice Lispector, Krieger sings with the poetic cadence and mysterious edge of those she admires. She wrestles with detachment in “Never Arriving,” keeping specifics just at bay enough for the song to be about sex, or technology, or desensitization. Even when she breaks into a Wednesday-worthy scream during the lusty “Came,” she pins up her lyrics with elegant descriptions of midnight humidity and gas station alcohol. More recently, Krieger’s been working as a gregarious bartender in New York, and it’s from this experience—the direct pipeline to a rotating cast of characters and their late-night divulgences—that she extracted the compassionate revelations about human nature that populate her songs. People want connection, security, and comfort within their own bodies. Art of the Unseen Infinity Machine toasts the small things—smiling cashiers, ocean spray hitting legs—that aid our quest to achieve those, while denoting the universal roadblocks, too. “Remind me again,” she sings on “Burning Wings” like she’s wiping a pint glass dry. “What are you doing here anyways?” The poetic urgency and freeform looseness that define Art of the Unseen Infinity Machine dovetail with introspection. When patterns emerge in Krieger’s observations, she sounds like an unsuspecting soothsayer. “If you don’t like the way that it’s going/Then maybe just sit back and wait/For the sky to come crashing over in the blink of an eye,” she advises in “Where You Want to Go,” a rustic, fingerpicked song in the vein of Nick Drake. As if to prove that point, the song ends with a bonafide guitar solo. Krieger knows life can be upended in a second. Five albums in, she’s figured out how to come to terms with that.', \"Score\": 7.5},\n",
    "    {\"Date\": \"2024-09-13\", \"Artist\": \"Masayoshi Fujita\", \"Album\": \"Migratory\", \"Genre\": \"Experimental\", \"Text\": 'Through tranquil reverberations of vibraphone and shō, the Japanese experimental composer contemplates the restless urges that inspire birds (and humans) to take flight. Birds possess a geographic intuition to make any cartographer weep. Year after year, migratory species travel thousands of miles, returning to the same nests with near-centimeter precision. Scientists believe our feathered friends are blessed with a specialized magnetoreceptor capable of reading Earth’s electromagnetic fields like a compass—fields so weak they couldn’t stick a magnet to your fridge. Masayoshi Fujita’s vibraphone is an equally uncanny organ, subtle and precise. Across Migratory his metallophone swells and swoops as if it too would like to ride the squalls and siroccos. Alternating between percussive spirals and languorous sound baths, Migratory refuses to flatten into ambient wallpaper, directing your ear to landmarks hundreds of miles underwing. “Desonata” twinkles and undulates like a softly expanding galaxy; “Pale Purple” plinks syncopated countermelodies against a wall of bowed dirges. These songs are deliberate but not meditative, more interested in depiction than reflection. Fujita guides listeners through lush and sparse terrain, equally likely to illustrate a placid lake or a sun-soaked field as a jagged mountain or arid badlands. Sometimes these landscapes can be shrouded, indistinct: “Distant Planet” traces a spare melody but feels almost too empty. At the other extreme, Moor Mother’s spoken-word performance on “Our Mother’s Lights” gilds the lily, stuffing one idea too many into the album’s most dynamic track; the texture of her ad-libs doesn’t quite make up for an anticlimactic stretch of free-associative writing. Despite the minor misfires, Migratory carves out its own contemplative niche, widening the scope of Fujita’s work through careful layering. Take “Higurashi,” featuring Hokkaido-via-London vocalist and composer Hatis Noit, which opens with a field recording of the titular cicadas. So closely does Noit’s tender vocal seem to mimic the rich tones of the vibraphone that, for the first two minutes, you nearly forget that Fujita hasn’t hit a note. When he finally enters, quiet as rustling leaves, it feels like a gentle exhale. Closer to earth, Mattias Hållsten teases out free reed disharmonies with the shō on three tracks including “Yodaka,” and Fujita’s father contributes saxophone. Fujita senior’s evocative brass undergirds Fujita junior’s headier ideas, stabilizing the fluttery “Blue Rock Thrush” and tethering “In a Sunny Meadow” via mournful topline. The collaborations widen Fujita’s palette, adding contrast and depth of field to his vibraphonic vistas. On one level, Migratory is a snapshot of Masayoshi Fujita’s own repatriation: After 13 years living in Berlin, the artist returned to his native Japan in 2020, living and recording amid the coastal hills of Kami-cho, Hyōgo. But on another, the album taps into an animal zugunruhe, that innate feeling telling us to spread our wings and go. Migratory balances this restlessness with an equanimous serenity unruffled by the gales, confident that Fujita’s scrupulous hand will catch the next updraft.', \"Score\": 7.7},\n",
    "    {\"Date\": \"2024-09-12\", \"Artist\": \"Max Richter\", \"Album\": \"In A Landscape\", \"Genre\": \"Experimental\", \"Text\": 'The German composer reflects on his many years of music-making with a subtle, melancholic suite of songs that looks back to move forward. Over the last two decades, Max Richter has perfected the art of writing lovely and intimate instrumental music, indebted to Brian Eno, Philip Glass, and Romantic era classical alike. Since the release of his debut Memoryhouse in 2002 and the landmark The Blue Notebooks in 2004, the German-born composer’s brand of tonal, postminimalist composition has dominated the classical scene, with labels like New Amsterdam Records and Bedroom Community championing and furthering the crossover classical ethos. For his part, Richter has basically become a popstar, claiming more than a billion streams to his name and a slew of big-ticket film and television scores. Now, he’s reflecting on these years of music making, looking back to move forward. Released 20 years after The Blue Notebooks, In a Landscape returns Richter to the themes that have made his career with a heavy dose of nostalgia. And while his compositional style functions like a well-oiled machine, In a Landscape shows that there’s still room to evolve by exploring the darkness that churns within his gentle music. Though on its surface Richter’s music is nearly too pretty, it has often been used to soundtrack the ills of society. His film and television scores have served as the backdrop to shows like Black Mirror, while he wrote The Blue Notebooks in protest of the Iraq War. With In a Landscape, he alludes to the polarity of our time and how his lovely music may offer some solace, or space, to contemplate it. But where his other music never strays too far from lightness, here he explores the more melancholy side of his practice, unearthing the uncertainty hiding behind even the most pleasant moments. Throughout, Richter’s melodies slope into downtrodden chords to create a darkened atmosphere. He often starts his compositions with simple phrases of just a few notes that glide down, moving at a leisurely andante and in uneven, unsteady steps. He shrouds each of these plodding phrases with a hint of reverb and ends most of his pieces on a solemn minor chord, languishing in each note. Take opener “They Will Shade Us With Their Wings,” for example, which features a melody in which the second note is accented, not the first, like a long, tired sigh after a sharp breath. This structure gives Richter’s music its pensiveness. “A Colour Field (Holocene)” blossoms from a five-note phrase whose off-kilter motion builds tension with each repetition, creating a hint of dissonance while maintaining his music’s signature charm. “The Poetry of Earth (Geophony)” grows from a couplet of four-note piano melodies, gradually adding in romantic strings that burst and swirl around them. Between these compositions lie recordings of everyday life, like the ambiance of cafes, footsteps, or birds. Though nothing new in the world of field recordings, in the context of In a Landscape, they offer a poignant break to remember the small moments that have already passed. Because Richter’s formula is so honed, it can become difficult to differentiate each piece as the album progresses. Was that the same baroque melody that appeared on “And Some Will Fall,” just transposed? Richter’s approach is almost too cut-and-dry; there’s none of the messiness that comes with processing emotion or the tension and release that defines catharsis. But closer “Movement, Before all Flowers” offers a welcome surprise. The song appears with airiness, turning the album’s leaden minor chords into something buoyant. A cello soars above oscillating piano like a shining light pointing the way back to shore. It’s Richter’s music at its most hopeful, emerging from the wreckage into something even more beautiful.', \"Score\": 7.3},\n",
    "    {\"Date\": \"2024-09-12\", \"Artist\": \"Fat Dog\", \"Album\": \"WOOF.\", \"Genre\": \"Rock\", \"Text\": 'The UK’s latest post-punk export has built its rep on antic live shows and costumed hijinks. But on record, Fat Dog’s arch dance-punk fusion feels more calculated than provocatively chaotic. When Fat Dog, the UK’s latest post-punk export, hopped on tour with Viagra Boys last year, they enraged a few fans riding hard for the headliner. “We got a lot of hate from people because they didn’t want to see the support act ‘out-do’ anyone,” Fat Dog frontman Joe Love explained to NME this spring. Fuming that the South London five-piece were punching above their weight, one dissatisfied concertgoer accused Love of being “arrogant,” calling him “a tiny little prick,” as Fat Dog keyboardist Chris Hughes remembered. I’ve never seen Fat Dog live, but their reputation as performers has made its way into every published piece on the band. It’s what attracted their devoted following (who reportedly call themselves “the Kennel”), and landed them a record deal with Domino even before releasing their first single. Loyal to their rabid fanbase, Fat Dog let the Kennel select the initial track they recorded for Domino: a seven-minute thumper called “King of the Slugs” that came out last summer. Like most of the songs on Fat Dog’s debut album, WOOF., “King of the Slugs” is a hybrid strain of hard rock and EDM, blown-out bass and revving synths lurching into tweaked klezmer-techno. Often filtered through reverb, Love’s blunt and grizzled vocals recall bullish forebears like Idles and Fat White Family. In April, Fat Dog played “King of the Slugs” to a packed house at Electric Brixton, a 1,500 capacity venue in South London—the same part of town that’s birthed post-punk revivalists like Shame, Dry Cleaning, and Goat Girl in recent years. Footage from the show captures the crowd pogoing in unison as Love waves a white cowboy hat over them like a rodeo preacher. Behind him, drummer John Hutchinson sweats beneath his rubber dog mask, its jaw agape and tongue spilling out the front. Much fanfare has been made of the costumes and hijinks, and the audience is going batshit—but Love seems a bit joyless and contained, like he doesn’t quite believe in the product he’s peddling. That same sense of detachment is smudged across WOOF., mucking up the surface with its dull, grayish residue. Bemoaning rock’s cerebral turn, Love formed Fat Dog in 2021 with a batch of demos he’d made during lockdown. The band’s mandate: to make fun, ridiculous music. Something people could dance or thrash to. Hughes, Hutchinson, bassist Ben Harris, and woodwind player Morgan Wallace helped shape Love’s source material into zany bruisers with punk heft and club tempos. But despite the flatulent sax bursts and Love’s occasionally jagged howl, WOOF. feels decidedly un-fun, more like a series of cynical decisions looped on repeat. Throughout the album, Fat Dog seem to ask: Wouldn’t it be funny if we put violin, viola, and cello on our kind-of punk album? What if we had a track with Auto-Tune, and one that name-checks the Karate Kid sequel? What if we bookend everything with moody monologues recited by our hype man, character actor Neil Bell? What if electro-polka? What if clarinet? It all carries the whiff of staged eccentricity. The songs are too long and often repeat large slabs of lyrics to no memorable effect other than filling space. For the most part, Love’s delivery feels flat, bored, and macho, making his comic verses curdle into pissy screeds, as on “Clowns”: You are what you eat now, baby You’re shit to me I died a thousand times now, now all I see Crackheads to the left And clowns to the right I’m falling down the stairs No jiggy for me tonight Some small details capture the ruckus Fat Dog were aiming for. The thick, tendony bass on “Wither” is excellent. “All the Same” kicks off with a lubed-rubber synth line that smacks of early Nine Inch Nails. But the production often feels too trimmed and clean. The cresting strings on “I Am the King,” the pitched-up, crystalline backing vocals on “Clown,” and Love’s largely scuff-free voice don’t suit the material or capture the alleged force of Fat Dog’s live act. “When you’re releasing stuff to a big audience, the best you can hope for is that 50% of people love it and 50% of people hate it,” Chris Hughes said in an interview with DIY last year, his face coated in gold paint. “If people just have a lukewarm response then what’s the point?” Unfortunately, Fat Dog’s debut slumps right in that tepid puddle, weighed down by gimmicks, cheap irony, and unearned mythology. Rather than stoking rapture or rage, it prods with hollow indifference. More a whimper than a woof.', \"Score\": 5.7},\n",
    "    {\"Date\": \"2024-09-11\", \"Artist\": \"Nala Sinephro\", \"Album\": \"Endlessness\", \"Genre\": \"Jazz/Experimental\", \"Text\": 'The London-based musician’s potent and intuitive second album dissolves the binaries inherent in ambient jazz and imagines a third sort of music that thrives at their midpoint. Endlessness, Nala Sinephro’s second record, centers on an arpeggio. The London-based composer modulates this ascendant phrase, extends it, plays it more lento, and lets it slip into inaudibility and disappear. It carries us like a rip tide through the album’s 10 tracks, all called “Continuum”—a perfect name for each, though this LP isn’t a series of variations on a single composition. Listen closely, and its details transform at a relentless clip. Let your mind drift, and its 45 minutes resemble a lake: broad, serene, consistent if never flat. The 28-year-old, raised on the outskirts of Brussels by a Belgian mother and a father with roots in Martinique and Guadeloupe, has both ambient music’s cool breeze and jazz’s strong winds at her back. She emerged as the union of these genres was finally losing its hyphen, during the COVID-marooned days of 2021. Floating Points and Pharoah Sanders’ Promises arrived in March, an event that paired the electronic perfectionist on the same bill as the elder-statesman saxophonist, along with the London Symphony Orchestra. Sinephro’s sparkling debut, Space 1.8, dropped in September of the same year, as though she knew a mantle was waiting to be taken up. She had recorded the disc in 2018 and 2019, but that only made her arrival more uncanny—when was the last time that a couple of jazz records, put out mere months apart, seemed to be talking to each other, disagreeing, finding common ground, and cogitating over a future for the form? Still, Sinephro scopes out the frontier. Endlessness dissolves the binaries that define ambient jazz and imagines a third sort of music that thrives at their midpoint. Its seamlessness distinguishes Sinephro’s second album from its still excellent predecessor, which was alternately atmospheric and bluesy. This is more cohesive, more elegant. Endlessness merges sensibilities with the naturalness of DNA strands bonding into a double helix. It both proves ambient jazz’s endurance and renders the two terms mutually redundant. Sinephro has grown considerably as a studio brain and bandleader in the last five years. She produced and mixed every song on Endlessness, engineering them with collaborator Rick David. She also arranged all of the record’s strings—never saccharine or maudlin, they feel poignant and as judicious as any other instrumental feature. Sinephro plays harp, piano, and synths both modular and otherwise alongside a who’s who of friends from South London’s jazz scene. Endlessness’ soul is the energy of the session, the ability of musicians in a room to swap ideas in real time. The work begins with a tight combo clocking in: Sinephro signals the start with multiple synth parts, Black Midi’s Morgan Simpson adds his drums, and Ezra Collective’s James Mollison jumps in on saxophone. The bandstand expands on the next cut—Endlessness feels auteur-ish thanks not only to Sinephro’s masterminding, but because musicians constantly replace each other, slipping like samples through her deft production. Lyle Barton accompanies on synth, offering a whorling lead part on “Continuum 3”; UK torchbearer Nubya Garcia’s sax sets a spark as “Continuum 5” turns to “Continuum 6”; Dwayne Kilvington lays down sparing synth bass, stabilizing an LP that nearly entirely forgoes any four-stringed foundation; Natcyet Wakili, known for his timekeeping with Sons of Kemet, subs in on percussion; Sheila Maurice-Gray purrs away on flugelhorn and trumpet. Endlessness’ pristine exterior hardly conceals the generative buzz of Sinephro’s players, who give the collection both breadth and persistent gusts of fresh air. Her easy-come-easy-go ensemble labors against the composer’s production like swimmers battling a current. The pulse she offers at the start soon becomes an invitation to challenge its boundaries. Simpson’s tumbling drumwork rejects the arpeggio only minutes into “Continuum 1,” taking control of duration, stretching it like putty, before he passes it back to Sinephro and the track reorients itself. Meanwhile, synthesizers pluck away like Sinephro’s own harp. The concoction eventually reduces to a sax line so intimate and unadorned that you can hear the pads clack against the brass. Elsewhere, Sinephro reroutes the pulse herself. “Continuum 7” shifts momentum when she slows the arpeggio, transposes it, and buttresses the ostinato with a descending response to its call. For a glorious moment, we’re suspended as though inside of our own vascular systems, watching as little particles of modular synth and chordophone float by us. The drums lock into the central groove again midway through “Continuum 8” and the group hits its stride, loping forth in jaunty lockstep. Orchestration blows open the music’s sense of space. “Continuum 2” is a simmering jam turned strange when a noise emanates like vintage technology trying to mimic the sound of a deflating balloon. Then the band loosens, the strings well up; Sinephro’s harp later trickles to the fore, a trip from delicate to robust and back that lingers long after Endlessness concludes. Even when the strings seem to accent the arrangements, as on “Continuum 3,” they move with melodic purpose, their entrances and exits dramatic and without emotional prescription. Endlessness invites us to feel but never tells us what our feelings should be. The LP has the potential to be a relaxed listen if you welcome this side of its personality, but it’s also vast and complicated. In the dwindling seconds of “Continuum 9,” Mollison sounds a strained note from his tenor. The gesture is fleeting, succinct, and speaks at once to the album’s epic scale and sense of understatement.

    "    {\"Date\": \"2024-09-11\", \"Artist\": \"Dummy\", \"Album\": \"Free Energy\", \"Genre\": \"Rock\", \"Text\": 'On its second album, the Los Angeles band levels up its dizzying dynamic shifts and emphasizes Emma Maatman’s expressive voice. The result is a record of expertly crafted psych-pop that’s thrillingly kinetic and unbound. In thermodynamics, “free energy” is a measure of available power and spontaneity, how much potential heat and spark can be unleashed in the space of a reaction. Even if it might initially give you some pause to take a physics lesson from a group called Dummy, it’s an apt metaphor for the creative alchemy on the Los Angeles band’s second full-length album. Hard-won originality and explosive release are central to the group’s appeal; its songs are endlessly evocative yet utterly distinct. On Free Energy, Dummy have distilled their influences into music that’s as free-floating and airy as it is scorchingly combustible, weaving pummeling shoegaze guitar, dissonant electronics, and serene pockets of jazzy ambience into expertly crafted psych-pop. Dummy’s wide-ranging sound reflects a rigorous study and synthesis of their wildly eclectic forebears: My Bloody Valentine by way of Laraaji, Stereolab by way of The Byrds. Even at their most joyfully immediate, Dummy take a perverse glee in emphasizing just how easy their music isn’t: “Making music shouldn’t be fun” is the group’s long-time Bandcamp bio, never mind that they called their debut Mandatory Enjoyment. This deadpan-dourness is both a long-running joke and a reminder that the originality the band yields is no accident but a product of highly disciplined work. Where the greatness of Mandatory Enjoyment was in how successfully the group collaged its influences, on Free Energy, Dummy succeeds in burning away those raw edges altogether, resulting in an unbound sound that’s unmistakably their own. Free Energy is a record of altered states made incredibly fun and navigable. Dummy’s songwriting is cryptic and fragmentary, grappling from moment to moment with turbulent emotions as they blaze to the fore. There’s traces of the same meta cleverness that defined their last LP, especially on “Unshaped Road” which dramatizes the thrill and exhaustion of indie rockers: “Empty pockets feel pure…Feeling the weight/Begging for more each day/Come find me/Haven’t had enough yet.” But more often, the songs are multicolor free-falls into dreamy or unsettling landscapes. Many of the titles are drawn (Grimes-like) from advanced physics and niche video game references, which give the impression of cohesive, if bizarro, world-building. “Minus World,” for instance, is a study of dawning panic that, if looked at sideways, also doubles as a first person-account of being stranded in the infamous Super Mario Bros. glitch level. This dislocation is reinforced by the thrilling instability of the music itself. “Unshaped Road” pulls a production trick worthy of Kevin Shields, building the song out over a bruising bass tone that gradually tilts off its axis until the only accompaniment to Alex Ewell’s athletic drumming is a squall of roaring feedback. In “Nullspace,” Joe Trainor’s hard-driving guitar riff is made to surf over rubbery synths that sound like a cartoon character perpetually slipping on an oil slick. Like a hypnotist’s cue, the recurrence of a pinging synth loop on “Soonish…” prompts the band to rage and recede on cue. Dummy’s earlier work could impressively modulate between spacy ambience and blistering noise; on Free Energy, they ride these dizzying dynamic shifts even more wildly and gracefully. Like scientists working with volatile materials, the band demonstrates a firm understanding of the limits a pop song can tolerate as they segue from turbulence to tranquility and back again. “Sudden Flutes” lives up to its name, and after a frenzied attack, the song cleaves in two, shifting from hard-charging rock to a beatific instrumental courtesy of Cole Pulice. With “Blue Dada” and “Psychic Battery,” the group conjures a woozy lushness reminiscent of acts like Seefeel and Bowery Electric, a sonic bubble bath compared to the instrumental violence elsewhere. On “Dip in the Lake,” which recalls Disco Inferno and is easily a contender for Dummy’s most beautiful song to date, Nathan O’Dell sings of marveling at a lover’s face through flickering piano samples and gentle guitar work as though he were catching it from gorgeous new angles in the sunlight. O’Dell’s suave, affectless voice is perfectly at home on the record’s more psychedelic songs. But Emma Maatman’s vocals are the real standout on Free Energy, and one of the band’s most successful adjustments is pushing her gorgeous, expressive tone to the fore. While O’Dell coolly surfs the music, she embodies all of its vaporous tension: by turns stoic, wistful, pissed-off, and wonder-struck, yet always commanding. Maatman created the record’s cover art, inspired by lyrics written from the perspective of a woman seeking emotional clarity in an unstable relationship. As the band builds to an ecstatic peak on “Blue Dada,” she cries, “All the answers I’ve been seeking/It shines through/Kaleidoscope behind a burst balloon.” It’s the sound of a band turning all its potential energy into music that’s dazzlingly kinetic and powerful.

    "    {\"Date\": \"2024-09-11\", \"Artist\": \"Toro y Moi\", \"Album\": \"Hole Erth\", \"Genre\": \"Electronic\", \"Text\": 'Chaz Bear has been on the periphery of emo-rap since 24kGoldn was in kindergarten. But the crowded, blown-out Hole Erth struggles to sound like anything but an imitation. Chillwave may have come and gone, but its woozy footprints are everywhere: lofi hip-hop beats, Tame Impala’s continued dominance as a festival headliner, the endless barrage of shapeless AI synth tracks floating through Spotify like a garbage island in the Pacific. Disconnected from the actual talent of its OG practitioners, the scene that Chaz Bear (né Bundick) came up through as Toro y Moi has found real staying power in the current ecosystem of inoffensive, ambiguously jazz/funk/ambient sounds engineered for Maximum Vibe Wattage. Any indie act who’s stuck around as long as Toro y Moi must adapt, and in addition to dipping his toe into disco and indie rock and ambient, Bear has expanded to working with mainstream collaborators like Flume and Travis Scott. His new Toro y Moi project, Hole Erth, is a reference to the esoteric counterculture magazine Whole Earth Catalog, which Steve Jobs once referred to as a “paperback Google.” But while the hip-hop and pop-punk inspirations that Bear draws on for this album may have dominated the mid-2000s culture he came up in, they arrive on Hole Erth having already overstayed their welcome. Unlike his 2015 Samantha mixtape, where Bear experimented with R&B samples and features from Kool A.D. and Rome Fortune to arrive at a unique atmospheric sound, Hole Erth struggles to sound like anything but an imitation. It’s hard to fault Bear for trying out emo-rap when he’s been on the periphery of both since 24kGoldn was in kindergarten. But therein lies the problem: He’s now 37, sounding every bit his age as he adopts the cadence of music made almost exclusively by and for people younger than iTunes. It doesn’t help that many of his hip-hop nods resemble zeitgeist-y sounds from five years ago. “We back like bad teenagers,” Bear proclaims on “Walking in the Rain,” a would-be Astroworld leftover complete with hyperspace synths and Auto-Tuned interjections. “Off Road” sounds like a Roddy Ricch song about being stuck in traffic; the droning guitar and sludgy vocals on half the album are indebted to Lil Peep, minus the pathos and dread that made him compelling. Even when Bear brings on indie contemporary Ben Gibbard for “Hollywood,” he boxes the Death Cab for Cutie vocalist into a trap beat that combines with his airy tone like oil and water. The last time Bear positioned himself as a storyteller, on 2017’s Boo Boo, the results were ho-hum. As he tackles two notoriously lyric-heavy genres on Hole Erth, his weaknesses stick out more than ever. On stripper anthem “Babydaddy,” the best he can do is rhyme “UGA” with “MBA.” Elsewhere, he fills choruses with nice-sounding platitudes—“I was stone rolling, I was role playing, I was wind blowing”—that would be fine as window dressing, but come off as rambling when placed front-and-center in the mix. The two exceptions are “CD-R” and “Tuesday,” transmissions from Bear’s early days as an upstart musician with a refreshingly snotty attitude toward celebrity. “Blackberry days, I would talk to anyone,” he sings over a beat that sounds like it was extracted from a Y2K software package. It works a lot better than his extensive quoting of “Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old Girl” on “Heaven,” or the gratuitous Tom Petty reference propping up “Reseda.” When Bear stops trying to replicate the last vestiges of SoundCloud rap and merely takes a few cues from it, Hole Erth sounds more inspired. “Undercurrent,” a collaboration with Porches and Don Toliver, nails the unlikely partnership by crawling a new-wave guitar hook to a snail’s pace and having Toliver sing-rap over live drums. Out of all the guest stars here—including Kevin Abstract, Lev, DUCKWRTH, and Bear’s protégé Elijah Kessler—the one who shines brightest is Kenny Mason, who commands his verse on “Smoke” over moody piano and grunge-y acoustic guitar. With these songs, you can hear the love letter to aughts rap-rock that Bear aimed for, not a misguided attempt at catering to Fortnite players. Unfortunately, most of Hole Erth comes across like the latter.', \"Score\": 5.7},\n",
    "    {\"Date\": \"2024-09-10\", \"Artist\": \"Okay Kaya\", \"Album\": \"Oh My God - That’s So Me\", \"Genre\": \"Pop/R&B\", \"Text\": 'The Norwegian-American songwriter’s observations about contemporary states of distraction and detachment are compassionate and closely focused. If you thought Okay Kaya was taking liberties to question Dolly Parton on her last record, 2022’s SAP, then gird yourself for the targets on Kaya Wilkins’ fourth LP. “Picture This” begins by asking the listener to imagine themselves as “Sisyphus as a health-nut geologist” who is, once and for all, going to push that damn rock to the top. And the rock doesn’t like it one bit! “Who is this man with his clammy hands/And why is he defying/Gravity?” she sings from the once-victorious stone’s perspective. The 34-year-old Norwegian-American musician is here to rewrite the Greek myths, one nimble flip turning a 3000-year-old story into a neat wink about the fantasy of seizing control of one’s life; of conquering not just your health, but nature and fate. Better still, Wilkins doesn’t draw attention to how genuinely funny the lyrics are (“You want to be like your daddy/A rolling stone/Gain some speed and lose control,” she consoles the rock), instead all but smothering her run-on verses—sung in a head voice that suggests she’s low on oxygen—in languid, Moon Safari-worthy stardust. If Camus wrote that we must imagine the perpetually failing Sisyphus as happy, Wilkins’ unburdened hero has to be experiencing some degree of delusion. Smaller, similarly blinkered battles between man and nature play out across Oh My God - That’s So Me. The title phrase comes from the last song, the folky hymnal “The Art of Poetry,” in which someone looks at the moon and, “struck by familiarity,” utters it out loud. To fluttery woodwinds and loudening strings, Wilkins repeats the phrase over and over, seemingly captivated and a little horrified by the banality of seeing nature as nothing more than a mirror and a meme. Written and self-recorded on her new home on an island off Oslo only accessible by boat, Oh My God comes from a physical place of detachment, but puts a more organic spin on Wilkins’ usual lyrical Verfremdungseffekt. No longer does she leave lacerating lines suspended in mid-air, like a knife dangling off the edge of a table; her observations about contemporary states of distraction and detachment come wreathed in compassion and close focus. Without in any way lecturing about getting back to the land, there is the sense here that, somewhere along the line, humankind’s priorities have gone askew. No matter: They might yet be gently danced back onto the right track. In sublime standout “The Groke,” Wilkins coins her own myth of a stalking, wintry menace who’s either a sort of SAD selkie or the personification of the climate crisis—you decide—and writes her a theme tune: Miles-funky woodwind and woodblocks, strings with cartoonishly sharp verve, a chorus line intoning the hellhound’s name with a camp severity that implies you’d better watch your back. (While it doesn’t sound like U.S. Girls’ “4 American Dollars,” it nails the throwback brief just as expertly.) From the same school of finely turned disco wiggles as Arthur Russell’s poppiest moments, “Check Your Face” romances common sense—Wilkins urging it to “season me in reasoning,” and coming on so strong that there’s a good chance this would-be seducer doesn’t understand the equanimous object of her affections at all. It speaks subtly and incisively to how concepts like common sense, boundaries, and bandwidths have become buzzwords, but also sees the delusion of trying to conclusively attain them as endearing, as the coolest of basslines contrasts Wilkins’ exaggerated purr. The dreamier “Oh Minutiae” comes at the devotional affect from a different angle, a waltzing torch song played on what sounds like a cheap keyboard about the tiny rewards to be found in the world around you: the seaweed, “funny-looking oak leaves,” the “snowflakes and cornflakes” of a Norwegian winter. “They say the devil lies in the details,” Wilkins sings, coining another lovely, wonky aphorism: “I think that’s just a phrase … Not all good things are named after saints.” These funny, weird, tender songs are cast in a softer light than Wilkins’ previous albums, not least the unsettling SAP. Some may lament the lack of eeriness on Oh My God, but her adept songcraft, enveloping melodies, and mood-conjuring is sure-footed and enchanting—recalling Marry Me-era St. Vincent and the uncanniness of latter-day Cate Le Bon—and not short on off-kilter detail. Opener “The Wannabe” is straightforwardly rapturous, bluesy neo-soul that never lapses into pastiche because the sensuality Wilkins is craving is not rote carnality but that of basic human feeling: “I’m not a sculpture,” she sings. “I’ll take the frustrations/Just let me back into my body again.” “Help, I’ve Been Put Into Context!” laments the pinned-butterfly indignation of being incorrectly perceived with wry humor—“Stuck up on my hind legs/Speak in languages I never knew”—and tactile, rehumanizing beauty: chimes like tapped jars, snippets of soul drum fills, gently climbing acoustic chords. The fragility of all this is underpinned by the potential destruction lingering around the edges. “My Berenice,” a tale of obsession and breakup, is suspiciously pure and loving until the end flares with hysteria: “They say you dig your own grave,” sings Wilkins, building to a fit of pique, “but I dug hers too.” A cover of Shirley Collins’ 1960 song “Space Girl” (subtitled “(Shirley’s)”) is a prescient tale of a girl acting against her own interests, told through her mother’s warning against the dangerous lure of space technology; it winds up with Wilkins shrieking in a pained voice against sharp, bullheaded guitar. “And I Have a Blessed Life” is an insistent incantation of gratitude that clings on amid invocations of dread and seismic bass. “Life is Nietzsche on the beach/And then you die,” Wilkins sings in an ecstatic conclusion. The German philosopher once stated that how a man builds a sandcastle reveals his relationship to time: one panics; one refuses because of the inevitability of the coming waves; the wise man rolls up his sleeves and embraces the joy of building. The rock will always roll back down the mountain. But building as if the sand were stone—and laying some indelible bass lines in the process—are as good as a foundation gets.', \"Score\": 8.0},\n",
